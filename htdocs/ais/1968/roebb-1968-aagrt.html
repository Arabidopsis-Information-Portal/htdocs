<h2>Functionally different, allelic im mutants</h2><p>

The variegated mutant im (im1) was obtained by REDEI (cf.  1965, 1967)
after X-irradiation of presoaked seeds as a rare event.  Just so in
our mutation experiments with X-rays only a single im type (im 28)
within about 50,000 M2 families was found. After treatment of seeds or
pollen with alkylating agents (EMS, ethylene imine or ethylene oxide),
however, 64 new im mutants were observed in 22, 347 M2 families, i.e.,
over 100 times more than after the use of radiations.  No im mutant
ever appeared sponteneously.<p>

Of the total number of im mutants (some of which were sterile or
otherwise impaired) 31 separate lines could be established. These can
easily be grouped according to their light sensitivity (cf.  ROBBELEN,
1968) into at least three classes of phenotypes: the first class,
including 23 mutants is characterized by the mutant im 52, the second
with 6 types by im 56, while the third with the prototype im 245
contains the remaining 2 mutants. The table demonstrates that under
the same illumination im 52 rosettes are almost white, while
simultaneously grown im 245 plants are rather green and im 56
individuals intermediate. Though all of our mutants originated from
the same genetic line (En-2) and proved to be allelic without
exception, it now needs to be tested, whether their functional
differences are due to a change of different "mutons" within the same
gene or to different extragenic modifyers.<p>
