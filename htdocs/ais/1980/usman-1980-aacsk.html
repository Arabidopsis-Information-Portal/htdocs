During the analysis of efficiency of various mutagens in several cases
the phenomenon of "maximum mutations" is observed. Many hypotheses
explaining this phenomenon are suggested, the most significant of them
can be found in monographs of Soyfer and Dubinin (Soyfer, 1961;
Dubinin, 1976). These hypotheses are, however, applied mainly to
microorganisms and lower plants; for higher plants there are still not
satisfactory explanations of causes that underlie the mechanisms of
"maximum and decrease of mutations".<p>

The results of our experiments on mutagenic efficiency of
ethyleneimine (EI) made it possible to suggest a hypothesis that
explains one of the possible causes of mutation decrease at high
mutagen doses in higher plants.<p>

In the experiment carried out air-dry seeds were soaked for 18 hours
at various EI concentrations at +18*degrees*C with consequent sowing
of seeds into the soil in vegetative boxes and growth of plants at the
Alpine station of "Rui-Dasht". The EI efficiency was measured by the
frequency of chlorophyll mutations registered with the help of the
"embryo test" (Moller, 1963). Number of mutations per 100 initial
cells was the index of mutagen efficiency.<p>

after treatment of seeds with different concentrations of ethyleneimin
(EI).<p>

This value was determined both by the number of chimeric plants -Ma-
and numbr of mutant embyros -Mc- according to the formulas given in
the monograph of V.I. Ivanov (Ivanov, 1974).<p>

Designations are the same as in the above mentioned monograph. The
results are given in Table 1. Figure 1 represents "dose effect" curves
plotted by the method of sliding average (Urbach, 1964).<p>

Sharp distinction between mutation frequences of Ma and Mc deserves
consideration. While Mc curve grows with the increase of mutagen dose,
as it was expected, the Ma curve is characterized with strongly marked
maximum at EI concentration of 0.02 - 0.04%. At low concentrations Ma
values are significantly greater than corresponding Mc values and the
difference becomes insignificant only at concentrations above 0.04%
(Table 1).<p>

As both Ma and Mc values serve to estimate one and the same value the
observed difference shows that one of the methods of calculation is
based on wrong suggestions. Among them may be the acceptance of
independence of number of initial cells on mutagen dosage (Langridge,
1958; Ivanov, 1974).<p>

By segregation data of chimeric plants we counted the number of
initial cells for each EI concentration. The expected diminution of
the number of initial cells with the increase of mutagen dosage (chi
sq.4 = 24.6; P &lt; 0.001) was observed. The obtained values of number
of initial cells were used for a repeated calculation of mutation
frequency according to formula I. Corrected values of mutation
frequencies (Ma) are given in Table 1, the corresponding "dose effect"
curve is in Figure 1.<p>

Figure 1: Influence of number of initial cells on character of "dose
effect" curves.<p>

As it is shown in the figure the obtained curve rises monotonously
with the increase of dose and most interestingly it does not
practically differ from the Mc curve. As Mc values are not dependent
on the number of initial cells closeness of Ma and Mc values shows the
importance of taking into account the variation of number of initial
cells after EI treatment. The detected regularity will be obviously
true to other mutagenes. Therefore, for true interpretation of data in
experimental mutagenesis it is necessary to take into account the
possible dependence of the number of initial cells induced by mutagen
dosage. Otherwise there will be observed various apparent deviations
of the 'dose effect' curve from theoretic expectation which may lead
to the pseudophenomenon of "maximum and decrease of mutations".<p>

In conclusion it is necessary to point out that if the number of
initial cells is 2 it is quite sufficient for exposure of chimeric
plants to analyse every 5 pods per plant (Moller, 1963); at greater
numbers of initial cells this amount of pods will be insufficient.<p>

We have conducted necessary calculations of pod numbers (N) according
to the number of initial cells (Table 2).<p>

plants with fixed probability on number of initial cells.<p>
