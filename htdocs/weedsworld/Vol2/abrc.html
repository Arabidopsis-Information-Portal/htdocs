<H2>New Stocks and Catalog</H2>


        The 1995 ABRC Stock List has just gone to press and should be
mailed within three weeks.  Many new seed and DNA stocks are
included in this edition.  The collection of characterized mutants
now numbers approximately 300.   1600 new       T-DNA tagged
lines,  100 transposon tagged lines, promoter trap lines and 200
recombinant inbred lines are among the seed additions.  Besides
the Redei collection, we now have available most of the 300
ecotypes and 100 form mutants of the Kranz, Arabidopsis
Information Service (AIS) collection.  In addition to standard
bulk propagations of the AIS ecotypes, we now have available
single-seed stocks of most of this collection.  The stocks should
be very useful for researcher wishing to use this diverse
collection in experiments requiring initially homozygous material.
Note that the seed supplies of these lines are currently somewhat
more limited than for the bulk lines, and the latter should be
used for standard phenotypic screenings. <P>


        Major advancements have been achieved recently in DNA
holdings.  We have received two very useful cosmid libraries and
now possess several cDNA and one genomic library.  The collection
of cloned genes numbers near 100 and is growing rapidly as are the
holdings of RFLP stocks.  In addition, we have just received 9,000
new EST clones from Michigan State University (MSU).  These, along
with the 3,000  Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique
(CNRS) and 4,000 MSU ESTs already in our collection, have
increased these stocks to very large proportions. We also now hold
an P1 library from Mitsui Plant Biotechnology Research Institute
and RITE as well as a new YAC library from Joseph Ecker, which are
currently available but will be distributed as soon as the details
of their handling can be worked out. <P>

<H2>Stock ordering and information access improvements</H2>


        To simplify stock ordering we implemented the AIMS Mosaic
Ordering System in October 1994.  This system, which operates from
the Web address <A HREF="http://aims.cps.msu.edu/aims/">http://aims.cps.msu.edu/aims/</A>, now is utilized
for more than one-half of all stock orders to the ABRC.  Due to
the success of this system, we are now designing a Web-based stock
searching system which will be linked to AIMS Web server so that
stock location and subsequent ordering will become one process.
The seed searching part of this system has just been installed
(clicking <A HREF="http://aims.cps.msu.edu/aims/">HERE</A>will access it), and the DNA searching counterpart
should be ready in a couple of weeks.  The complete AIMS Web
server will have full searching capability for stock information,
gene and allele searching functions, and colleague and reference
accesses. <P>

        Stock image data is fully accessible from the Web server and
linked to the associated stocks.  We are trying to utilize these
images to their fullest potential to portray stock features.
<A HREF="abrcecotype.gif"">Ecotype</A> features can be portrayed and compared  
 as can various aspects of gene effects such as <A HREF="abrcdevelopment.gif">developmental</A>
features, experimental comparisons, and microscopic
characteristics of mutants. Most of our current images have been
generated with our own facilities and are simpler depictions of
the plants, but the greatest degree of informativeness is possible
when visual depictions produced by the initial investigators are
donated with the respective stocks, both for seeds and DNA.  See
the scans of slides for <A HREF="abrcde-etiolated.gif">de-etiolated2</A>, donated by the Joanne Chory
lab and the <A HREF="abrcfusca.gif">fusca comparison</A> donated by Linda Castle as examples
of the possibilities.  Hence, as always, we welcome new donations
along with information in both verbal and graphical form.  New
donations represent the strength of the stock centers, and the
donations have their fullest usefulness in accompaniment with
complete, accessible descriptions. <P>
