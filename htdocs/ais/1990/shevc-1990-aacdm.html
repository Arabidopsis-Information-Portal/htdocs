Phenomenon of alteration of the number of genetically effective cells
(GECN) in the course of ontogenesis of Arabidopsis thaliana plants
(wild type En) was shown by SHEVCHENKO and GRINIKH (1975). GECN
increased in the period "dormant seed-rosette" and this increase
probably could be accounted for by the existence of some initial cell
divisions in which none of the two sister cells differentiated, that
is both of them remained initial cells. After marking the initial
cells with mutations the plants were grown under different conditions;
in the period "rosette-bud" the plants of tube culture having rather
weak main racemes, GECN was smaller than in those with more vigorous
main racemes of soil culture (SHEVCHENKO and GRINIKH, 1985). This
decrease of the group size of genetically effective cells could
probably be accounted for by the existence of some initial cell
divisions in which none of the two sister cells remained initial, that
is both of them differentiated.<p>

This work was done to continue the study of this phenomenon. An
attempt was made to elucidate its mechanism by analysing the
dependence of GECN on the genotype, the stage of ontogenesis and on
the culture condition affecting the growth characters and seed
productivity of A. thaliana. The experiments were carried out with
various lines (wild types, marker lines, forms taken from natural
high-altitude population) and hybrids from the crosses between them.<p>

Wild types Est, La-er, Co, mutant line gl-1, hy-2, tt-5 and 6 natural
forms from the high-altitude population Shakdara (SHEVCHENKO and
GRINIKH, 1987) were used. The crosses between various pairs were made
and hybrid seeds were used for the experiments. The plants were grown
in soil or on mineral agar medium. For marking the initial cells with
mutations, the dormant seeds of parents and their hybrids were
simultaneously irradiated by gamma rays at the dose of 370 Gy for
estimating of GECN in the period "dormant seed-rosette", young plants
with 2 to 4 rosette leaves of the same parents; hybrids were
irradiated at the dose of 37 Gy for estimating the GECN in the period
"rosette-bud". In the experiments in which it was necessary to change
growth conditions, a half of the plants after marking was transplanted
from the agar medium to the soil and the other half continued growth
on the agar medium. Plant growth (its characters are given in Table 1;
100 to 200 plants were measured in each variant) and the frequency of
chlorophyll deficient mutations irrespective of their embryo size were
estimated. The dose of irradiation used, usually induced from 10% to
15% mutant plants. GECN was calculated on the basis of mutant sector
size in the main racemes; in each raceme 5 and 10 siliques were scored
after irradiation of dormant seeds and plants at rosette stage,
respectively.<p>

* the data on the parents of these hybrids were presented by
SHEVCHENKO and GRINIKH (1987); they were obtained in the same
experiments where the hybrids are analysed.<p>

The results of the analysis of growth characters and GECN are given in
Tables 1 and 2. Both in soil and in tube culture GECN studied
increased 2 to 4 times in the period "dormant seed-rosette" when rapid
growth of vegetative mass of the plants took place. Thus, the increase
of GECN in ontogenesis did not depend on the genotype, heterozygosity
or growth conditions. The data on Est, La-er and their hybrids grown
in different conditions after marking of initial cells confirmed the
earlier observation made of the wild type Co; later in ontogenesis (in
the period "rosette-bud") in the plants which with less favourable
growth GECN was smaller than in the plants grown under conditions
which promoted the development of more vigorous racemes. Hence this
phenomenon also did not depend on the genotype or heterozygosity. The
7 A. thaliana hybrids obtained and studied in this work were all
similar to one of their parents and did not distinguish by an
increased growth or reproductive power, i.e. heterosis was not
observed in the crosses carried out. It should be noticed that in all
the material studied GECN of hybrid in the period "rosette-bud" was
usually nearer to GECN of that parent to which this hybrid was nearer
by the characters reflecting growth and reproductive power.<p>
