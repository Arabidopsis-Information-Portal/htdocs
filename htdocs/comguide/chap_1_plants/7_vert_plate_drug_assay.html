THE VERTICAL-PLATE ASSAY FOR DRUG RESISTANCE IN 
ARABIDOPSIS

*  In the course of research I have needed to make quantitative 
comparisons of drug resistance in plants both to examine drug-resistant 
mutants and to characterise transgenic plants.  Root length can be used 
as a rapid and quantitative assay for drug sensitivity, but the roots of 
plants grown in petri-dishes usually become tangled and difficult to 
remove intact.  This problem can be avoided by tipping the plates to a 
vertical position so that the roots grow down along the surface of the 
agar.  (Similar methods have been used to study gravitropism [Kahler 
and Bell, 1990 Plant Science 66, 131-138.].)

1.  PROCEDURE
  (i) Sterilise the seeds in 70% ethanol for 2 min and then in 10% 
household bleach + 0.15 % Triton for 10 min.
  (ii) Wash with four changes of sterile distilled water.
  (iii) Tip the seeds onto a sterile agar surface and pick individual seeds 
with a toothpick to form a row of 30-50 seed approximately 1 cm from the 
edge of a square petri-dish (e.g., Sterilin 103 x 100 mm, catalogue 
number 109).
 *  Any medium that supports the rapid growth of Arabidopsis can be 
used.  Typically, I use  Murashige and Skoog medium with 1% sucrose 
and 0.8% agar.  Drugs from concentrated  stocks to the appropriate final 
concentration can be added to the plates before pouring the  agar 
solution.

  (iv) Seal the plates with two layers of Nescofilm and incubate in the light 
in a vertical position with the line of seeds at the top.
  (v) After two weeks, the seedlings can be removed from the plate and 
corresponding root-lengths measured.  At this time, the control roots 
should be from 3-7 cm in length.  I used an average of 10 
roots/line/treatment.
 *  The only problem with this method is that of condensation building up 
at the bottom of the plates.  In general, it is better to use dry plates.

2.  EXAMPLE
 *  Presented below is an example of the kind of data that can be 
generated using this method.
