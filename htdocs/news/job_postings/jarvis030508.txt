Ref: R3654 
 
A BBSRC-funded postdoctoral position is available immediately for a strongly motivated 
individual to study novel nuclear mutations that affect the efficiency of chloroplast 
protein import in the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. The mutations were identified in 
forward-genetic screens for extragenic suppressors of the well-characterised chloroplast 
protein import mutants, ppi1 and tic40. Applicants should have a PhD and a strong 
background in a relevant discipline. Experience of molecular biology research will be 
essential, and experience of research on Arabidopsis and/or organelle biology will be 
highly desirable.
