HYLANDER (1957) suggested first that Arabidopsis suecica (FR.) NORRL.
is an amphiploid of Cardaminopsis arenosa (L.) HAYEK and Arabidopsis
thaliana (L.)HEYNH. Subsequently LOVE (1961) considered the hypothesis
so plausible that he renamed the plant as Hylandra suecica (FR.) LOVE.
MESICEK (1967) questioned the validity of this hypothesis concerning
the evolution of Hylandra because his attempt to hybridize C. arenosa
with Arabidopsis failed just as an earlier attempt of LAIBACH (1958)
was unsuccessful.  MESICEK, however, succeeded in producing a steril
hybrid of C. petraea (n=16) x Arabidopsis.  In our laboratory we
produced viable seed by crossing C. arenosa (2n=32) with Arabidopsis
(2n=20).  The majority of the seed developed into crippled seedling
with distorted narrow leaves, a few however appeared as vigorous
plants resembling more C. arenosa than Hylandra. Actually none of the
traits characteristic for Hylandra could be revealed in the F1.  The
fertility in F1 was fairly good. The F2 generation segregated into a
few different types, including some with narrow leaves.  The C.
arenosa x Arabidopsis hybrid could be easily crossed with Hylandra.
This F1 also displayed fairly good fertility and it was uniform and
intermediate type without any clear Hylandra traits. The F2 of the
triple hybrid segregated in manner similar to the C. arenosa x
Arabidopsis F2.  The Hylandra x (C. arenosa x Arabidopsis) F1 was
morphologically different from the Hylandra x C. arenosa or Hylandra x
Arabidopsis (2n=10) hybrids. C. petraea was successfully crossed with
a dominant of Arabidopsis.  The only vigorous survivor was steril
(2n=13) and expressed the dominant yellow-green trait of the
Arabidopsis male parent. The evidence at hand does not lend much
support to the HYLANDER-LOVE hypothesis concerning the evolution of
Hylandra. Thus the origin of Hylandra requires more penetrating
experimental studies before firm conclusions can be drawn.<p>
