PhD-level research/teaching assistantships will be available in the lab of Dr. 
Ben Holt starting in Fall 2007 (earlier start dates are possible). The Holt Lab 
is interested in the roles of combinatorial transcription factors in plant 
development (http://www.ou.edu/cas/botany-micro/faculty/holt.html). Projects 
involving both Arabidopsis and Medicago will be available to interested and 
qualified applicants. Successful candidates must meet the following 
requirements:

1) B.S. or Master's Degree
2) Coursework in cellular, molecular, and developmental biology
3) Relevant experience in molecular biology, biochemistry, and/or genetics. 
Experience with plants is a plus, but not an absolute requirement
4) Fulfill requirements for admission and apply to both the OU Graduate College 
(http://gradweb.ou.edu/) and the Department of Botany and Microbiology 
(http://www.ou.edu/cas/botany-micro/form.shtml)

While interested applicants can apply directly to the graduate college and 
department, applicants are encouraged to initially email a CV and cover letter 
to Dr. Ben Holt at benholt@ou.edu - please use the subject line "Graduate School 
Inquiry." The cover letter should detail the candidates specific motivations for 
pursuing graduate school, relevant experiences, and describe why the candidate 
might make a good fit in the Holt Lab.
