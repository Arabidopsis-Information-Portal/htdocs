Vol 01S: <h2>Germination Response to Light on Dry Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana</h2><p>

C. A REHWALDT<p>

Dry seeds are considered to be relatively insensitive to light
(EVENARI, 1965). However, germination responses to large amounts of
light on air-dried seeds have been reported. BORTHWICH et al. (1954)
obtained a red far-red light response in seeds of Lactuca sativa.
JOHNSON and IRGENS-MOLLER (1964) detected a response to 12 hr of 3200
ergs/cm2 red light on seeds of Pseudotsuga menziesii (MIRB.) FRANCO
NYMAN (1963) detected a response to 24 hr of 4000 lux white light on
dry seeds of Pinus silvestris. No high intensity to light by
desiccant-dried seeds appears to have been previously reported.<p>

The experiments reported here are part of a larger study on the
inheritance of seed dormancy of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) HEYNH.
(doctoral thesis, unpublished). The studies were conducted to test the
sensitivity of desiccant-dried and dark stored seeds to brief
exposures of light during the planting stage of dark germination
tests.<p>

Materials and Methods: Seeds of the Landsberg ecotype of A.  thaliana
were used. The original seed stock was obtained from Dr. G.  P.
REDEI, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri. The plants from
which seed collections were made, were grown at 24 + 2 *degrees* C, 55
+/- 5 % relative humidity, and a 20 hr day with 1500 ft-c fluorescent
light. All seeds were stored 7 days in the dark over CaSO4 at 25
*degrees* C.<p>

A green safe-light was used for the transfer of seeds at the time of
planting and as a light source in several treatments. Green light
(495-575 *micro*; peak 525 *micro*) was obtained by filtering
incandescent light (40 watt green frosted bulb) through 3 cm of CuSO4
(100 g CuSO4. 5H2) per liter) and 2 layers of green cellulose acetate
filter.<p>

In the first experiment, aliquot samples of dry seeds were treated as
follows: no light, 4 and 20 sec irradiation by green light, 20 sec
irradiation by 500 ft-c incandescent light. Approximately 200 seeds
were distributed over 3 plates for each treatment sample. All seeds
were dark imbibed with 10=3 M KNO3 for 60 hr at 7*degrees*C and dark
incubated for 72 to 84 hr at 25*degrees*C. A random block design with
3 replicates was used. Significant differences were determined at the
5% level of probablility by analysis of variance and the LSD (least
significant difference). Arc sin transformed values were used.<p>

The second experiment was similar to the first except that the
treatments were: no light, 10, 30, and 120 sec of irradiation by 500
ft- c incandescent light. Two replicates were made.<p>

Results: The data of the first experiment are shown in Table 1.  The
LSD was 6.78 based on a significant F ( F = 60.22; df = 3,6) at the 5%
level of probability. Germinability was decreased by 20 sec of 500
ft-c incandescent light. The apparent increase in germinability by 20
sec of green light is near the level of significance. The data of the
second experiment are shown in Table 2. The LSD was 15.03. The F ( F =
5.46; df = 3,3) was not significant at the 5% level of probability.
The 10 and 30 sec irradiation periods decreased the germinability
level in comparison to the dark control.<p>

Discussion: The two experiments here reported show that desiccant-
dried and dark stored seeds possess a high level of sensitivity to
short irradiations of incandescent light. The response appears to be
complex since the inhibitory effect obtained by short exposures is
lost by longer periods of irradiation. The possibility that extended
periods of irradiation are stimulatory was not investigated. The
complex response to incandescent light suggests that the phytochrome
system is involved in the light response by dry seeds.  This is
further supported by the apparent tendency for higher germinability by
20 sec of green light.  SHROPSHIRE et al. (1961) found that green
light was stimulatory for imbibed seeds of A.  thaliana. BORTHWICH et
al. (1954) found that air- dried lettuce seed responded to red and far
red light. Red and far red light experiments are needed to determine
the relative sensitivity of desiccant-dried and dark-stored seed.<p>

The high light sensitivity found in desiccant-dried, dark-stored seed
may be dependent upon the storage conditions. This has not been
studied. The results of these experiments demonstrate the importance
of light control for germination tests based on dark seed storage and
dark incubation procedures.<p>

Summary: The germinability of desiccant-dried and dark stored seeds of
Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) HEYNH. was sensitive to brief irradiations
of incandescent light. Germinability was decreased by 10, 20, and 30
sec, but not by 120 sec of irradiation with 500 ft-c.  Though not
significant, there was an apparent increase in germinability by 3=20
sec of irradiation with green light.<p>
