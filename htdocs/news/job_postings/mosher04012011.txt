The University of Arizona School of Plant Sciences is seeking a postdoctoral research associate with 
expertise in molecular biology and genetics. The Mosher laboratory 
(http://cals.arizona.edu/research/mosherlab) is looking for a motivated and enthusiastic individual 
to perform research on small RNA-directed DNA methylation in the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana 
and other plant species. The qualified applicant will use advanced molecular biological techniques, 
including high-throughput sequencing technologies, to answer fundamental questions in eukaryotic gene 
regulation. Proven expertise in molecular biology techniques and excellent oral and written 
communication skills are required. Laboratory research is supported by dedicated bioinformatic staff, 
but a sound understanding of high throughput sequencing and prior experience with genomic analysis 
are highly desired. The ability to work both independently and collaboratively is essential. 

  

Duties and responsibilities: 
-Carry out high-quality laboratory research. 
-Communicate results in oral and written form. 
-Develop new research objectives as appropriate. 
-Supervise graduate or undergraduate students. 

Minimum qualifications: 
-A PhD in the field of molecular biology, genetics, or related discipline. 
-Proven experience with molecular biology techniques. 
-Effective oral and written communication skills and excellent organization. 
-Ability to work both independently and collaboratively. 

Preferred Qualifications: 
-A sound understanding of the challenges of large datasets, including statistical analysis. 
-Prior experience with high-throughput (next-generation) sequencing. 

Applications, including a letter of interest and a CV listing contact information for 3 references,
