<h2> An attempt to sensitize Arabidopsis seeds to gamma irradiation after BUdR treatment</h2><p>

The increase of sensitivity to radiation injury after thymidine
analogue incorporation has been shown by several authors in
microrganisms, in mammalian and human cells (KAPLAN et al, 1960;
DJORDEVIC and DJORDEVIC, 1965; DEWEY et al, 1966; DJORDEVIC and
SZYBALSKI, 1960).  KIHMAN (1963) reported an increase in the rate of
chromosome breaks due to X-rays in Vicia faba roots pretreated with
5-bromodeoxyuridine.  Such a kind of experiment is dexcribed here with
Arabidopsis and this also includes the mutagenic effects induced in M2
generation.<p>

Dry seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana, race Wil2, were pretreated by
immersing seeds in a 10 E-3M BudR solution for 24h at 24*degrees*C.
Control seeds were soaked in water.  Then, they were irradiated in a
Gamma-Cell (3000 C, 60Co) at 23*degrees*C with doses of 10, 25 and 50
krad.  Seeds were immediately sown in boxes in the glasshouse and
transplanted in pots after full development of the first leaves.
Various characteristics of the vegetative and reproductive development
were studied and also the chlorophyll mutants in M2 generation. The
results are summarized in Table 1.<p>

Table 1: (1) Percentage of germination 7 days after sowing.  (2)
Percentage of plants with 4 leaves after 13 days.  (3) Percentage of
flowering 30 days after sowing.  (4) Percentage survival at maturity
among transplanted plants. (5) Degree of fertility measured as number
of seeds per pod.  (6) Frequency of M2 chlorophyll mutations<p>

Plants treated only with BUdR are not affected in their developmental
cycle, except for a little decrease in germination rate and fertility.
An increase to radiation sensitivity may be noted in these seeds for
developmental characteristics as regards to those obtained inhuman
cell lines (DJORDEVIC and SZYBALSKI, 1960).  On the contrary, the
presence of the analogue decreases the inhibition of the flowering
process due to gamma-rays. Fertility is clearly much affected and this
fact can be related to the enhancement of chromosomal aberrations
produced in the embro cells as reported by KIHLMAN (1963) in Vicia
faba.  There is some evidence for an increase in mutational
radiosensitization of the seeds treated with BUdR, but only at low
doses of gamma rays.  It may be possible that some radiation damages
are made irreversible by BUdR treatment, but this effect is masked for
doses like 25 or 50 krad by the amount of perturbations induced in
presoaked seeds by irradiation alone.<p>

As BUdR is uptaken and incorporated into seeds of Arabidopsis (JACOBS,
1968), it can be assumed that the mechanism of sensitization to
gamma-rays by this thymidine analogue is related to its incorporation
into DNA.  Similar experiments with seeds harvested from plants grown
on a medium containing BUdR are now in progress.<p>
