POSDOCTORAL RESEARCH ASSOCIATE @ TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY:  A 
postdoctoral position is available immediately for a highly motivated researcher to join a 
functional genomics program studying the effect of environmental stress on modulating 
gene expression, fertilization and seed development, and traits associated with grain 
quality in wheat and Arabidopsis.  Candidates should have research and publication 
experience in some of the following areas; plant gene expression, standard molecular 
biology techniques, positional cloning, plant tissue culture, plant physiology and or gene 
transformation of cereals. The incumbent will be responsible for making normalized 
cDNA libraries, selecting non-redundant genes for microarray applications, and 
analyzing the role of genes of unknown functions from these arrays using reverse 
genetics in Arabidopsis. The incumbent will have an opportunity to develop an 
independent research program through the development of federal and state grants, and 
be encouraged to attend scientific meetings, and develop collaborative research projects 
through interactions with plant genomics groups, breeders, and cereal chemists on and off 
the Texas A&M campus.  The supervisor will actively assist the candidates in achieving 
their career goals. The postdoctoral candidate will be paid competitively with benefits, 
and medical according to their experience.  Candidates should send a statement of their 
career goals, copy of transcripts, and a curriculum vitae including names, email addresses 
and phone numbers of three references to: Dr. Dirk B. Hays, Molecular and 
Environmental Plant Sciences, Soil and Crop Sciences Department, Texas A&M 
University, 2474-TAMU, College Station, TX 77843 979-458-0032 phone, 979-845-
8924 laboratory, 979-845-0456 FAX, dbhays@neo.tamu.edu.  Screening will begin upon 
receipt of applications and September 17, 2004.
