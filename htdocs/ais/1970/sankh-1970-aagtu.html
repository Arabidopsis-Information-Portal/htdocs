<h2> Effect of the growth retardants potassium nitrate, thiourea, and gibberellin on seed germination of Arabidopsis thaliana</h2><p>

Like gibberellic acid (GA), potassium nitrate and thiourea are also
well known as effective promotors of germination in positively
photoblastic seeds (EVENARI, 1965).  In contrast, growth retardants as
well as coumarin act as inhibitors of seed germination (CATHEY, 1964;
KNYPL, 1967).  However, exogenously applied GA can effectively
overcome the inhibitory effect of these chemicals in several plant
systems including seed germination (CATHEY, 1964; RENNERT and KNYPL,
1967). The apparent similarity of the effects of GA, KNO3, and
thiourea encouraged us to plan some experiments to explore, whether
the latter chemicals, like GA, also counteract the inhibitory effect
of growth retardants or not. The results of this study will be
reported in this communication.<p>

It is clear that when the seeds were germinated at 25*degrees*C under
a light intensity of about 1000 lux as detailed earlier (SANKHLA and
SAHKHLA, 1968) all the three growth retardants tested (Table)
inhibited the germination of seeds to a very great extent, although
phosfon indicated some toxic effects.  GA and KNO3, on the other hand,
appeared to enhance the rate of seed germination.  Thiourea, when
alone, did not elicit any positive effect on the rate of seed
germination. Furthermore, it was observed that in appropriate
concentrations KNO3, GA, as well as thiourea greatly reversed the
effect of CCC on seed germination.<p>

potassium nitrate, thiurea, and GA on germination of Arabidopsis<p>

Earlier we observed that in lettuce, strain 'Attraktion', CCC
inhibited the germination of seeds only slightly while in strain
"Rapids' it proved completely ineffective in inhibiting the
germination.  Not only this, in strain 'Attraktion' thiourea when
applied simultaneously with CCC, reversed the inhibition of root
growth caused by the growth retardant.  In strain 'Rapide' on the
other hand, thiourea did not indicate any positive response on
seedling growth either alone or in the presence of CCC (SANKHLA,
1970).  In some mutant of Arabidopsis also neither thiourea nor KN03
could reverse the inhibition of seed germination caused by CCC (our
unpublished data).  These results indicate differential behaviour and
specificity of the response elicited by two strains of the same
species. A similar behaviour of specificity of response to added
growth retardants has also been reported earlier for different
cultivars of other species (CATHEY, 1964).  Our present knowledge
indicates that growth retardants (in particular CCC) affect auxin-,
gibberellin-, cytokinin-, and choline metabolism of the treated plants
(CATHEY, 1964; RENNERT, and KNYPL, 1967; TUNG and RAGHAVEN, 1968).
Thioures, on the other hand, is known to change the activity of
hydrolytic enymes, to effect respiration, alter the nature and amount
of naturally occuring endogenous growth regulators and affect nucleic
acid metabolism (POLJAKOFF-MAYBER and MAYER, 1960).  Recent evidences
suggest that in reversing the effect of growth retardants KN03 as well
as KCl, like GA, might also act through their effect on DNA, RNA and
protein synthesis (SANKHLA, 1969; KNYPL, 1969).  Therefore, it might
be possible that KNO3, thiourea, and gibberellin reverse the
inhibition of seed germination caused by CCC, by stimulating the
metabolism in a balanced way.<p>
