<h2>A note on the growth response of Arabidopsis in culture media containing deoxyriboside base analogues</h2><p>

	The recent report by HIRONO and REDEI (1966) concerning the effect of deoxyriboside base analogues on flowering in Arabidopsis is of particular significance since in contrast to earlier work (BROWN, 1962; JACOBS, 1964) these authors elicited a striking morphogenetic response when base analogues were incorporated into the culture media on which the plants were grown, without inhibition of growth at the reported analogue concentration of 1 x 10E-5M.<p>

	In attempting a confirmatory experiment, 5-iododeoxy-uridine (IUdR) at a concentration of 5 x 1-E4M in the agar media was used. This concentration when in the media caused complete inhibition of seedling growth in both wild type and late flowering mutants.  SMITH (1962) reported that 5 x 10E-5M IUdR in the agar media for Arabidopsis was a threshold concentration "which barely permits plants to mature".  However, both 5 x 1-E-4M and 5 x 1-E-5M are morphogenetically active and non-inhibitory when applied topically to the vegetative plant axil in conjunction with 0.1% "Tween 20".<p>

	The base analogues IUdR and BUdR were applied originally directly to the apex because of the effects reported by SMITH, and also because autoradiographic studies using 3H-thymidine in the culture media (BROWN unpub.) indicated that while heavy incorporation of this nucleoside occurred within 4 hours in the root meristem, plants grown throughout their life cycle on mineral agar containing 2.5 --/ml of 3H-thymidine showed no autoradiographic evidence of incorporation into the bud tissue.  This is supported by work reported by GIFFORD (1960).  Incorporation of IUdR into root meristem DNA analogously to thymidine has been demonstrated by SMITH et al.  (1963).  Thus, using 3H-thymidine as an indicator for the incorporation and transport of IUdR and BUdR, it was expected that these analogues would not be transported to the shoot apex as such, when they were supplied in the agar edia and entered via the roots.  SEBESTA (1962 pers. comm.) stated that BUdR in the germinating solution did not effect growth of cucumber seedlings, though bromo-uracil was morphogenetically active (SORMOVA et al., 1960), while EVANS and AXELROD (1961) demonstrated that C14 labelled uracil and thymine in the germinating solution of rape seeding was mostly degraded to beta-amino-isobutyrate and very little was incorporated as metabolically active pyrimidine.<p>

	The questions posed by these results are several.<p>

	(1) What is the reason for the differential inhibitory threshold in shoot vs. root modes of application?<p>

	(2) Is the metabolic fate and mode of action of these analogues the same in both shoot and root modes of entry?<p>

	(3) If the deoxyriboside analogue itself, analogously to the case with 3H-thymidine, is not transported via the root to the shoot apex, what is the morphogenetically active molecule that acts on the shoot meristem?<p>

	Further researches on the metabolism and mode of action of the competitive DNA base analogues in higher plants are indicated and are continuing at this laboratory.<p>
