Postdoctoral Position in Soybean Genetics and Genomics
A full-time Postdoctoral Research Associate position in Soybean Genetics and
Genomics is available in the Department of Agronomy at Purdue University.
The successful candidate will apply integrated approaches (such as QTL
mapping, association mapping, genome scan, reverse genetics, and comparative
genomics) to identifying and characterizing genes/QTLs that underlie complex
traits in soybean, and be expected to contribute to a variety of studies on
structural, functional and evolutionary genomics in Dr. Jianxin Ma's
laboratory. We are part of Purdue University Agricultural Genomics Center
equipped with the state of the art genomics and bioinformatics facility, and
are involved in the Plant Biology and Molecular Evolutionary Genetics
training groups of Purdue University Interdisciplinary Life Science Program
(PULSe).
Applicants should have a PhD in Plant Genetics and Breeding, Plant Molecular
Biology, Computational Biology or related discipline. Experience in linkage
and association mapping, comparative and/evolutionary genomics, and DNA/RNA
hands-on techniques is highly desired. Experience in high throughput genomic
data mining and bioinformatics (e.g., PERL programming) in Linux would be a
definite plus. Salary is commensurate with experience and qualifications.
The position is available immediately.
Please email your cover letter, curriculum vitae, and names and addresses of
three references to Dr. Jianxin Ma (maj@purdue.edu<mailto:maj@purdue.edu>),
Department of Agronomy, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907.
