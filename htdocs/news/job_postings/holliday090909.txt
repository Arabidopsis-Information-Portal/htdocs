Funding is available starting January, 2010 for a graduate student (at the M.S. or Ph.D. 
level) to study evolutionary genomics of climate-related stress tolerance in forest trees at 
Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Department of Forest Resources and 
Environmental Conservation, in Blacksburg, Virginia (http://www.forestry.vt.edu/). 
Requirements for this position include a B.S. or equivalent in an applicable field (e.g., 
Biology, Forestry, Molecular Biology), successful completion of the GRE (general test 
only), and demonstrable experience and interest in evolution and population genetics. 
The successful candidate will join a collaborative group in the Molecular Plant Sciences 
program ( http://www.molplantsci.org.vt.edu/) with strengths in molecular biology, 
genomics and proteomics. The specific research project will be open to discussion, but 
may include genome-scale searches for the genetic targets of natural selection, genotype-
phenotype association studies, or landscape genomics. Some field work will be required. 
Assistantship includes tuition, health coverage, and a competitive stipend. If interested, 
please forward your CV, unofficial transcripts, and a description of your research 
interests to Dr. Jason Holliday (jah1@vt.edu) 
(http://www.forestry.vt.edu/Faculty/JasonHolliday.html)
