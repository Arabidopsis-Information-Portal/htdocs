	An atomic reactor was built in 1964 in Kyoto University and it was named Kyoto University Reactor (KUR).  Studies in higher plants of RBE values of neutrons for several characters have been investigated by our reasearch group using KUR (MATSUMURA et al., unpubl.)  Among them the killing effect of thermal neutrons in Arabidopsis was studied by the author. Dry and 48 hour steeped seeds were used and exposed to thermal neutrons by the pneumatic tube which was provided in the reactor; the length of irradiation time was 7 sec in minimum and 180 sec in maximum at the output of 1 MW.  The 7 sec irrradiation of dry seeds showed merely 19% of survival rate, and no survival of plants was observed in other lots.<p>

	After the above experience, the output of the reactor was decreased to 50 kW in the second experiment and observations were repeated; the details of irradiation and survival rates are given in the table with the results of gamma-ray irradiations.  Gamma-ray irradiations for dry seeds had almost no effect, but a slight decrease of survival rate was observed in 100 kR lot. Decrease of survival rate was marked in wet seed lots.  In the neutron lots, killing effects were severe and no survival of dry seeds was observed following 180 sec irradiation with neutrons contminated with 45 kR of gamma-rays.<p>

	Higher killing effects in the wet seeds were also seen in the neutron lots, but this might be the result of the contaminating gamma-rays since the environmental modification of radiation effect is very small in high LET radiations, while it is rather large with sparsely ionizing radiations. These results show that the killing effect of thermal neutrons was very high.  RBE of thermal neutrons on somatic mutations will be examined in the next step of the experiment and RBE versus LET relations should be determined.<p>
