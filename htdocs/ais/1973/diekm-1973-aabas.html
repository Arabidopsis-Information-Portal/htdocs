<h2> Interactions between phytochrome (Pfr), gibberellic acid (GA3) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (C-AMP) in seed germination of heteroallelic genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) HEYNH</h2><p>

The seed germination of the genotypes ch+/ch+ ch1/ch1, ch2/ch2 and
ch3/ch3 and the wildtype En-2 (ch+) has been examined. The germination
decreases significantly in the seeds grown for several generations
under abnormal conditions of yellow light (HEHL and KRANZ, 1971).  In
order to explain the causes of these reactions, the seeds have been
treated with GA3, red (R=660 nm) and far-red (FR=700 nm) light. We got
the following results:<p>

1) In ch+/ch+ and ch3/ch3 light is obligatory, but in ch1/ch1 and
ch2/ch2 facultative for seed germination.<p>

2) The genotypes are not qualitatively defective in the phytochrome
system, but a lower Pfr-content is apparently present in the seeds of
the other plants grown under yellow light (McCOLLOUGH and SHROPSHIRE,
1970).<p>

3) The active form of phytochrome (Pfr) cannot trigger complete
germination in the seeds for which light is obligatory. Certain
amounts of GA3 must be added to get germination of all seeds.<p>

4) Permanent treatment with yellow light results in
"Dauermodifikation" of the seed germination in the following
generations.  Apparently the decrease of native gibberellic acid
causes this behaviour.<p>

5) We suppose, that in the wildtype the de-novo synthesis of
gibberellic acid is completely blocked, but in the other genotypes
this block is partial and therefore quantitative.<p>

Table 1: Number (p.c.) of germinated seeds in four genotypes (I3y) of
A.thaliana treated to GA3, FR and R.  (FR: far red light, 56.4 x 10**3
erg/cm**2.sec; R: red light, 52.4 x 10**3 erg/cm**2.sec, temperature
2.25+-2.5(degrees)C)<p>

The behaviour in seed germination induced by these treatments can be
demonstrated by the example of the third inbred generation (I3y) grown
under yellow light (Table 1).  GA3 and R (Pfr) promote the germination
in the four genotypes. While the maximum of germination can only be
induced by GA3 plus R, R alone induces this maximum in ch2/ch2, i.e.
GA3 substitutes just under the action of R. &#207;rom this result we
suppose, that Pfr acts by GA3 on the germination.<p>

But, how does the Pfr promote the seed germination?  To explain this
the seeds of the four genotypes produced under normal light were
additionally treated with C-AMP or 5' - AMP.  Figure 1 shows the
reactions of those seeds for which light is obligatory. Evidently
C-AMP with and without R promotes the germination in ch+/ch+, but
under these conditions 5'-AMP stops the seed germination of both
genotypes, especially when GA3 is absent. Comparatively GA3 is most
effective, as it can be seen when the seeds are treated with GA3
alone.<p>

Therefore the reaction chain in the seed germination of A.thaliana can
be formulated as follows:<p>

Our results confirm the supposition repeatedly stated (MOHR, 1972;
SHROPSHIRE, 1972) that C-AMP operates as a "second messenger" of Pfr
in the seed germination.<p>
