During the last years we have studied the in vivo photo-transformation
of the chlorophyll as well as the phytochrome in certain mutants of
Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh.  (Kranz 1973, 1976).  Schemes of the
phytochrome system presented there, show 6 to 7 pigment groups, the
precursor P648-52(Pr'), the physiologically inactive P655-58(Pr),
three intermediates of photototransformation P664-67' P696-99' and
P704-10' and the activated forms of Pfr (P717-19' P724-33).  At this
time we could not truely decide whether some of the observed
absorption bands belong to phytochrome or to chlorophyll, although
under the conditions of the expriments applied to etiolated seedlings
the amount and the synthesis of chlorophyll were extremely low, i.e.
significantly lower than 10 micro g per fresh weight. Thus,
chlorophyll interference of the magnitude which was realized
experimentally in phytochrome measurements by Grill (1977) could be
excluded.<p>

Nevertheless, in order to overcome this problem of phytochrome plus
chlorophyll mixture under in vivo conditions, the use of mutant lines
characterized by defective chlorophyll biosynthesis was assigned.
Furthermore, some of these mutants proved to react abnormal in
photomorphogenesis which has been induced by red/far red light (Kranz
1974, 1977).  These findings provide further evidence to clarify the
following questions: Are the mutated genes expressed in the regulation
of i) the biogenesis of the photomorphogenetic sensor pigment itself,
ii) the phototransformation of the phytochrome system, or of iii) the
primary reactions of the effector pigment?<p>

Spectrophotometric data of in vivo experiments presented in this study
yield further evidence for an abnormal biogenesis and/or
phototransformation of the phytochrome in the wildtype as well as the
variegated mutant line im 52.  However, all the regulations mentioned
above proved to be normal in the chlorophyll b-defective mutant ch2.<p>

Materials and Methods<p>

Seeds (Arabidopsis thaliana L. Heynh.) of the standard wildtype
ch+/ch+ (72/92), the chlorophyll b-defective mutant ch2/ch2 (72/94),
and the variegated mutant line im52/im52 (=V52, 63/3/1 received from
the AIS-seed bank, Frankfurt/Main, were sown on double paper filter
moistened with 2 ml sterile aqueous solution of gibberellic acid (GA3
10-3M) per petri dish. The seeds germinated under complete darkness at
a temperature of 25*degrees*C +/- 2*degrees*C in a period of 15+/- 3
days.  Spectrophotometric techniques used for measuring the absorbance
of the pigments and the computation of the difference spectra yielded
from far-red (lambda max = 730 +/- 10.5 nm, 52.6 microWatt/cm**-2/sec)
minus red (lambda max = 660 +/- 10.5 nm, 49.9 microWatt/cm**-2/sec)
actinic light (5 minutes respectively) or vice versa were equal to
those already described (Kranz 1976); only the sample holder was
changed for cooling to constant temperature of 15*degrees*C +/-
1*degree*C.  One experiment consisting of measuring 5 absorption
spectra from lambda = 620 to 750 nm and 2 intermittent actinic light
treatments lasted less than 30 minutes.<p>

Results<p>

Analysis of in vivo absorption spectra of the etiolated seedlings
yielded significant differences between the 3 genotypes studied.
Maximum absorbance of the wildtype seedlings (ch+) was measured in the
spectral range between lambda = 640 and 660 nm probably indicating
precursor substances of phytochrome and/or chlorophyll.  However, in
the mutant ch2 there is one absorption peak in the range of lambda = 650
to 660 nm, a second peak near lambda = 680 nm, and a smaller peak at about
lambda = 720 nm probably resembling Pr, chlorophyllide holochrome, and one
of the forms of activated phytochrome Pfr respectively.  In ch2 the
absorption band at lambda = 680 nm was also obtained in earlier
experiments (Kranz 1976). On the contrary, the spectra of the
variegated mutant line im 52 are relatively flat and uniform showing
some minor absorption values from lambda = 670 to 720 i.e., the maximum
absorption range of the chlorophyll and the Pfr-forms. Albthough,
these results yielded some evidence for defective biogenesis of the
phytochrome and the chlorophyll in etiolated seedlings of im52, more
detailed analysis of the phototransformation of the pigments involved
were necessary especially after treating the subjects with actinic
light (r and fr).  However, the in vivo difference spectra of
etiolated seedlings computed from the absorbance before and after the
intermittent actinic light show certain absorption changes of the
pigment bands involved. Consequently, the mutants showing certain
defects in chlorophyll biogenesis will probably yield approximately
pure spectra of phytochrome phototransformation.<p>

Figure 1: Variable phototransformations after 5 minutes of
intermittent red/far-red light treatment in 3 genotypes (wildtype ch+,
mutant ch2 and im52=V52) of A. thaliana (L.)Heynh. as revealed gy 4
consecutive difference spectra (fr1-d, r1-fr1, fr2-r1, and r2-fr2)<p>

Figure 1 shows evidently the variable behaviour of phototransformation
in the 3 genotypes studied. The difference spectra fr1-d for the
absorption changes of the etiolated seedlings after their treatment
with 5 minutes fr run in parallel for the wildtype ch+ and the mutant
ch2 showing 3 peaks at about lambda = 640, 665, and 730 nm.  In the
variegated mutant im52, however, there are lower and additional peaks.<p>

Following the experimental treatments we can see that the second
difference spectra r1-fr1 are also highly variable for the 3 genotypes
studied. The line ch2 is characterized by one pronounced peak at 730
nm which evidently belongs to the main band of the activated
phytochrome Pfr.  In the wildtype this phototransformation by 5
minutes red light yields two smaller bands of other Pfr-forms at 708
and 726 nm, and furthermore one band at 656 nm, probably
resembling some Pr which has not been transformed.  On the contrary,
the variegated mutant im52 is mainly characterized by one prominent
absorption change at about 680 nm, the probable band of the
chlorophyllide a holochrome (Kranz 1973); three smaller bands are
equal to those of the wildtype. The extremely high production of
chlorophyllide a after the first treatment of the im52 seedlings by
red light is an interesting result, since the plastid differentiation
of this mutant proved to be very sensitive towards high doses of red
light in earlier experiments (Robbelen 1968, Kranz 1977).<p>

After the second activation by far-red light we expect significant
changes of the absorbance in spectral range from 730 nm (Pfr) to 660
nm (Pr).  This is evidently demonstrated by the difference spectra fr2
minus rl of the wildtype ch+ and the mutant ch2.  Prominent peaks are
obtained at 665 nm and minima at 725 nm probably resembling first of
all the absorption changes of the Pfr to Pr transition.  Once more we
can see that the difference spectrum of im52 differs significantly
from those of the other genotypes studied, since this mutant shows
only one flat peak in the absorption region of Pr and two prominent
maxima in the spectral range of Pfr. Furthermore, this difference
spectrum shows an additional peak at 696 to 699 nm which is
obviously related to one of the intermediate forms of the Pr to Pfr
phototransformation as already described by several authors (Kendrick
and Spruit 1974, Mohr 1974).<p>

From the second treatment with red light we expect difference spectra
r2-fr2 similar to those of r1 minus fr1.  This is true of the mutant
ch2 only. The wildtype ch+, however, shows a single peak at 718 nm
instead of two which have been obtained after the first treatment with
red light in this main region of Pfr absorbance, further, the peak of
chlorophyllide absorption 678 nm now appears. Again we can
distinguish the difference spectrum of im52 (r2-fr2) from the spectra
of the other genotypes but also from its spectrum r1-fr1.  Mainly the
prominent peak of the chlorophyllide has not been formed gain,
although there is a smaller peak at 682 nm which probably belongs
to some transformed chlorophyllide.<p>

Discussion<p>

One way to avoid chlorophyll interference in phytochrome measurements
may be the destruction of chlorophyll or the stopping of its synthesis
by heat (35*degrees*C) or ethanol 3 p.c.) treatment (Grill, 1977).
However, the consequences of such drastic operations in the structure
and function of the membrane systems are unknown.  Therefore, the in
vivo study of etiolated seedlings of mutant genotypes which are partly
or entirely deficient in chlorophyll offers new and better approaches
to test the variability of the phytochrome system in higher plants.<p>

Now, we may conclude from the data presented above:
Phototransformation of the phytochrome system has been stabilized in
ch2 during consecutive r/fr-treatment; although, after the first
fr-treatment most of this pigment was in the photomorphogenetic
effective form Pfr.  This is true also for the wildtype, however, its
phototransformation of Pr to Pfr is blocked to a certain extent as it
was shown by the difference spectra r1 minus fr1, r2 minus fr2, and by
earlier experimental data (Kranz 2976).  Further, the gene controlled
red sensitivity of the variegated mutant im 52 yielded an abnormal,
peculiar output of chlorophyllide after the first treatment with red
light, and relatively weak phytochrome phototransformations in both
directions (Pr &lt;-&gt; Pfr).  How, we suggest from such unusual responses to
r/fr-light that the rate of phytochrome synthesis (Ptot) as well as
the rate of Pr &lt;-&gt; Pfr phototransformations are abnormal in these
defective genotypes yielding ratios which differ from the postulated
value of Pfr/Ptot ~ 0.80 and of Pr/Ptot ~ 0.975; the last ratio
deviates in the mutant im52 only. This supposition is confirmed by
data of earlier experiments (TAble 1) which have shown that in ch+ the
relative amount of Pfr cannot be increased to Pfr/Ptot &gt;/= 0.5 even if
the intensity and the duration of the actinic light is raised to one
minute of 3.0 S.m-2 resulting in higher values of Ptot.<p>

of A. thaliana (L.) Heynh. computed from spectrophotometric
measurements at constant wavelength of *lambda* = 660, 730 and 800 nm.<p>

Finally, we must point out that there is no functional correlation
between the chlorophyll defect and the defective phytochrome system,
since this pigment system transforms and functions normal in the
yellow green mutant ch2, but in the dark green wildtype ch+ certain
phototransformations and photomorphogenetic responses as mentioned
above are abnormal; and, last not least, functional independent
defects of both pigment systems are probably realized in the
variegated im52.  Since this mutant line is characterized by an
abnormal enzyme regulation of the de novo pyrimidine pathway or RNA
degradation (Redei 1975) as well as an unusual red light sensitivity
of its plastid differentiation (Robbelen 1968), now, further studies
of which preliminary results are presented in a second contribution of
this volume (Kranz 1977) will explain possible variations in the
photomorphogenetic effects of those defective sensor pigment systems
in relation to differential gene expression.<p>
