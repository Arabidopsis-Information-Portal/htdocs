BACKGROUND<p>

For Biostack experiments on the biological effect of cosmic radiation
during space flight (Bucker et al., 1978, 1981) qualification tests
were further improved with respect to the selection of suitable
genotypes, proof of seed fixation and compatability to variant
physical nuclear track detectors as well as irradiation of heavy ions
of high atomic number and energetic valocity (HZE) produced by
powerful accelerators (Unilac of GSI, Darmstadt).<p>

This study reports on additional results obtained mainly with respect
to the selection of biological criteria for radiation damage in M1
generation and their relevance for evaluating the designed space
flight experiments (Schott et al., 1983).<p>

METHODS<p>

Presently, energies available at Unilac are limited up to 20 MeV but
the linear HZE-particle fluency can be varied from 10 5 to 5 x 10 8
pcm E-2. For irradiation the gilded sample holder adapted to Unilac
machine (Kraft et al., 1980) was used, where plastic Petri dishes
(diameter, 35 mm) containing the dry detector or wet filter paper with
seeds fixed on the surface were exposed to the beam.<p>

After irradition and dosimetric control of the detector culturing of
irradiated M 1 plants started with aseptic germination and development
on Redei's medium plus 10E-6M IAA until the seedling stage with
vernalization at 2*degrees* C for 48 h and afterwards 25+/- 1*degree*C
with photoperiod of 15L/9D h. Growth continued after transfer of vital
plantlets to standard soil in a green house under nearly the same
environmental conditions. In the radicle test (Muller, 1963) root
length of 7 to 11 days old seedlings was measured with Leitz-orthoplan
microscope improved for micropositioning. Further details of the
material and methods were equal to those previously reported
(Koller-Lampert and Kranz, 1982).<p>

RESULTS<p>

As already obtained for HZE irradiated seeds of Arabidopsis
(Koller-Lampert and Kranz, 1982) decrease of survival in M 1 was
exponential with variant linear reduction in the fluency range of 10 7
to 10 8 pcmE-2 depending on the kind and velocity of the HZE-particle
(Figure 1). For high energetic uranium particles, linear decrease is
steeper at lower fluency rates than for krypton ions which, evidently,
shows that the hit range inside the embryonic seed cells is probably
larger with element of higher atomic number. The particle beam of
lower energy (5.9 MeV/n) doesn't yield significant decrease of
surviving plants because of insufficient particle penetration; for
water, penetration values are as follows: 5.9 MeV/n = 87 micro m for
Kr, 104 micro m for U; 16.2 MeV/n = 270 micro m for Kr, and 270 micro
m for U, respectively. Although fluencies so far obtained for 5.9
MeV/n at Unilac are incomplete for technical reasons, survival of more
sensitive seeds irradiated on wet filter paper with uranium ions at
lower fluencies is not reduced.<p>

triangles = uran (filled = 16.2 MeV/n, open = 5.9 MeV/n), circles =
krypton (filled = 18.0 MeV/n, open = 5.9 MeV/n))<p>

The radicle test, however, shows (Table 1) that with increasing dose
(pcm E-2) the mean length of seedling's root is reduced at high
energetic expositions of uranium particles as well as lower ones of
krypton. This result shows that there must be a stronger effect on the
root growth which is in agreement with earlier findings
(Koller-Lampert and Kranz, 1982) since the apical meristem of the
radicle is not so deeply located inside the seed; thus, the particle
penetration may be sufficient in this case. The last interpretation is
supported by the significantly stronger root length reduction per dose
of high energetic uranium particles (t-test for 5 x 10 10 6 pcm E-2,
*alpha* &lt;/= .01).<p>

fluencies and energies (radicle-length mm)<p>

Further morphological and physiological characters of subsequent
developnment of M 1 plants (frequency of multicaulus and dwarf plants)
were also affected significantly by doses above 10 6 pcmE-2 (Table 2).
However, increase of frequencies with higher particle fluxes is
inconstant which is caused by variant mortality of seedlings.<p>

Seedlings evidently hit by HZE particles (U 16 MeV/n and Ar 728 MeV/n)
showed drastic defects of tissue damage and tumours, an effect which
was firstly reported by Hirono et al. (1968) for carbon ions.<p>

CONCLUSION<p>

Estimation of the number of particles per hit under variant HZE
fluences yield the critical range above 10 6 pcmE-2 which is equal to
one or more hits per meristem cell of the embryo. This estimation
indicates that the cross section of the primary HZE-effect is of the
range of ~200 microm 2. Preliminary results of HZE experiments with
ascospores of Sordaria fimicola confirm this range of cross section
(Kranz, 1983). However, in dry diploid yeast cells there was no
unequivocal dependence of mutation induction cross section on linear
energy transfer (LET), but also a prominent influence of ion specific
energy (Kiefer et al., 1982). This was explained by the action of long
ranging o-electrons, although the range of most energetic o-rays is
estimated to be 1 micro m for specific ion energies of 3.5 MeV/n. In
this case we may conclude that the cross sections of inactivation
reported are larger than the o-range. "The estimated cross section
therefore could depend on target structure rather than on bullet size"
(Schopfer et al., 1980).<p>

The plant system of dry Arabidopsis seeds offers the advantage to
study the biological effect of heavy ions on variant nuclear track
detectors under conditions of accelerator as well as space flight
experiments in order to assess the role of cellular recovery and
genetic repair, respectively damage and mutation in a multicellular,
eukaryotic organism.<p>
