<h2> Leaf colour mutants in Arabidopsis induced by gamma-irradiation of dormant seeds</h2><p>

In this brief note some data are presented on the pattern of
segregation of cotyledon colour (chlorophyll-) mutants in M2- and
M3-progenies of A. thaliana (L.) HEYNH., race En-1, after irradiation
of dormant seeds with 60 Co gamma-rays (dose rate about 3.7 kr/min,
doses = 0, 10, 20, 40, 70, and 110 kr, respectively).  M1 to M3
seedlings and plants were grown on mineral agar medium either on Petri
dishes or in test tubes.<p>

The majority of the cotyledon colour mutants of Arabidopsis are early
recessive lethals. Therefore the procedure of detection of induced
mutants includes three consecutive steps: (1) testing M2-families for
segregation, (2) raising phenotypically normal sibs from segregating
M2-families to seed setting, and (3) checking the latter in M3 for
hetrozygosity. According to LANGRIDGE (1958) and LI and REDEI (1969)
the following segregation ratios are expected in Arabidopsis at these
steps: 7 to 1 of normals to mutants in segregating M2-families, 5:2 of
normal homozygotes to hetrozygotes among phenotypically normal sibs in
segregating M2-families, and 3:1 of normals to mutants in M3-families
obtained from M2-heterozygotes.<p>

In the present study the following mutant phenotypes were
distinguished: white (alb), pale yellow to yellow (xa), yellow-green
(ch) and pale green (vi).  All the alb and xa M2-seedlings were proven
by M3 data to be true mutations, while about a half of ch and vi
seedlings was comprised by a dose-independent admixture of
non-heritable phenocopies. The M2 and M3 segregation data for proven
mutations are presented in Table 1 and 2.<p>

Table 1: Segregation ratios in M2 after different doses of 60Co
gamma-irradiation<p>

The overall M2 segregation ratio of normals to mutants (Table 1) was
found to be in good agreement with a 7:1 expectation (P=0.10 - 0.25)
and showed no dose-dependent trend, in spite of excessive variance
between the different dose-levels (P = 0.005 - 0.010), the latter
being apparently due to the limited material available.  On the other
hand, distinct differences were observed (Table 2) between M2
segregation ratios for the four types of mutations scored (P = 0.001 -
0.005), and a significant correlation was found between segregation
ratio and germination rate in segregating the M2-families studied (rS
= 0.43; P = 0.01 - 0.05).<p>

Table 2: Segregation ratios for different chlorophyll mutants in M2
and M3 after 60Co gamma-irradiation<p>

The overall M2 segregation ratio of normal homozygotes to hetrozygotes
was found to be 240:83 or 5.8:2, which is in agreement with a 5:2
expectation (P = 0.25).  Due to limited material available a detailed
analysis of these data by dose-levels or mutation-types seems to be
unreasonable.<p>

The overall M3 segregation ratio of normals to mutants (Table 2) was
found to disagree with the 3:1 expectation (P less than 0.001) with
distinct differences between mutations (P less than 0.001). The
observed mutant deficit may be caused (at least, partially) by a
poorer germination in M3 as compared to M2 (85 and 97%, respectively).
However, no correlation was found between segregation and germination
in M3 (rS = 0.15; P more than 0.05).  As a reason for the absence of
such correlation (contrary to M2) a relatively high contribution of
"physiological" disturbances in M3 germination (masking the genetical
effects on the latter) may be suggested.  It therefore appears that to
obtain reliable segregation data an excellent germinability of the
seeds is required.<p>
