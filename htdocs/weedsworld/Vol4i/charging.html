<h3>Stock Centres obtain further funding</h3>
	  <p>We are pleased to announce that, based on the success of
	  the last five years, the Stock Centres have now officially
	  received funding to continue to provide seed, DNA and
	  information resources.  The Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock
	  Centre (NASC) and the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center
	  (ABRC) have received five-year and four-year funding from
	  the BBSRC and NSF, respectively.  Together with the funds
	  raised from user fees, we will be able to continue the
	  expansion of our collections to meet the needs of the
	  research programme.</p>

<h3>Introduction of user fees</h3>
	  <p>As part of our renewed funding programme and as announced
	  on the Arabidopsis newsgroup, from April 1, 1997, ABRC and
	  NASC have implemented a user fee system.  Some user fees
	  were necessary to allow us to keep pace with the demand for
	  services in the current grant funding climate.  The user
	  system involves "general" fees, which are annual fees
	  covering different range of usages for individual seed and
	  DNA stocks plus a few individual charges for seed stocks
	  such as sets of T-DNA lines and DNA stocks such as library
	  filters.</p>

	  <p>The user fee system was design to be simple to deal with,
	  fair to all users and minimize associated paperwork.  The
	  fees of ABRC and NASC are coordinated, and we expect to be
	  cooperating in this effort, as in the past, to minimize the
	  overall effort associated with Arabidopsis stock curation
	  and distribution.  We hope that enough funds will be raised
	  to cover the continually increasing demand for our stocks
	  and allow the necessary increase of effort required to
	  handle increased numbers of stocks such as larger
	  collections of T-DNA lines, new mutant stocks and BAC
	  clones.
</p>
	  <p>The text of the sections describing the justification and
	  detail of charging from the original newsgroup annoucement
	  on charging are reprinted below.  If you have any questions
	  feel free to contact us.
</p>
  

<h3>Partial Text of the  Newsgroup Announcement on User Fees</h3>

 
<p>The Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC) and the
      Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC) have been providing
      stocks to researchers for over five years, subsidized by the NSF
      in the U.S and the BBSRC in the U.K.  It was the initial policy
      of both centers to provide resources to all users free of
      charge.  This policy has served Arabidopsis research well and
      fostered the development of major research activity. Funding
      constraints in both the U.S. and U.K. combined with the
      continually increasing variety of and demand for stocks have
      resulted in a gap between the funds available and those needed
      to provide these services. Hence, both the NASC and ABRC
      advisory committees concluded to best serve Arabidopsis research
      in the future, user fees should be instituted.  Below, we
      outline the benefits and details of the new user fee system.</p>

<H3>Why user fees are now necessary</H3>

<P>The stock centers were initially established to preserve seed and
DNA stocks of Arabidopsis and to distribute these to anyone interested
in using these for research.  It was envisaged that mutant lines,
ecotypes, clones of individual genes and YAC and phage libraries would
be received and distributed.  The budgets for the first five years of
both centers were developed on these bases.  All of the initially
proposed seed items have been incorporated into the NASC and ABRC
collections.  In addition, many stocks, not initially existing, also
have been placed into the collections.  Most notable of these are
pooled samples of several thousand T-DNA transformants.  Demand for
all of our stocks has been exceedingly high, resulting in larger than
anticipated supply expenditures.  In spite of this, the centers have
managed to operate within their originally allocated budgets.  </P>

<P>As we plan for the future, it is expected that funding for the Centers
from both U.K and U.S. funding agencies will decrease with time, while
still providing significant financial support.  This is in keeping with
the very tight overall support of research from governments.  However,
demand for current stocks is still increasing, and there are many new
stocks which clearly should be incorporated into our collections and
distributed.  The potential new stocks include vastly increased
holdings of T-DNA and transposon lines, more large-insert libraries
(probably including those that will be associated with the Arabidopsis
sequencing project) and pooled DNAs for PCR probing of both of the
above resources.
</P> 
<P>It has been agreed by the Advisory Committees of both centers to
initiate some user fees.  It is felt that the fee schedules outlined in
the following section can accomplish all of the above goals.  We hope
that you will find the fees modest and not onerous.  The anticipated
revenues from the user fees will account for less than
20% of the total (direct plus indirect) support of either center from
outside sources.  Also, the stocks centers will not in any case realize
profits on any stocks.  Rather the fees recover some of our handling
and materials costs.
</P>

<H3>Details of the charging system</H3>
<P>The charging policies of the Arabidopsis centers are designed to raise
some necessary operating funds while adhering to the following
principles: 
<ol>
	    <li>Keep costs to users as low as possible;</li>

	    <li>Minimize paperwork for users and the centers</li>
	    
<li>Charge as equitably as possible relative to individual usage
while keeping the pricing structure simple</li>
	  </ol>
</P>

<P>Based on the above criteria, the charging policy is as follows:</p>

<p> Annual <b>"general"</b> fees based on usage levels will be
collected from each laboratory ordering stocks from a stock center.
Also, some large groups of seed stocks and major DNA stocks will have
individual fees.  The usage levels determining the general fees are:
</P>

<OL> <p> <LI> <b>Occasional users</b>.  Users ordering 10 or fewer
individual stocks in a single order per year will be considered
"occasional" users and will not be asked to pay a general fee.  These
stocks will be provided free of charge.
 </p>

<p><LI> <b>Small quantity users.</b> If a laboratory orders 11 stocks
from NASC but does not exceed 100 stocks, then they are considered a
small quantity user. For orders from the ABRC, a small quantity user
will be someone who orders more than 11 but less than 101 stocks in
either the seed or DNA category.  Here, the classification is not
based on the sum of seed and DNA stocks ordered, but rather on the
larger order total of the two.</p>
 
 
	<LI> <b>Large quantity users.</b>  If a laboratory orders from NASC at least 101 but does
not exceed 200 stocks, then they are a large quantity user. Similarly, if a laboratory orders at least 101 from ABRC but does
not exceed 200 stocks  in either the seed or DNA category, it
is a large quantity user (with the higher of the two classifications
determining the usage level).  
</OL> 
 
<P>For laboratories exceeding the 200-stock limit, proportional additional
fees will be requested.
</P> 
 
<P> European users are expected to order and pay general fees through
NASC and North American users are expected to order from and pay
general fees to ABRC.  Laboratories in other locations may establish
their primary affiliation with either center.  Users will need only to
pay the annual fee to one centre for seeds.  If it becomes necessary
to order from the second centre, there will be no additional charge.
In such cases, the total number of stocks ordered at both centres will
determine the general fee category.  However, DNA-only supplemental
general affiliations to ABRC are available to NASC subscribers at 1/2
the regular rates.  In no case will double (full) fees to ABRC and
NASC be charged.  The pricing/fee structure for current stocks is
outlined below: </P>

</CENTER>

<P>The current stocks for which individual charges will be assessed are
sets of T-DNA pools, recombinant inbred sets, large-insert libraries
and filters, pooled DNA from large-insert libraries and pooled DNA from
T-DNA lines.  The cost of these will be essentially proportional to the
number of stocks in the group.  Ordering of these stocks does not
require a general fee nor contribute to a laboratory's user size
classification.
</P> 
 
<P>Shipping costs will be added to the invoice for all orders requiring
special handling.
</P>

<H3>Invoicing information</H3>

<P>The charging system was introduced on April 1, 1997.  From this
date, you simply order stocks as previously, and we will send an
invoice along with your stocks when you have qualified for a usage
level and/or for stocks which have specific associated costs.  Please
be sure to include the name of the person in charge of the laboratory
on all orders, since we must have this information to process the
order.  The period to which the first annual fee applies will extend
through until April 30, 1998 ie an extra month for this first year.
All questions regarding invoices should be directed to the appropriate 
stock center.

</P>
<P>Payments to the ABRC should be made by cheque to The Ohio State
University in U.S.  Dollars and for NASC the cheque should be made
payable in Pounds Sterling to the University of Nottingham.  Note that
for certain European Community countries a 17.5% Value Added Tax (VAT)
will be added for NASC orders.  The general fees cover all individuals
working in a single laboratory.
</P>

 
<P><b>NOTE</b>, that for any laboratory which needs a particular
stock(s) but which cannot afford the associated charge, we will
send the stock free of charge.  </P>

 
<P>Our primary goal remains to serve Arabidopsis researchers, and the
funds generated by this system will allow us to serve you even better.
Feel free to contact either NASC or ABRC if you have questions or
comments regarding this policy.  Since this represents a new dimension
to our operations, we hope that you will be understanding as we
implement this system.  We encourage any comments or suggestions you
may have regarding these charges.  We are certain that improvements can
be made as we gain experience.
