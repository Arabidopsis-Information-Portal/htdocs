The procedure of measuring adaptive values of A. thaliana genotypes in
experimental populations carrying two alleles of the same locus and
three corresponding genotypes (Svobodova and Cetl, 1977) enabled us to
focus our attention on the inter relation of the two components of the
adaptive value. For this purpose, indexes of relative viability (v1,
v2) were put against those of relative fertility (f1, f2) in the two
homozygotes, +/+ and m/m, respectively (Figure 1, open circles). At
the same time, corresponding correlation coefficients (r) and the two
regression coefficients (bf and bv) were calculated with their
standard errors (s.e.). When analogous data of Cetl and Plchova,
(1975) were included (black circles) the picture did not change. No
statistically significant difference of the correlation and regression
coefficients from O was found. Thus the viability and fertility
components of the adaptive value seem to be independent in the
material studied.<p>

No similar data in literature are available except for those by
Allard, Kahler and Clegg (1977) who found that viability and fertility
selection operated in opposite direction (pg 16). Such a case would be
proved by means of negative correlation a regression between viability
and fertility indexes. A third type of relation between the two
components of adaptive value when viabiity and fertility selection
operate in the same direction and correlation and regression are
positive would be theoretically possible next to the two preceding
types.<p>

the adaptive value (v1, v2 and f1, f2, respectively) in the two
homozygotes (+/+ and m/m).<p>

The approach given represents an adequate basis in search for the
occurrence of the three possibilities under different genetic and
environmental situations.<p>
