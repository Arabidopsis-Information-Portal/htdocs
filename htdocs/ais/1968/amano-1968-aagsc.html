<h2>Photoreactivation of UV-irradiated roots of Arabidopsis thaliana</h2><p>

The recovery from irradiation with ultraviolet light (UV) by
posttratment with visible ight was tested.  Because of the weak
penetrability of the UV it was intended to take advantage of the thin
root of the Arabidopsis seedling for studying photoractivation in a
higher plant.  Measurements were taken of the linear growth of the
primary root after the UV irradiation.<p>

The used seeds were a 1967 harvest of the strain "Estland" obtained
from the Brookhaven National Laboratory, U.S.A. through Drs.  A.H.
SPARROW (BNL), K. YAMAKAWA (IRB) and T. FUJII (NIG).  Seeds were
surface-disinfected in 95% ethanol and 3% H202 (1:1) for 5 min at room
temperature, rinsed twice with sterilized water, and sown on 0.8% or
1.0% agar in 9 cm Petri dishes. A pipette was found convenient, as
suggested by VELEMINSKY and GICHNER in this newsletter, for placing
the seeds on the agar media in lines. Then the dishes were stored in a
refrigerator for 24 hours at 3 - 5*degrees*C.  After this cold
treatment, the dishes were stacked together and placed on a support so
that the agar plates were held vertically with seeds lined up
horizontally, under the illumination of a 400W high pressure mercury
fluorescent lamp (3,000 lux) at 20 - 25*degrees*C.  Several layers of
glass (Petri dish walls etc.) were sufficient to filter out the
harmful UV component of this light source.  After germination the
roots of the seedlings grew on the surface of the agar straight
downward. When they were about 5mm long, they were irradiated with UV
from four 4W germicidal lamps, at an intensity of 200 ergs/mm2/sec as
measured by a Toshiba germicidal light meter.  Luminescence from the
germicidal lamps was light enough that no safety light was used.  One
group of the UV-irradiated plates remained in the dark room where the
UV treatments were done. The other group was posttreated with visible
light by continuing the culture under the first type of illuination.
After these treatments, the dishes were again placed vertically, but
with 90*degrees* rotated, so that the roots grew downward in a right
angle to the parts grown before the treatment. The length of this
second growth was measured through the bottom of the dish uder a 10x
binocular microscope with a micrometer.<p>

Table : Photoractivation of UV-irradiated primary roots of Arabidopsis
thaliana seedlings<p>

As shown in the table, in most of the experiments photoreactivation of
root growth was detected, though the degree of the reactivation was
not large. Some of the experiments were disturbed by the retardation
of the root growth in consequence of the dark treatment. This
interaction may be one of the reasons that the photoreactivation
effect in our experiments was not as significant as in microorganisms
(KELNER 1949).  The use of root growth might be another ane probably
the main cause of the smallness of the detected photoreactivation.
Less- or non-damaged cells can compensate the UV damage in terms of
root length. This is the more likely as almost normal growth was
regained after the temporary delay and the initial morphological
reaction of UV irradiated roots. Therefore, cytological methods must
be tried to confirm and further analyze photoreactivation in
Arabidopsis.<p>
