<h2>Uniform cultures in soil:  a comment</h2><p>

	In systematic methodological experiments with race Li-2, CONTANT (1966a) has, with respect to optimal germination procedures, confirmed our conclusions from experiments on a collection of races (VAN DER VEEN, 1965).  However, instead of transplanting from the agar to the greenhouse very young seedlings with etiolated cotyledons (due to 48 hrs dark after 24 hrs light), CONTANT (1966b) prefers to transplant older non-etiolated seedlings (7 days old).  This procedure is simpler and he is right in saying that the dark period may considerably weaken seedlings after different kinds of irradiation and that irregular (increased range of) germination, i.e., radiation induced, interferes with accurate timing of the beginning of the dark period.  To our experience with non-mutagen-treated material, transplanting after 7 days-on-agar gives a pronounced increase in variance of, e.g., flowering time, and therefore we prefer to transplant younger seedlings.  However, Dr. FEENSTRA in this Department, has very good results with transplanting 7 day old seedlings grown on perlite and into soil imbibing water from below (see elsewhere in this issue).<p>

	Additional data are given here on etiolation after mutagen treatment (though not applied with the aim of studying early somatic effects).<p>

	(1) From wet seeds of Landsberg- 'erecta', X-rayed with up to 16 kR, seedlings recover very well during the 2 or 3 days light between the dark period and transplanting.  Seeds pretreated for 5 days at 10*degrees8C (to break dormancy) and X-rayed immediately after assuming room temperature are first given 24 hrs light as usual.  Non-dormany dry seeds first imbibe for 24 hrs under light, and after X-raying are directly transferred to the dark.<p>

	(2)  EMS treatment (in the dark) of dry seeds or of seeds dried after cold treatment, induces germination delay but not irregular germination. Thus, cumulative germination curves based on hour to hour scorings run parallel.  With, e.g., 10 mM, 24 hrs, 24*degrees*C, the points of 20%, 50%, and 80%, germination all show a delay of about 8 hours as compared with the control  Therefore, prior to etiolation, EMS treated seeds are given 24 + 8 hrs light.  After etiolation, the 2 or 3 days light give good recovery.<p>

	A final comment refers to LAWRENCE (1966) who puts pre-imbibed seeds directly on soil by means of a fine point brush.  This is perhaps the most time-saving method.  However, to our experience, in a greenhouse densely occupied with Arabidopsis experiments in all stages of plant development, it proved more or less to our surprise virtually impossible to avoid stray seeds, which can be a source of confusion. This, in fact, was one of our arguments for adopting the transplanting technique. Stray seedlings following-up can then be easily spotted.<p>
