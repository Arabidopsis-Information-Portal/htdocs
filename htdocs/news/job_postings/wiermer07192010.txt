PhD position 
 
in-plant disease resistance signaling 
 
 
at the Department of Plant Cell Biology, Albrecht-von-Haller Institute for Plant Sciences, 
University of Göttingen Germany 

A PhD position is available from October 15, 2010 in the laboratory of Marcel Wiermer to 
investigate molecular mechanisms regulating spatial communication between the cytoplasm 
and the nucleus during plant immune responses against microbial pathogens, using 
Arabidopsis as model organism. The position is offered for a period of three years according 
to TV-L 13 (50 %, PhD) on the German pay scale. The candidate will join our ongoing 
research to explore the function of identified components of the nucleocytoplasmic 
trafficking machinery with regard to their regulatory function in plant defense signal 
transduction. Our studies further include in planta affinity purification approaches, yeast 
two-hybrid analyses, forward and reverse genetics to identify novel biochemical and genetic 
interactors that will be characterized at the molecular level. 
 
Informal enquiries about the position are encouraged via wiermer@uni-goettingen.de. 
 
Applicants should submit a cover letter, CV, a brief statement of research experience, and 
contact information for two references, preferentially via e-mail to Marcel Wiermer at 
wiermer@uni-goettingen.de or by mail to Marcel Wiermer, Georg-August-University 
Goettingen, Albrecht-von-Haller-Institute for Plant Sciences, Dept. Plant Cell Biology, Untere 
Karspuele 2, D-37073 Goettingen, Germany. Closing date for applications is August 31, 2010. 
 
We explicitly welcome applications from abroad. The University of Göttingen is an equal 
opportunities employer and places particular emphasis on fostering career opportunities for 
female scientists and scholars. Qualified women are therefore strongly encouraged to apply. 
Disabled persons with equivalent aptitude for the position will be favoured.
