In some experiments performed last year, there were indications that
plants in test tubes with elastic foam plugs* grew better than those
in tubes with cotton plugs.<p>

*The source of the elastic foam plugs is: Gaymar Industries, 701
Seneca, Buffalo, New York<p>

A randomized experiment was carried out to test the effect of plugs.
Five treatments were used: (1) foam plugs only, (2) cotton plugs only,
(3) foam plugs and aluminum foil caps, (4) cotton plugs and aluminum
foil caps, and (5) aluminum foil caps only.  For each treatment, 100
plants were seeded in 150 mm tubes on mineral medium and glucose and
placed in a growth chamber under constant light and 21*degrees*C
constant temperature.<p>

Table 1: Days to maturity for the Estland variety under constant light
and at 21*degrees*C has not been tested is that the exchange of oxygen
and CO2 might be freer with foam plugs than with cotton plugs.  This
idea is supported because aluminum foil caps considerbly delayed
maturity.<p>
