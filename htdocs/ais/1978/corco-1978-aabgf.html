For the same reasons that Arabidopsis thaliana has been a successful
organism in the study of plant genetics and plant physiology we
believe that it would be a good model to study plant diseases. We
selected crown gall since this is an important disease causing tumors
in many plants.<p>

Contrary to the results obtained by De Cleene and De Ley (1976), we
did not obtain a mass of small warty tumors, but a systematic
infection.<p>

Three week-old plants grown in test tubes under direct light at
24*degrees*C, were inocculated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens. A
needle with the inocculum was inserted directly into the stem of the
tratem plants. The plants turned brown within 7 days. The affected
plants absorbed water very rapidly from the agar indicating increased
respiration and/or transpiration. The controlled plants into which a
needle with sterile water had been inserted were unaffected.<p>

Agrobacterium tumefaciens was recovered from the leaves, stems, and
flowers of the affected plants, confirming that there was a systematic
infection by the crown gall organism.<p>
