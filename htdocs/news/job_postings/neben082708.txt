Postdoctoral Position in Molecular Cell Biology 
 
A NSF-funded postdoctoral position is available immediately to investigate protein-
protein interactions involved in motor attachment to organelles in plant cells. The 
successful candidate will employ both affinity purification of protein complexes and 
yeast two-hybrid screens to identify proteins interacting with myosin motor proteins. 
Prior experience with these techniques is a plus but not required. This project is part of a 
larger effort to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying organelle movements and 
cytoplasmic streaming in plant cells. More information on our research can be found on 
our lab web site at http://www.bio.utk.edu/cellbiol . 
A Ph.D. in molecular biology, biochemistry, cell biology, or a related discipline is 
required. Expertise in plant molecular biology, biochemistry, and protein purification is 
highly desirable.
