Two series of experiments have been performed on the combined effets
of the ruby laser (lamba = 6943 angstrom, tau = 10**8 sec.) and
x-ray-irradiation.<p>

Variants of the experiments:<p>

1.  X-ray-irradiation, the dose 40 kr, 20 kr.<p>

2.  Ruby laser, density of the irradiation P=7 J/cm2, 5 J/cm2<p>

3.  Laser + x-ray-irradiation<p>

4.  X-ray-irradiation + laser<p>

In the two series of irradiation the capacities of the
x-ray-irradiation were different.  The following parameters have been
estimated: The survival by the end of the vegetation; depression of
the first rootlets on the 8th day of growing in agar medium.<p>

As shown in Figure 1, no additivity has been obsrved in the variants
"x-ray + laser" and "laser + x".  The effect of the depression of all
the parameters in the variant "x-ray + laser" was higher, than in
"laser + x-ray" variant under the same doses of x-ray-irradition and
density of the laser iradiation.<p>

Figure 1: The survival and suppression of growth of the firt rootlets
in percent to control after the combined x-ray-ruby-laser irradiation
of A. thaliana seeds.<p>

This fact might probably be explained by investigating the
interactions between the laser irradiation and free radicals formed by
the x-ray-irradiation.<p>

The authors are indebted to Dr. L.B. RUBIN for the cooperation in
irradiation of the seed material.<p>
