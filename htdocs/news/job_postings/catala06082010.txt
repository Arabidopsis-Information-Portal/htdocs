Postdoctoral Associate in Hormonal Regulation of Tomato Fruit Development

A postdoctoral position is available at the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research in the 
Cornell University campus, Ithaca, New York, in the area of hormonal regulation of tomato fruit 
development. The overall goal of the project is to study the role of genes that mediate the action,
transport or synthesis of auxin in the control of fruit growth and shape Experimental approaches 
will include the use of laser capture microdissection of specific fruit tissues to isolate RNA for 
transcript profiling using the Illumina technology, integration of transcript and hormone profile 
data, in situ hybridization and transgenic plant analysis. This research is part of a NSF Plant 
Genome Project to study genes and networks regulating fruit morphology.

Requirements
A Ph.D. and demonstrated experience and expertise in plant molecular biology and plant physiology 
are essential. A background in plant hormone analysis would be advantageous. Candidates must have 
strong written and oral communication skills.
This position is offered for one year with possibility of extension.

To Apply
Please send curriculum vitae, a short statement of research interests and the names and contact 
information of three referees to Dr. Carmen Catal√° (cc283@cornell.edu). Review of applications
will begin immediately, and continue until position is filled.

BTI is an equal opportunity, affirmative action educator and employer.
