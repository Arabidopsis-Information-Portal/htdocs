To solve certain scientific quetions a vegetative reproduction of
Arabidopsis plants would be very useful.  For example, it could be
possible to preserve sterile mutations or detect somatic ones.<p>

NAPP-ZINN et al., were anxious to cultivate cuttings of Arabidopsis
leaves.  They succeed in rooting a grat lot of these leaves,
especially by high light intensity and treatment with suxine (0.2 ppm
NAA).  But upto present they failed to induce shoot buds on the leaf
cuttings. hus the aim of their endeavour, the formation of a
clone, could not be achieved.<p>

We tried therefore, another way to solve this problem.  We cultivated
Arabidopsis plants (race ENKHEIM) under optimal conditions
(18*degrees*C and greater than or equal to 12 h artificial light per day) in a mixture of
compost and sand (1:1) in small pots. After development of the main
influorescence the vigorous plants were brought under short day
conditions.  Consequently the flower buds turned back into the
vegetative phase and each flower started forming a small leaf rosette
(see Figure).  Such rosettes were detached carefully and planted in
soil where they rooted after a short time.  After transfer into long
day conditions they formed normal influorescences.  The same
photoperiodic treatment is effective with flower buds of shoots coming
out of the axils of the rosette leaves.<p>
