My lab studies the switch to flower formation in Arabidopsis as well as chromatin-mediated control of developmentally 
appropriate gene expression. In eukaryotes, genomic DNA is highly compacted in the nucleus. This compaction renders 
portions of the genomic DNA inaccessible to transcription factors or the general transcriptional machinery. A large 
fraction of the inaccessible DNA consists of gene-poor heterochromatin. Portions of the gene-rich euchromatin are also 
inaccessible or silenced. A hallmark of this silencing is that it occurs only in certain conditions, for example in 
some cell types or in the absence of an environmental cue. In multicellular eukaryotes, euchromatic silencing is 
largely mediated by Polycomb repression. Polycomb repressors do not have inherent sequence specificity, they need to 
be targeted to the correct genomic loci. We are seeking a talented your postdoc to join our lab to address how these 
chromatin regulators are recruited to the genomic DNA to prevent precocious flower formation. The ideal candidate 
would have experience in both molecular biology and computational biology, however well qualified individuals that 
have experience in developmental biology and molecular biology are also encouraged to apply. Please send your CV and 
a list of three references by e-mail to wagnerdo@sas.upenn.edu.
