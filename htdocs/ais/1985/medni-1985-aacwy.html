INTRODUCTION<p>

At present two hypotheses exist considering the influence of mutant
treatment of seeds on a number of initial cells of a generative embryo
system (IC): a) the number of IC falls with the increase of mutagen
dose; b) the number of IC on an averge is constant and does not depend
on the mutagen treatment. The true answer is important, in particular,
for the interpretation of the experimental mutagenesis data, but the
investigators don't have yet one opinion on this aspect (Shevchenko
and Grinikh, 1981):<p>

Our study of the influence of ethyleneimine (EI) on Arabidopsis seeds
showed that under the influence of this mutagen the number of IC can
decrease 2, 5-3 times; neglecting this aspect leads to substantial
artefacts when constructing the "dose-effect" cure and estimating the
mutagen effectiveness (Mednik and Usmanov, 1982). But these data are
received only for one mutagen; moreover, EI is known to cause delayed
mutagenesis (Auerbach, 1978), and it may lead to overestimation of the
observed IC number and, in principle, to the misrepresentation of
dose-dependence of this value. That is why in this paper we decided to
check the influence of such traditional mutagen as *gamma*rays on the
numnber of IC.<p>

MATERIAL AND METHODS<p>

Air-dry seeds of A. thaliana, race Enkheim, were irradiated at the
*gamma*-device of the Tajik State University with doses from 10 kr to
200 kr at the irradiation power 80p/sec. The next day after
irradiation the seeds were sown on agarized nutritional medium in
Petri dishes. At the stage of 4 rosette leaves the seedlings were
transplanted into pots with soil. Lethal chlorophyll mutations (LChM)
in the first 10 pods were scored by the embryo test. The number of IC
(n) was scored by the formula:<p>

where m a is the fraction of plants in the progeny of which LChM are
detected; m g is the fraction of pods in the progeny of which LChM are
detected.<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

From the data of Table 1 it is clear that the number of IC decreases
with the dose (*chi*sq.5 = 99.4; P&lt;0.001). As in the case with EI
at small doses the mean number of IC approximately = 3.5 and decreases up to 1 at
sublethal doses. It is interesting that at maximum EI doses of our
experiments, the number of IC was more than 1 (n = 1.3); possibly it
points to the fact that EI can cause mutations in subsequent cell
generations and then the observed number of IC may be greater than the
true one. However, the laws of changing the number of IC with dose are
the same in the experiments with *gamma*rays and ethyleneimine (Figure
1). The same can be said about the character of differences between
the values of M and M'.<p>

The increase of the sizes of the mutant sector (i.e., the decrease of
IC) with growing dose of the mutagen when treating seeds was detected
also in barley (Gaul, 1964; Eriksson, 1965), wheat (MOH and Smith,
1951; Damato, 1965) rice (BeKendam, 1961; Yamaguchi, 1962),
Arabidopsis (Muller, 1964). Together with our data (Usmanov et al.,
1980; Mednik and Usmanov, this paper) it suggests the correctness of
the hypothesis on the decrease of the number of IC with the increasing
dose of mutagen.<p>

However, it should be taken into consideration that, apparently, the
lethal effect of the mutagen depends not only on the dose but on the
conditions of growth, that is why one may not detect the decrease of
the number of IC in certain dose intervals. For example, if in this
experiment we restricted the dose from 20 kr to 80 kr then the
observed change of the number of IC from 1.73 up to 1.26 should be
accounted insignificant (*chi*sq5 = 5.7; P&gt;0.05) The differences of
the M and M' values are not significant at doses of 20, 40 and 60
kr. Possibly where the decrease of the number of IC with increasing
dose of the mutagen was not observed, the experimental results are
explained just by the insufficient size of the dose interval. The
established rule on changing the number of IC through the influence of
the mutagen does not touch the mechanism of this phenomenon. It has a
descriptive character, and under such condition it is quite enough for
interpreting the data of experimental mutagenesis. However, the
results from this rule requirement to determine the number of IC at
all doses complicates the use of the m a value (the fraction of plants
segregating mutations in M 2) for the estimation of mutation
frequencies (M). On the other hand, at low and mean mutation
frequencies the estimation of M according to m a leads to the minimum
error (Mednik, 1985, this volume), that is why the fact, that there
are dose intervals where the number of IC is practically constant, is
very important; the experiments, carried out in this interval allow
relatively easily and with maximum exactness to get quantitative
estimates of the induced mutation process.<p>

SUMMARY<p>

The estimation of the number of generative initial cells in the seed
embryo of Arabidopsis thaliana treated with variant doses of
*gamma*rays or ethyleneimine is compared and discussed. An increase of
the size of the mutant tissue sector (i.e., decrase of initial cell
number) with growing dose of the mutagen is confirmed.<p>
