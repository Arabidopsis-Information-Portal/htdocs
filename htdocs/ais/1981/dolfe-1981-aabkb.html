Using starch gel electrophoresis with Tris-citrate pH 7.0 as running
buffer, three tapes of electrophoretic variants of alcohol
dehydrogenase (E.C.1.1.1.1) (ADH) were identified among geographical
races of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. These variants have been
designated S (slow), F (fast) and A (superfast), according to their
electrophoretical mobility with respect to the anode (Jacobs and
Schwartz, 1980). Electrophoretic and genetic studies suggest that, as
mentioned for other plants, the enzyme behaves as a dimer and that a
single genetic locus is present in Arabidopsis thaliana.<p>

In Arabidopsis plants ADH activity is confined to pollen and seeds and
rapidly declines during the germination process. ADH was presented as
one of the major anaerobic stress proteins in maize primary seedling
roots (Sachs et al., 1980). Aerobically grown maize seedling roots
subjected to anaerobic stress periods synthetise a restricted subset
of new proteins, among which ADH is one of the most represented.<p>

In Arabidopsis the occurrence of a high level of ADH activity has been
established in callus and suspension cultures. This report deals
specifically with the characteristics of the induction phenomenon.<p>

Anaerobic treatment of Arabidopsis seedling roots for 24 hours in an
argon atmosphere (Sachs et al., 1978) leads only to a weak increase in
ADH activity, mostly located in the vicinity of the root vascular
bundles, as shown by in situ histochemical staining (Dolferus and
Jacobs, in preparation).<p>

However, during callus induction from seeds or leaf pieces on a PG 2
culture medium (Negrutiu et al., 1975) containing 1 mg/1 2, 4-D, ADH
activity increased markedly. Such ADH induction could also be
demonstrated in suspension cultures. As a matter of fact, ADH activity
appeared as one of the most represented proteins in such conditions on
the basis of the total protein pattern obtained after native-SDS two
dimensional electrophoresis. By using electrophoretic variants, the
ADH spot can be clearly identified on the gel. Seedling extracts do
not give rise to an ADH spot. Such data could be interpreted as
evidence for de novo synthesis of ADH polypeptides during callus
growth. The observed ADH activity was not due to activation of
preexisting, inactive ADH polypeptides.<p>

This ADH induction during callus growth can be accomplished by making
ADH mRNA available to the translation system of the cell. This can
occur by two of the following mechanisms (Ferl et al., 1981):<p>

1. The ADH mRNAs can be synthesized de novo or by processing from a
precursor RNA molecule.<p>

2. ADH messengers can be activated from "sequestered" or "masked"
mRNAs (Jenkins et al., 1978; Giles et al., 1977). The distinction
between induction by de novo synthesis of ADH mRNA or by activation of
preexisting ADH messengers can be made by in vitro translation of
total cellular RNA, obtained from plants or from callus.<p>

As in vitro translation system we used the cell free rabbit
reticulocyte lysate, treated with micrococcal nuclease to digest
endogenous mRNAs (Pelham and Jackson, 1976). Total RNA was extracted
from 10 day old seedlings, grown on PG 0 medium (PG 2 medium without
hormones), and from 35 day old primary calli grown on PG 2 medium.
From this total RNA, the poly(A)+ mRNA fraction, obtained by oligo-dT
cellulose chromatography, was used to stimulate the reticulocyte in
vitro translation system. Typically 1 micro g of mRNA was added to 25
micro l reaction mix with 35S methionine as radioactive amino acid.
Exogenous Arabidopsis RNA caused 10 to 20 fold stimulations of the
system above the background or endogenous incorporation.<p>

Radioactive translation products were separated with two dimensional
electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. Two different two
dimensional electrophoretic systems have been used to separate the
proteins.<p>

Figure 1 a and b show the results obtained with a native SDS two
dimensional electrophoresis system (Ferl et al., 1978). The
translation products from callus mRNA show a distinct ADH spot,
whereas messengers from seedlings could not stimulate the translation
of ADH polypeptides. By applying a mixture of a callus extract and the
reticulocyte lysate to the gel, we were able to find the ADH spot on
the autoradiogram by direct superposition with the protein pattern of
the gel.<p>

Confirmation of this result was obtained by using a reverse two
dimensional O'Farrell system (O'Farrell, 1975), consisting of a SDS
electrophoresis in the first dimension and an isoelectric focusing
(IEF) in a polyacrylamide gel with 8 M ureum in the second dimension.
Such technique allows the renaturation of the ADH polypeptides to an
active anzyme, which can be localized on such gels by classical
histochemical staining. The system makes possible to distinguish
between the different electrophoretic charge variants of the ADH
enzyme. Figure 1c and d show the results of an autoradiogram of a
SDS-IEF gel. Again we could not find any radioactive ADH spot on the
autoradiogram obtained with the seedling mRNAs.<p>

products.<p>

Such results clearly suggest that callus induction is acompanied by de
novo synthesis of ADH mRNA, rather than by activation of sequestered
ADH mRNA. The induction of ADH in Arabidopsis tissue culture is most
probably due to the presence of the synthetic auxin 2, 4-D (2,
4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) in the culture medium. Properties of
this induction system are presently investigated.<p>
