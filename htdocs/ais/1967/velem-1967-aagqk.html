	Nitrosoamides as well as some other nitroso-compounds are known to be photolabile, e.g., under the action of UV-light they decompose and release nitrous acid (DAIBER and PREUSSMANN, 1964).  This decomposition proceeds also under natural daylight or artificial visible light.<p>

	Seeds of Arabidopsis, race Dijon, were immersed for 24 hours in fresh solutions of l-methyl-l-nitrosourea (MNH) and l-methyl-3-nitro-l-nitrosoguanidine (MNG) in the light and in the dark.  The temperature of treatment (25*degrees*C, the amount of the solution (6 ml), as well as its height and surface was constant for both light and dark treatment.  Fluorescent tubes with the intensity of about 7,000 lux were used as source for artificial light. The results in Table 1 demonstrate that under the influence of light the activity of both mutagens is decreased.  The mutagenic activity, expressed as the frequency of segregating M1 siliques (mb) is lower, and the same is true for the degree of sterility and root length reduction.<p>

Table 1:  The difference between light and dark treatment is higher in the case of MNG.  This is in accordance with the rate and amount of HNO2 release (Table 2).  The amount of nitrous acid in the 0.5 mM MNBG solution reached the concentration of about 0.2 mM already in 8 hours after the onset of light treatment.  The maximal amount of nitrous acid, however, released from 0.5 mM MNH was only 0.1 mM which was reached after 24 hours.<p>

Table 2:  Increase of HN2 (in mM) during the action of light on the solutions of nitrosoamides<p>

	As nitrous acid does not induce any embryonic and chlorophyll lethals in Arabidopsis (MULLER, 1964; and confirmed in our experiments) even at concentrations of 10 mM, it can be assumed that due to the photodecomposition of both nitrosoamides the amount of the active part of the mutagen is lowered.<p>
