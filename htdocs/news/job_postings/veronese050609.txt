PhD position
Umea Plant Science Centre, Sweden
 
Cellulose biosynthesis

We are looking for a PhD student to join our research on plant cell walls. We have 
ongoing research on several novel candidate genes/proteins in the biosynthesis of 
cellulose. In this project you will perform pioneering work to unravel the function and 
biochemistry of these genes/proteins. You will use both Arabidopsis and Poplar as 
model systems. You will have the opportunity to be trained in state-of-the-art 
techniques in Arabidopsis genetics, plant molecular biology, biochemistry, cell wall 
analysis and microscopy, as well as scientific thinking and writing. 

You will be employed as a PhD student for 4 years. You will work in a highly 
stimulating environment at Umeå Plant Science Center (www.upsc.se)-a leading 
research institute in experimental plant biology with a friendly and international 
atmosphere. We have broad expertise in Arabidopsis genetics and wood biology and 
we aim to provide breakthrough knowledge, with possible applications in the forest 
biotechnology sector.

Qualifications: You need a degree in genetics, biochemistry, molecular plant biology 
or equivalent. Knowledge of molecular biology techniques and good English is a 
requirement.

Applications should arrive no later than 2009-05-28. See the following link for
