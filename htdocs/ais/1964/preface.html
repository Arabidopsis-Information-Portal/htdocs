AIS Vol 01:<h2>Robbelen, G.</h2><h2>Preface</h2>

On the occasion of the XI. International Congress of Genetics in
Scheveningen in 1963 an exchange of ideas and information was
initiated among the research workers interested in Arabidopsis.  Since
many valuable and interesting suggestions were forthcoming, it
appeared necessary in the interest of all the research workers, to
give the existing data a systematised and unified expression.  It
should hence be the duty of the Arabidopsis Information Service" to
circulate effectively the available information conducive to
Arabidopsis research.  No prospectus was designed earlier for such a
scientific newsletter.  This issue has therefore been composed merely
on the basis of several contributions kindly sent to the editor by
various research workers.  The present format may however be a
proposal for the future issues.<p>

Needless to mention here the versatility of Arabidopsis in scientific
experiments; readers are referred to the contents and especially to
the bibliography which the editor attempted to compile as complete as
possible.  This wide field of research, for which this "botanical
Drosophila" is so specially suited, should be covered in the
"Arabidopsis Information Service".  Genetics will indeed take the main
part, but notes on ecology, morphology, development, physiology or
biochemistry should as well be appreciated.  The future success and
fate of this initiative endeavour depends upon the aspect of active
cooperation of all those occupied with any Arabidopsis research.<p>

In the first instance the "Arabidopsis Information Service" proposes
to report brief information on the current interests and studies
underway at various research centers.  These informal "Laboratory
Research Communications" (Sect.B) are the most important concern of
the newsletter.  They serve to communicate general inforamtion to all
coworkers and in no case be treated as publications.  Of equal
importance are all suggestions, queries or criticisms, communicated
for consideration or discussion (cf. Sec. D) . This "Correspondence"
demands your active cooperation assistance and maximum attention!

Secondly the "Arabidopsis Information Service" should represent the
central organisation where the addresses of Arabidopsis research
laboratories are registered and recent literature is compiled.  Some
coordination is being attempted in problems such as naming the genes
(cf. p. 38) establishment of stock collections and exchange of
material (cf. p. 37).<p>

Finally the "Arabidopsis Information Service" will publish at request
"Brief Notes" on original observations (cf. Sec. A) not exceeding one
typewritten page.  The manuscripts should be in final shape for
printing and be made as short and clear as possible.  While English
will be the official language, contributions might also be accepted in
German or French, in case lingual difficulties should otherwise
prevent from cooperation.  In order to ensure rapid publication no
proofs can be sent.  While the responsibility for the reported
observations rests with the author, any mistake and error of
composition are the responsibility of the editors.  No reprints can be
supplied.<p>

As the "Arabidopsis Information Service" will be issued yearly, all
contributions and manuscripts should reach the editor not later than
Feb. 1 of each year at the following address:<p>

Gerhard Robbelen, Institut fur Pflanzenbau und Pflanzenzuchtung, 34
Gottingen, von-Siebold-Str. 8, Deutschland

In presenting this first issue it is a pleasure to acknowledge my
indebtedness and gratitude to Professor Arnold Scheibe for his
generous support in many stages of the preparation of this newsletter.
I am especially indebted to Dr. Satya Nirula for reading the
manuscript and to Miss Oda Wolf for preparing the typescript.  But I
would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the many suggestions and
contributions given by all the authors enlisted in the following page.
I wish that the present issue will be a small substitute for their
efforts and a stimulus for further cooperation.<p>

Gerhard Robbelen
