Vol 01:<h2>JACOBS, M.</h2><h2>Studies on the activity and specificity of some chemical mutagens</h2>

EMS is the most efficient mutagen giving 5-10% of chlorophyll
mutations (for 1000 M2 plants).  The effect of different
concentrations has been studied especially by measuring the fertility
of the M1-plants.<p>

MMS at the concentration of 0.2% and 2 hrs treatment is a very poor
mutagen increasing the mutation frequency only to 4-10 times the
spontaneous rate.  Apparently it is, however, not so toxic in M1 as
supposed in literature.<p>

For EMS and MMS different mutation spectra (chlorophyll mutations)
have been recorded; this points towards an alkyl group specificity in
these mutagens.<p>

In preliminary experiments BUDR and IUDR have been shown to be
incorporated into the nucleus and to have mutagenic effects.  New
large scale cultures are in M2 at present.<p>
