Anther culture techniques have been established in many plant species.
The last achievements in anther culture have been reviewed recently by
Maheshwari et al. (1982). Especially in the isolation of mutants with
recessive traits like nitrate reductase deficiency, haploid cells of
plants have been proved to be useful (Widholm, 1983). Muller (1983)
demonstrated that double nitrate reductase deficient mutants could be
isolated from amphihaploid cell cultures of Nicotiana tabacum. The
culture of anthers of Arabidopsis to produce haploid callus and plants
was first accomplished by Gresshoff and Doy (1972). Also Avetisov
(1976), Amos and Scholl (1978), Scholl and Amos (1980), Scholl et al.
(1981) and Keathley and Scholl (1982) have reported the successful
induction of haploid callus and subsequent regeneration of plants from
anther-derived callus in several races of Arabidopsis. No haploid
embroids could be produced directly from anthers.<p>

In our attempts to induce haploid callus from anthers by procedure of
Gresshoff and Doy (1972), almost all anthers did produce callus but
this callus appeared to be diploid. Microscopical observations
revealed that the callus originated from the attachment site of the
detached filaments. About 11,650 anthers from 41 grographic races,
including those that responded positively in experiments by Gresshoff
and Doy (1972) and Amos and Scholl (1978), have been cultured. About
100 anther-derived calli were examined microscopically. Only in three
calli small clusters of cells were observed, which distinguished from
the surrounding tissue. In one of these, derived from an anther of
race Bla-4, the cells could be determined to be haploid. These
clusters disappeared in the course of the anther culture.<p>

To overcome the problem of abundant diploid callus proliferation, a
procedure described by Keller and Armstrong (1979) for Brassica
campestris was adopted to induce direct embryogenesis in anthers. This
procedure involves conditioned cultivation of donor plants, elevated
temperature treatments of excised anthers, and induction of
embryogenesis on a high level of sucrose (10%) followed by cultivation
on a low level of sucrose (2%). About 2,3000 anthers from 4 races and
an F 1-hybrid of Arabidopsis were cultured on the medium of Keller and
Armstrong (1977). Within three weeks buds emerged from some anthers of
the hybrid and of three of the four races used (Table 1).<p>

These buds developed into embroid-like structures (Figure 1). Judging
from Feulgen-stain absorption, which was distinct from cells of the
anther wall, these structures contained young cells. Abundant starch
grains had accumulated in these cells, which interfered with
prochromosome counts. However, in one cell no more than the hyploid
number of prochromosomes could be counted.<p>

sucrose (2%) gives optimal post-induction growth of anther cultures of
B. campestris. Transfer of Arabidopsis anthers to such a medium did
not increase the frequency.<p>

Transfer of anthers of a high (10%) to a low level of sucrose (2%)
gives optimal post-induction growth of anther cultures of B.
campestris. Transfer of Arabidopsis anthers to such a medium did not
increase the frequency of embryonic anthers. After transplantation,
the anthers showed symptoms of early senescence as indicated by
browning. Apparently the very small Arabidopsis anthers had been
damaged upon transplantation and a procedure has to be developed for
more careful transfer.<p>

Of the 3 races showing embryogenic capacity, two had not been tested
earlier by other investigators for haploid callus formation (An-2 and
Bla-4). It is worthwhile to note that race Bla-4 also gave rise to
some haploid callus. Therefore, Bla-4 might be a suitable race in
studies to increase the frequency of embryonic anthers.<p>
