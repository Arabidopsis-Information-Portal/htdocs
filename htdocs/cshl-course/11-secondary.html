<B>INTRODUCTION</B>
<P>
 Thin layer chromatography (TLC) is an indispensible tool for
the analysis of natural products.  It is inexpensive, simple,
and provides relatively high resolution given the sophisitication
of the technique.  LIkewise, radiotracer feeding is very simple
and informative technique for the elucidation of metabolic pathways.
 In the first experiment, we will perform a radiotracer feeding
experiment to determine the metabolic block in the <I>fah1</I>
mutant.  In this experiment <sup>14</sup>C-L-phenylalanine is administered
to excised leaves of Arabidopsis <I>via</I> the transpiration
stream.  Once absorbed by the tissue, a significant proportion
of the <sup>14</sup>C-L-phenylalanine will be channeled into secondary metabolism
by the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia lyase.  Following this deamination
reaction, the metabolites formed from the <sup>14</sup>C-L-phenylalanine
are termed hydroxycinnamic acids, and these metabolites can be
readily separated by TLC.  These radiolabelled metabolites will
be separated by two dimensional TLC, and will be visualized by
their fluorescence, and by autoradiography.  In the second experiment,
we will use TLC to analyze the secondary metabolites of various
Arabidopsis mutants and the hydroxycinnamic acids that are intermediates
in the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway.  Comparison of the
relative mobilities of the radiolabelled spots from experiment
#1 with the mobilities of the hydroxcinnamic acid standards determined
in experiment #2 will permit the identification of most of the
labelled metabolites.<BR>

<P>
<B>Experiment #1: Radiotracer feeding studies<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>Part A: Examination of Sinapic Acid Biosynthesis in the <I>fah1</I>
Mutant<BR>
</B>
<P>
1.  Columbia wild type and <I>fah1-2 </I>mutant plants will be
supplied for this experiment.   Uproot one plant of each genotype.
 It is not necessary to bring the entire root system with the
plant.  Wash off the excess potting mixture in a beaker of deionized
water.  One at a time, transfer the plants to a petri dish containing
sufficient deionized water to cover the roots and the base of
the rosette.  Using a double edged razor blade, excise several
individual leaves from the rosette as close as possible to the
stem.  Transfer each leaf as rapidly as possible to a microfuge
tube containing 1.5 ml of glass distilled water.  Using a Kim
Wipe, carefully blot off any water which clings to the surface
of the leaf.  Watch the leaves carefully for signs of wilting
over the next 30 minutes.  <BR>

<P>
<B>-&gt;</B> When excising leaves, it is very easy for the transpiration
stream to cavitate because the water in the xylem is normally
under significant tension.  When this tension is relieved by cutting
through the petiole, the contents of the xylem tends to &quot;snap
up&quot; towards the leaf.  Leaves in which this occurs rapidly
wilt because it is impossible for the leaf to reestablish the
column of fluid in the xylem.  Excising the leaf under water ensures
that the xylem remains filled with water, thus maintaining fluid
continuity.  In this experiment, by first transferring the leaves
to a tube of water to check for wilting it is possible to determine
which leaves will be suitable for experimental use.<BR>

<P>
PROCEED TO EXPERIMENT #2 AT THIS POINT.  COMPLETE THE SAMPLE PREPARATION
OUTLINED IN EXPERIMENT #2, PART A, STEP 1, THEN RETURN TO STEP
2 OF THIS EXPERIMENT<BR>

<P>
2.  Obtain two 500 microliter microfuge tubes.  Using a single-edged
razor blade cut the top off of the tube so that a small cup only
5 to 7 mm high remains.  Place these cups in a 96 well microtitre
plate for support.  Add 20 microliter of phenylalanine radiotracer
solution (7.4 x 10<sup>4</sup> Bq U-<sup>14</sup>C-L-phenylalanine; specific activity
14.2 GBq mmol<sup>-1</sup>).  Transfer one leaf to each of the two cups,
taking care not to allow the bottom of their petioles to dry.
 Move the feeding experiment setup to the incubation area where
they will be illuminated at approximately 100 micromole m<sup>-2</sup>sec<sup>-1</sup>
for the next 2 hours.  Watch the leaves carefully during this
time.  If the most of radiotracer solution is taken up before
the end of the 2 hour incubation, quickly transfer the leaves
to a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube containing 1.5 ml of water
and continue the incubation.<BR>

<P>
RETURN TO EXPERIMENT #2  AT THIS POINT.  COMPLETE PART A STEPS
2 TO 5 AND PART B, STEPS 1 TO 5.  DURING THIS TIME WATCH YOUR
LEAF INCUBATIONS TO ENSURE THAT THE LEAVES DO NOT GO DRY!  BECAUSE
EXPERIMENTS 1 AND 2 ARE INTERRELATED, SOME INSTRUCTIONS NECESSARY
FOR THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE REMAINDER OF THIS EXPERIMENT
ARE FOUND IN THE PROTOCOL OF EXPERIMENT #2.<BR>

<P>
3.  At the end of the incubation period, remove the leaves and
transfer each of them to a prelabelled screw-cap microcentrifuge
tube containing 200 microliter of methanol.  Add 5 microliters
of the phenolic acids mixture supplied (10 mg ml<sup>-1</sup> each of cinnamic
acid and p-coumaric acid, 1.0 mg ml<sup>-1</sup> caffeic, ferulic, and sinapic
acids).  Heat for 20 min at 60&deg;C.  Allow to cool to room temperature.
<BR>

<P>
4.  Remove the leaf tissue residue from the microfuge tube with
a pair of tweezers and dispose of it in the radioactive waster
container.   Place the tubes in the speed vac and concentrate
the extract to dryness.<BR>

<P>
5.  Obtain two 10 x 10 cm TLC plates.  With a soft (2B) pencil
and a ruler, mark a horizontal line 1.5 cm above the bottom of
the plate.  Mark a position 1.5 cm from the right hand side of
the plate on this line.  This mark will be the origin for the
first dimension chromatography in the petroleum ether:ethyl acetate:methanol:acetic
acid solvent (described in Experiment #2, Part B).  Mark a vertical
line, 1.5 cm from the left hand vertical edge of the plate.  Mark
a position 1.5 cm from the top edge of the plate on this line.
 This mark will be the origin for the second dimension chromatography
in the toluene:acetic acid:water solvent (described in Experiment
#2, Part B).  The intersection of the horizontal and vertical
lines will mark the origin for the two dimensional TLC.  In the
upper right hand corner, label one plate as WT and the other as
<I>fah1</I>.<BR>

<P>
6.  Spot 5 microliter of the phenolic acids mixture supplied (10
mg ml<sup>-1</sup> each of cinnamic acid and p-coumaric acid, 1 mg ml<sup>-1</sup> caffeic,
ferulic, and sinapic acids) at each of the origins marked for
the one-dimensional solvent runs (bottom right and top left of
each plate).<BR>

<P>
7.  Dissolve each of the dried extracts in 20 microliter of methanol.
Using a P-20 pipettor, start by applying 5 microliters of the
wild type extract to the origin marked for two-dimensional TLC
of the plate labelled WT.  While this sample is drying, apply
the <I>fah1</I> extract to the two-dimensional origin of the <I>fah1</I>
plate in a similar fashion.  Allow each of these aliquots to dry
before applying another aliquot.  Take care to avoid having this
sample origin spread too large by repeated application of sample
without drying in between.  Once most or all of each extract has
been applied, dry the plates thoroughly, and put each plate in
a TLC tank containing the petroleum ether:ethyl acetate:methanol:acetic
acid solvent.<BR>

<P>
8.  Once the solvent has risen to within 1 cm of the top of the
plate, remove the plate and dry it with a hair dryer in the fume
hood.  <B>Turn each plate by 90 degrees</B>, and put them in a
TLC tank containing the toluene:acetic acid:water solvent.  Once
the solvent has again risen to within 1 cm of the top of the plate,
remove the plate and dry it with a hair dryer in the fume hood.
Take the plate to the darkroom and observe it under long wave
and short wave UV light.  Like their esters, hydroxycinnamic acids
have a characteristic fluorescence, except cinnamic and p-coumaric
acids, which are UV-absorbent instead.  Circle the spots with
a soft pencil.<BR>

<P>
9.  Place the two plates in an autoradiography cassette, and place
a film on top of them.  No intensifying screen is necessary. 
Close the cassette and incubate it at -70&deg;C for 4 to 5 days. 
Develop the film, and determine which phenolic acids were labelled
during the incubation.<BR>

<P>
<B>Experiment #2: Thin Layer chromatography<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>Part A: Analysis of Arabidopsis Secondary Metabolites and Hydroxycinnamic
Acids by Thin Layer Chromatography<BR>
</B>
<P>
1.  Plants will be supplied that represent two wild type genotypes
(Columbia wild type, Landsberg <I>erecta</I>) and four mutants
that are affected in phenylpropanoid secondary metabolism (<I>fah1-2</I>,
<I>tt4</I>, <I>fah1-7/tt4</I>, <I>sng1-1</I>).  Remove a single
leaf from a plant representing each genotype, and place each of
them in a pre-labelled microfuge tube.  Add 50 microliter of 50%
methanol to each tube, and grind the tissue briefly using the
blue pestles provided.<BR>

<P>
-&gt; If you have time, it may be interesting to obtain a sample
of another species of plant that is growing outside of the lab,
and make an extract of this plant for comparison.  Plants of the
Lamniaceae and Ericaceae are particularly rich sources of fluorescent
secondary metabolites.  Grass is really boring.<BR>

<P>
RETURN TO EXPERIMENT #1 AT THIS POINT.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
2.  The following TLC solvent will be prepared for you:<BR>

<P>
 Solvent mixture    Solvent ratio
<P>
 n-butanol : ethanol : water   4 : 1: 1<BR>

<P>
Add the TLC solvent to a beaker which you will use as a TLC tank.
 Cover the beaker with foil and allow the solvent to equilibrate
with the vapor phase inside the beaker while you are preparing
your plates.<BR>

<P>
3.  Obtain a 10 x 10 cm silica gel TLC plate.  With a soft (2B)
pencil and a ruler, mark a horizontal line 1.5 cm above the bottom
of the plate.  This line will mark the origin.  Hold the pencil
lightly and at about a 30 degree angle to the plate to avoid scraping
the silica gel.  Starting 1.5 cm from the left edge of the plate,
place six (or seven if you are including another plant species)
small pencil marks along the origin line, spaced 1 cm apart.<BR>

<P>
4.  Using a P-20 pipettor, spot 5 microliters of each extract
on the marks made on the origin line, taking note which extract
was applied at each position.  Allow the spots to dry completely.
<BR>

<P>
-&gt; When applying samples to TLC plates, it is important to
remember that silica gel chromatography is a form of adsorption
chromatography, and water can severely interfere with proper chromatography.
 While each of the solvents used in this experiment contain a
substantial amount of water, many other solvent systems are completely
anhydrous.  In these systems, failure to dry samples thoroughly
after application to the origin can result in unpredictable TLC
results.  On the other hand, many plant secondary metabolites
are prone to oxidation, and are particularly labile once applied
to silica gel TLC plates.  Prolonged drying in an oxidizing environment
(i.e. using a hair dryer rather than a stream of dry nitrogen)
can result in oxidation of the compounds at the origin and anomalous
TLC results.<BR>

<P>
5.  Place your plate, origin side down, in the TLC tank or beaker.
 Replace the cover, and allow the solvent to move up the plates
until it is within 0.5 cm of the top.<BR>

<P>
PROCEED TO PART B AT THIS POINT AND COMPLETE STEPS 1 TO 5.<BR>

<P>
6.  Remove the TLC plate from the tank and dry it with a hair
dryer.  Take the plate to the darkroom and observe it under long
wave and short wave UV light.  Hydroxycinnamic acid esters have
a characteristic fluorescence, except those derived from cinnamic
or p-coumaric acids, which are UV-absorbent instead.<BR>

<P>
-&gt; Some people find the smell of n-butanol to be somewhat objectionable.
 The combination of n-butanol and acetic acid, another common
TLC solvent, is particularly pungent.  Dry your plate thoroughly
in the hood before taking it to the dark room for observation
under UV light.<BR>

<P>
7.  Return to the lab and prepare the diazotized p-nitroaniline
spray reagent.  In the TLC plate sprayer flask, mix 5 mL 0.5%
p-nitroaniline in 2 M HCl, 1 mL 5% sodium nitrite, and 15 mL 20%
sodium acetate.  Swirl the flask to mix.  Assemble the sprayer,
and lightly spray the plate with the spray reagent.  Note the
colour reaction given with each compound.
<P>
<B>Part B: Analysis of Phenolic Acids by Thin Layer Chromatography
<BR>
</B>
<P>
1.  The following TLC solvents have been prepared for you:<BR>

<P>
 Solvent mixture       Solvent ratio
<P>
 petroleum ether : ethyl acetate : methanol : acetic acid 50 :
50 : 5 : 1<BR>

<P>
 Solvent mixture      Solvent ratio
<P>
 toluene : acetic acid : water    2 : 1: saturated<BR>

<P>
-&gt; By adding 2 parts toluene to 1 part of acetic acid, a monophasic
solvent mixture is prepared.  Upon adding a small amount of water
while stirring with a stir bar, the solvent will go cloudy but
will gradually clear as it becomes monophasic.  The addition of
water is repeated until the solvent will no longer clear.  At
this point, the solvent is saturated with water, and is set aside
to separate into an upper organic phase, and a lower aqueous phase.
 If prepared correctly, the lower phase will be very small, perhaps
1 to 2% of the volume of the upper organic phase.<BR>

<P>
2.  Add the TLC solvents to two beakers that will serve as TLC
tanks.  Cover the beakers with aluminum foil and allow the solvent
to equilibrate with the vapour phase inside the tank while you
are preparing your plates.<BR>

<P>
-&gt; It is generally recommended that TLC tanks be pre-equilibrated
with the solvents that are to be used for chromatography.  During
chromatography, the TLC solvent can evaporate from the surface
of the TLC plate.  For relatively non-volatile solvents like the
n-butanol-based solvents used in the previous TLC experiment,
this is not a significant issue.  TLC with this type of solvent
can be conducted without prior equilibration of the tank.  With
volatile solvents such as the toluene- and petroleum ether-based
solvents used for hydroxycinnamic acids, solvent evaporation from
the surface of the plate is a significant concern.  Running these
solvents without prior equilibration can lead to streaking and
Rf values that are significantly higher than those obtained in
saturated tanks.<BR>

<P>
3.  Obtain two 10 x 10 cm silica gel TLC plates.  As before, with
a soft (2B) pencil and a ruler, mark a horizontal line 1.5 cm
above the bottom of the plate.  This line will mark the origin.
 Hold the pencil lightly and at about a 30 degree angle to the
plate to avoid scraping the silica gel.  Starting 1.5 cm from
the left edge of the plate, place six small pencil marks along
the origin line, spaced 1 cm apart.  <BR>

<P>
4.  Using a P-20 pipettor, spot 5 microliter of each of the standard
solutions of phenolic acids provided on the marks made on the
origin line of each plate.  Apply them in the following order:
 cinnamic acid, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, sinapic
acid.<BR>

<P>
5.  Place one of your plates, origin side down, in each of the
TLC tanks or beakers.  Replace the cover, and allow the solvent
to move up the plates until it is within 1 cm of the top.  Note
that these solvents run much more quickly than the n-butanol-based
solvents, and thus should be watched carefully to avoid running
the solvent up to the top of the plate.  <BR>

<P>
RETURN TO EXPERIMENT 1, STEP 3.<BR>

<P>
6.  Remove the TLC plates from the tanks and dry them with a hair
dryer.  Take the plates to the darkroom and observe them under
long wave and short wave UV light.  Like their esters, hydroxycinnamic
acids have a characteristic fluorescence, except cinnamic and
p-coumaric acids, which are UV-absorbent instead.  Circle the
spots with a soft pencil.<BR>

<P>
7.  Return to the lab and spray one or both of the plates with
the diazotized p-nitroaniline spray reagent.  Note the colour
reaction given with each compound.<BR>
