<div>Arabidopsis MYC2&#47;ZBF1&#47;JIN1 is a negative regulator of cryptochrome&#45;mediated blue light signaling, and is a point of cross talk in light, abscisic acid &#40;ABA&#41;, jasmonic acid &#40;JA&#41; and jasmonate&#45;ethylene signaling pathways. Although many regulatory components of light signaling have been functionally characterized, only a few of them have been reported to cross talk with other signaling cascades. Here we report the functional relationships of three important negative regulators: MYC2, COP1 and SPA1 in light signaling pathways and their interplay in light, ABA and JA signaling. The genetic and molecular studies using <span style="font-style: italic">atmyc2 cop1</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">atmyc2 spa1</span> double mutants suggest that <span style="font-style: italic">atmyc2</span> act synergistically with <span style="font-style: italic">cop1</span> or <span style="font-style: italic">spa1</span> suppressing the photomorphogenic growth in the dark. The negative regulatory role of MYC2 in blue light is although dependent on COP1, it enhances SPA1 function in far&#45;red light probably acting in parallel pathway. This study further reveals that COP1 and SPA1 act in ABA and JA signaling pathways. Although <span style="font-style: italic">atmyc2</span> can partially suppress some of the altered physiological responses of <span style="font-style: italic">cop1</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">spa1</span> in light signaling, mutation in <span style="font-style: italic">atmyc2</span> exerts opposite effects on <span style="font-style: italic">cop1</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">spa1</span> in ABA and JA responsiveness. The genetic, molecular and physiological studies in this study collectively suggest that MYC2 plays a balancing role in maintaining the ABA and JA responsiveness controlled by COP1 or SPA1 in a light specific manner. </div>

<div>Arabidopsis ethylene receptor genes negatively regulate ethylene responses and the loss of receptor genes leads to de&#45;repression of ethylene responses. Due to genetic redundancy, it is challenging to dissect function of individual receptor genes. However, unique roles of ethylene receptors have been demonstrated. For example, ETR1 is required for the seedling nutation and the RTE1 function. In this study, phenotypes of mutants defective in multiple receptor genes were comprehensively compared. Our results show that the loss of ERS1 conversely resulted in repression of ethylene while the overexpression of ERS1 confers elevated ethylene responses. It is thus likely that ERS1 can also function as a positive regulator of ethylene responses.  Previously it has been reported that the loss of multiple receptor genes will cause de&#45;repression in ethylene responses. However, our study shows that the receptor identity, rather than the receptor number, is more important to degrees in the repression of ethylene responses.  At last, we show that the dominant etr1&#45;1 receptor gene can cause ethylene insensitivity in a quintuple mutant, lacking all the five wild&#45;type receptor genes, but fails to completely restore rosette growth. This result implies that the ethylene receptors may have functions other than the repression of ethylene responses.</div>

<div>The ethylene signal transduction in Arabidopsis is mediated through a linear pathway involving five ethylene receptors, downstream components, and several regulatory factors. In order to further understand how ethylene responses would be regulated, we focused on the identification of new regulatory components and the study on the receptor signal output. Here we reported that altered expression of a Ser&#47;Thr kinase causes constitutive ethylene responses. On the contrary, the overexpression of the kinase domain leads to ethylene insensitivity. The kinase region is being ectopically expressed in ethylene response mutants to further identify its roles in the regulation of ethylene responses. In an attempt to elucidate how the receptor signal is mediated to downstream components, the ETR1 N&#45;terminal signaling was studied. Previously it is reported that the wild&#45;type ETR1 N terminus cannot repress ethylene responses. However, we found that &#34;etr1&#40;1&#45;349&#41;&#34; restored the growth of &#34;etr1&#45;7 ers1&#45;2&#34;, but not that of &#34;etr1&#45;7 ers1&#45;3&#34;, implying that the wild&#45;type ETR1 N terminus can mediate receptor signal output depending on subfamily I receptors. Besides, the ETR1 N terminus is essential to the function of RTE1, a negative regulator of ethylene responses, while an RTE1 N portion can be dispensable to the etr1&#45;2 function. Specific interactions of &#34;ETR1&#34; and &#34;RTE1&#34; were demonstrated by genetic and transformation studies. Physical interaction between ETR1 and RTE1 was further supported by co&#45;immunoprecipitation. Subcellular localization of RTE1 was studied and possible roles of &#34;RTE1&#34; in the repression of ethylene responses are discussed. Because subfamily I receptors are essential to the ETR1 N terminal signaling while the &#34;RTE1&#34; function is &#34;ETR1&#34; dependent, we further dissected unique function of ETR1 and ERS1. Unexpectedly, genetic analyses reveal that &#34;ERS1&#34; can function as a positive regulator of ethylene responses.</div>

In living cells the CDC48A protein co&#45;localizes with SERK1 at peripheral ER based membranes and the plasma membrane &#40;PM&#41;. F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer&#45;Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy &#40;FRET&#45;FLIM&#41; showed that CDC48A interacts with SERK1 at the PM.<br/>CDC48A is a member of the family of AAA ATPases &#40;ATPases associated with various cellular activities&#41;, shown to have various functions in cell division, membrane fusions and in proteasome and ER associated degradation &#40;ERAD&#41; of proteins. The role of AAA ATPases is to generate mechanical force to disrupt or fuse molecular structures by means of ATP binding and hydrolysis. The AtCDC48A protein was shown by others to play a role in ERAD and in membrane fusions. AAA proteins are present as stacked hexameric rings that are stabilized by the binding of ATP. They are only reported to be active in hexameric form. Employing Fluorescence Correlation spectroscopy, it was shown that in protoplasts the CDC48A hexamers are part of a much larger complex. SERK1 was shown to associate with the active form of the fluorescently tagged CDC48A protein in Arabidopsis protoplasts, therefore implicating a functional relationship between both proteins. <br/></div>

<div>The transcription factor WRKY53 plays an important role in the early stage of Arabidopsis senescence but almost nothing is known of how this factor is regulated. Here, we show that the WRKY53 protein exists in an active and inactive form. WRKY53 can interact with a MAP kinase kinase kinase &#40;MEKK1&#41; which contains a NLS and ser&#47;thr protein kinase domain on the protein level and can be phosphorylated in vitro. The DNA binding affinity of WRKY53 is positively influenced by this phosphorylation. In addition, the expression of the WRKY53 gene is activated by MEKK1 binding directly to CA&#47;TNNTG elements of the WRKY53 promoter regulating the switch of leaf age dependent to plant age dependent expression. Microarray data and northern blot results show that MEKK1 has the same expression pattern as WRKY53 during the developmental period of Arabidopsis plants. The inactive WRKY53 protein interacts with UPL, a putative polyubiquitin ligase E3 which consist of a HECT domain, a leucine zipper motif and a C&#45;type lectin motif, and can be polyubiquitinated in vitro. Induction of UPL expression in transgenic plants leads to a decrease of the WRKY53 protein level. In contrast, an UPL knock&#45;out line shows higher WRKY53 protein levels. The results indicate that MEKK1 positively regulates senescence by directly phosphorylating the WRKY53 transcription factor through a shortcut in the MAPK signaling cascade and UPL negatively regulates senescence by targeting WRKY53 for protein degradation. </div>

<div>Brassinosteroids &#40;BRs&#41; are plant hormones that bind to the plasma&#45;membrane localised receptor BRI1 and consequently activate an intracellular signalling cascade. Central in BR signalling, a GSK&#45;3&#45;like kinase &#40;BIN2&#41; and a Ser&#47;Thr phosphatase &#40;BSU1&#41; modulate the phosphorylation state of transcription factors, which in turn regulate BR&#45;responsive gene expression. Over the past decade, important players in BR signalling have been identified. However, the link between BRI1&#45;activation and the inhibition of BIN2 activity and the regulatory mechanism for BIN2 inhibition itself remain unsolved. Using a chemical genetics approach, we identified a small non&#45;steroidal molecule that induces constitutive BR&#45;responses <span style="font-style: italic">in planta</span> similar to the action of BRs. We provide genetic and biochemical evidence that application of this compound activates the signalling pathway downstream of BRI1 by inhibiting BIN2 kinase activity, hence the name bikinin for BIn2 KINase INhibitor. Bikinin targets specific subgroups of <span style="font-style: italic">Arabidopsis thaliana</span> GSK&#45;3&#45;like kinases, while it has no effects on other plant Ser&#47;Thr protein kinases. Also, the inhibitory effect of bikinin is much weaker on human GSK&#45;3beta kinase activity. Furthermore, in <span style="font-style: italic">Xenopus laevis</span>, bikinin had no effects on embryonic development, even though GSK&#45;3beta is essential in body patterning throughout development. In summary, our study identified the first plant&#45;specific inhibitor of GSK&#45;3&#45;like kinases and demonstrated the existence of non&#45;overlapping GSK&#45;3 inhibition mechanisms in plants and animals.</div>

<div>Senescence is highly regulated process and is genetically controlled. It can be initiated by a wide variety of different factors, both internal and external. As well as being essential part of plant development, senescence in leaves is also induced prematurely by a number of different environmental stresses such as nutrient stress e.g. insufficient nitrogen, phosphorus or water. Plants that have been exposed to oxidative stress such as ozone also show senescence&#45;like symptoms and localized cell death. This response appears to have some similarity to the hypersensitive response seen with incompatible pathogens. Infection by pathogens can result in senescence&#45;like symptoms. Senescence and abscission of the infected leaf is a mechanism that could be useful to reduce the spread of the pathogen to the rest of the plat. Instead of causing senescence&#45;like symptoms, infection with incompatible pathogens can result in a different type of cell death. The promoter region from &#34;LSC54&#34; gene has been cloned and fused in to the &#34;GUS&#34; gene. The seedling from the transformed &#34;Arabidopsis&#34; plants were exposed to a range of different &#34;Peronospora parasitica&#34; isolates, expression of the &#34;GUS&#34; gene was found to be regulated in an isolate&#45;dependent manner.&#13;<br/></div>

<div>Far&#45;red insensitive 219 &#40;FIN219&#41; was previously shown to be involved in phytochrome A&#45;mediated far&#45;red light signaling. To further understand its function and regulatory relation with other light signaling components, a yeast two&#45;hybrid approach was used to isolate FIN219&#45;interacting partners. Here, we demonstrate that a FIN219&#45;interacting protein 1 &#40;FIP1&#41; interacts with FIN219 in vitro and in vivo and is composed of 217 amino acids that belong to the tau class of the large glutathione S&#45;transferase &#40;GST&#41; gene family. FIP1 was further shown to have GST activities. The gain&#45;of&#45;function and partial loss&#45;of&#45;function of FIP1 resulted in a hyposensitive hypocotyl phenotype under continuous far&#45;red light &#40;cFR&#41; and a delayed flowering phenotype under long&#45;day conditions, which suggests that FIP1 may exist in a complex to function in the regulation of Arabidopsis development. As well, FIP1 mRNA was down&#45;regulated in the spa1 mutant and differentially expressed in cop1&#45;4 and cop1&#45;5 mutants under cFR. Intriguingly, FIP1 expression was up&#45;regulated in the fin219 mutant under all light conditions except cFR. Furthermore, promoter activity assays revealed that FIP1 expression was light dependent, mainly associated with vascular tissues, and developmentally regulated. Subcellular localization studies revealed that the GUS&#45;FIP1 fusion protein was localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Taken together, these data indicate that FIP1 may interact with FIN219 to regulate cell elongation and flowering in response to light.</div>

<div>Signaling by reactive oxygen species &#40;ROS&#41; such as H2O2 is well established, but how these signals are sensed at the biochemical level is not clear.  Our results suggest that reversible oxidation of methionine &#40;Met&#41; to Met sulfoxide &#40;MetSO&#41; may be a new mechanism to couple oxidative signals to protein phosphorylation.  For example, calcium dependent protein kinases &#40;CDPKs&#41; and SNF1&#45;related protein kinases &#40;SnRK1s&#41; target the canonical motif &#934;&#45;X&#45;Basic&#45;X&#40;2&#41;&#45;&#91;ST&#93;&#45;X&#40;3&#41;&#45; &#934;, where &#934; is a hydrophobic residue.  We observed that when Met is the essential hydrophobic residue at pS&#45;5 or pS&#43;4, its oxidation to MetSO strongly inhibits phosphorylation in vitro.  This likely occurs because the MetSO sidechain is hydrophilic rather than hydrophobic. That this effect may also occur in vivo is suggested by the observation that transgenic Arabidopsis plants over expressing a peptide Met sulfoxide reductase &#40;PMSRA3&#41; have increased phosphorylation of numerous cellular proteins as revealed by ProQ Diamond Phosphoprotein staining of 2&#45;DE gels.  Preliminary MALDI&#45;TOF MS analysis or immunoblotting with specific antibodies has identified hsp70, nitrate reductase, and chloroplast elongation factor EF&#45;Tu as three of the phosphoproteins that may be sensitive to oxidative signals in vivo.  In silico analysis predicts numerous proteins may be dually regulated by reversible phosphorylation and Met oxidation.  We are speculating that the propensity of Met residues to be reversibly oxidized to MetSO may have been exploited during evolution to produce phosphorylation sites in certain proteins that would be responsive to oxidative signals.  This general mechanism could be of broad significance as oxidative signals are generated during normal growth and also in response to most biotic and abiotic stresses.&#13;<br/>&#13;<br/>&#40;Current or permanent addresses:  Shane Hardin, BASF Plant Science, RTP, NC; Vanita Jain, Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi, India&#41;&#13;<br/></div>

<div>The A&#45;type response regulator ARR4 is an element in the two&#45;component signalling network of Arabidopsis. ARR4 interacts with the N&#45;terminus of the red&#47;far&#45;red light photoreceptor phytochrome B &#40;phyB&#41; and functions as a modulator of photomorphogenesis &#40;Sweere et al., 2001&#41;. In concert with other A&#45;type response regulators, ARR4 also participates in the modulation of the cytokinin response pathway. We present evidence that ARR4 directly modulates the activity state of phyB in planta, not only under inductive but also under extended irradiation with red light &#40;Mira&#45;Rodado et al., 2007&#41;. Mutation of the phosphorylatable aspartate to asparagine within the receiver domain creates an ARR4 version that negatively affects photomorphogenesis. Additional evidence suggests that ARR4 activity is regulated by a phosphorelay mechanism that depends on the AHK family of cytokinin receptors. Accordingly, the ability of ARR4 to function on phyB is modified by exogenous application of cytokinin. These results implicate a cross talk between cytokinin and light signalling mediated by ARR4. This cross talk enables the plant to adjust light reponsiveness to endogenous requirements in growth and development.&#13;<br/>&#13;<br/>Sweere et al. &#40;2001&#41;, Science 294, 1108&#45;1111.&#13;<br/>Mira&#45;Rodado et al. &#40;2007&#41;, J.

<div>Sucrose is the main product of photosynthesis and the most common transport form of carbon in plants. In addition, sucrose is a compound that serves as a signal affecting metabolic flux and development. Here we provide first results of externally induced phosphorylation changes of plasma membrane proteins in Arabidopsis. In an unbiased approach, seedlings were grown in liquid media with sucrose, then starved without sucrose before sucrose was resupplied. Plasma membranes were purified, phosphopeptides enriched, and subsequently analyzed quantitatively by mass spectrometry. In total, 67 phosphopeptides were identified, most of which were quantified over five time points of sucrose resupply. Among the identified phosphorylation sites, the well&#45;described phosphorylation site at the C&#45;terminus of plasma membrane H&#43;&#45;ATPases shows a relative increase in phosphorylation level in response to sucrose. This corresponded to a significant increase of proton pumping activity of plasma membrane vesicles from sucrose supplied seedlings. A new phosphorylation site was identified in the plasma membrane H&#43;&#45;ATPase AHA1 and&#47;or AHA2. This phosphorylation site was shown to be crucial for ATPase activity and overrode regulation via the well&#45;known C&#45;terminal phosphorylation site. Novel phosphorylation sites were identified for both receptor kinases and cytosolic kinases which show rapid increases in relative intensities after short times of sucrose treatment. Seven response classes were identified including non&#45;responsive, rapid&#45;increase &#40;within 3 min&#41;, slow&#45;increase, and rapid&#45;decrease. Relative quantification of phosphorylation changes by phosphoproteomics provides a means for identification of fast responses to external stimuli in plants as a basis for further functional characterization.</div>

<div>Plant growth and development is particularly sensitive to changes in the light environment and especially to vegetational shading. The shade&#45;avoidance response is mainly controlled by the phytochrome photoreceptors. In Arabidopsis, recent studies have identified several related bHLH class transcription factors &#40;the Phytochrome Interacting Factors&#41; as important components in phytochrome signaling. In addition to a related bHLH domain, most of those PIFs share the Active Phytochrome Binding &#40;APB&#41; domain that mediates their interaction with light&#45;activated phytochrome B &#40;phyB&#41;. Here we show that PIF4 and PIF5 act early in the phytochrome signaling pathways to promote the shade avoidance response. PIF4 and PIF5 accumulate to high levels in the dark, are rapidly degraded in response to red light and rapidly re&#45;accumulate under shade&#45;mimicking conditions. Degradation of these transcription factors is preceded by phosphorylation, requires the APB domain and is sensitive to inhibitors of the proteasome, suggesting that PIF4 and PIF5 are degraded upon interaction with light&#45;activated phyB. Our data suggest that in dense vegetation, which is rich in far&#45;red, shade avoidance is triggered, at least partially, as a consequence of reduced phytochrome&#45;mediated degradation of transcription factors such as PIF4 and PIF5. Consistent with this idea, the constitutive shade&#45;avoidance phenotype of phyB mutants is partially reverted in the absence of PIF4.</div>

<div>Oleic acid &#40;18:1&#41; is one of the major monounsaturated fatty acids &#40;FA&#41; of membrane glycerolipids and its biosynthesis is catalyzed by the soluble stearoyl&#45;acyl&#45;carrier&#45;protein&#45;desaturase &#40;S&#45;ACP&#45;DES&#41;. We have previously shown that changes in the levels of 18:1 results in the alteration of salicylic acid &#40;SA&#41;&#45; and jasmonic acid&#45;mediated defense responses &#40;1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6&#41;. This is evident in the Arabidopsis ssi2 mutant, which encodes a defective S&#45;ACP&#45;DES and consequently accumulates high levels of stearic acid &#40;18:0&#41; and low levels of 18:1. Consequently replenishing 18:1 levels results in restoration of wild&#45;type&#45;like signaling in the ssi2 mutant &#40;2, 4, 5, 6&#41;. Plants carrying low levels of 18:1 exhibit enhanced resistance to virulent pathogens, as well as R&#45;gene specific resistance to viral &#40;Turnip crinkle virus&#45;TCV&#41; and bacterial pathogens &#40;7, 8&#41;. We have recently shown that the 18:1&#45;mediated pathway regulates defense signaling by upregulating expression of multiple R genes &#40;9&#41;. Normalizing 18:1 levels by second&#45;site mutations restores R gene expression. Intriguingly, TCV inoculation does not activate the 18:1&#45;regulated pathway in resistant plants, instead it results in the induction of several genes that encode 18:1&#45;synthesizing isozymes. Consequently 18:1 levels in the plant remain constant during a resistance response to TCV. These data suggest that the 18:1&#45;regulated pathway may be specifically targeted during pathogen infection and that alterations of 18:1 levels may serve as a novel strategy for promoting disease resistance.&#13;<br/>&#13;<br/>1.

<div>The plant innate immune system consists of two interconnected branches termed PTI &#40;PAMP&#45;Triggered Immunity&#41; and ETI &#40;Effector&#45;Triggered Immunity&#41; that initiate massive transcriptional reprogramming. Recently, firm genetic evidence has been obtained demonstrating that WRKY transcription factors play a pivotal role in regulating the plant defense transcriptome. In Arabidopsis over 70 &#37; of the entire WRKY gene family of 74 members respond to pathogens or pathogen&#45;mimicking stimuli. Loss&#45;of&#45;<span style="font-style: italic">AtWRKY33</span> function renders plants susceptible to infection by two necrotrophs &#91;1&#93;, whereas <span style="font-style: italic">Atwrky18&#47;Atwrky40</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">Atwrky11&#47;Atwrky17</span> double mutants show enhanced resistance towards <span style="font-style: italic">P. syringae</span> DC3000 &#91;2,3&#93;. Moreover, we recently demonstrated that <span style="font-style: italic">Atwrky18&#47;Atwrky40</span> double mutants are resistant towards the virulent fungus <span style="font-style: italic">G. orontii</span> and that very likely these WRKY factors form an interface that links terminal PTI and ETI signaling to the transcriptional machinery &#91;4&#93;. <br/>Our current studies are focused on: a&#41; using reverse genetics to identify WRKY genes associated with defense and leaf senescence, b&#41; to identify regulators of the immediate&#45;early class of WRKY genes, whose activation does not require de novo protein biosynthesis, and c&#41; use of ChIP to identify in vivo targets of candidate WRKY genes. Data will be presented showing that loss&#45;of&#45;<span style="font-style: italic">AtWRKY27</span>&#45;function results in enhanced tolerance of Col&#45;0 plants towards two vascular bacterial pathogens. For another WRKY transcription factor, <span style="font-style: italic">At</span>WRKY33, our results reveal that rapid pathogen&#45;dependent activation of <span style="font-style: italic">AtWRKY33</span> itself is almost exclusively controlled by a subset of WRKY factor binding sites &#40;W box  elements&#41; within its promoter region. <span style="font-style: italic">At</span>WRKY33 functions as a regulator of pathogen defense responses and interacts with MKS1, a putative nuclear coupling factor acting downstream of MAP kinase 4 &#40;MPK4; &#91;5&#93;&#41;.<br/><br/>1.

<div>Signaling through the heterotrimeric G&#45;proteins &#40;G&#45;proteins&#41; is conserved in diverse eukaryotes. Receptor for Activated C Kinase 1 &#40;RACK1&#41; is a tryptophan&#45;aspartic acid&#45;domain repeat &#40;WD40 repeat&#41; protein that serves as a versatile scaffold protein which binds numerous signaling molecules from diverse signal transduction pathways in mammals. Mutational analysis indicated that both G&#45;proteins and RACK1 mediate hormone responses and play regulatory roles in multiple developmental processes in plants. Here we demonstrate how G&#45;proteins and RACK1 may constitute a signaling complex to regulate the responsivenesses to auxin and abscisic acid &#40;ABA&#41; in Arabidopsis. Loss&#45;of&#45;function mutations in the Arabidopsis G&#45;protein alpha &#40;GPA1&#41; subunit, beta subunits &#40;AGB1&#41;, and RACK1 all confer alterations in auxin&#45;induced lateral root formation and ABA&#45;mediated seed germination inhibition. Therefore, we use lateral root formation and seed germination as two model systems to dissect the roles of G&#45;proteins and RACK1 in auxin and ABA responses respectively. We provide biochemical, molecular and cellular, and genetic evidence that G&#45;proteins and RACK1 could work dependently or independently in a tissue&#47;cell&#45;specific manner. These findings offer a possible fine&#45;tuning molecular mechanism through which the G&#45;proteins modulate hormonal signaling and regulate phenotypic and developmental plasticity.</div>

<div>Jasmonic acid &#40;JA&#41;, a lipid&#45;derived signaling compound, is well known for its role in flower development and plant defense. However, the molecular mechanism of JA signaling remains unclear. The F&#45;box protein, COI1, is required for all responses to JA. COI1 is a component of SCFCOI1 complex, an E3 ubiquitin ligase and therefore COI1 links JA signaling to the ubiquitin&#47;26S proteasome pathway. Despite the important role of COI1 in JA signaling, the key components, substrates of SCFCOI1, have not been identified to date. Here, we describe a new family of eight HAVOC &#40;HVC&#41; genes which were rapidly upregulated by JA in our previous transcription profiling experiments of JA signaling in opr3 stamens. Our results demonstrate that HVC proteins act as repressors of JA&#45;responses. Most interestingly, JA treatment causes HVC degradation by SCFCOI1, which allow propagation of the JA signal. Our characterization of the HVC family provides the basis for understanding the broad functions of JA in defense responses and development of plants, and gives us an opportunity to further investigate the mechanism of JA signaling.</div>

<div>Brassinosteroids &#40;BRs&#41; play essential roles in regulating many physiological and developmental processes in plants.  BRs are perceived at cell surface by a leucine&#45;rich repeat &#40;LRR&#41; receptor serine&#47;threonine kinase, BRI1.  BRs bind to the extracellular domain of  BRI1 and induce the phosphorylation of the carboxy&#45;terminus and other domains of the pre&#45;existing BRI1 homodimers.  This leads to an enhanced affinity of BRI1 for BAK1, a second LRR&#45;receptor kinase.  A newly identified  protein, BKI1 specifically interacts with BRI1 and keeps the receptor in an inactive state by preventing the interaction of BRI1 with its positive interactors, such as BAK1.  The phenotypes of Arabidopsis that over&#45; or under&#45;express BKI1 and the phosphorylation status of BES1 suggest that BKI1 is a negative regulator of BR signaling.  BRs induce a rapid dissociation of BKI1&#45;YFP from the plasma membrane in a BRI1&#45;dependent manner and release the inhibitory effect. A myristoylated BKI1 can constantly associates with plasma membrane and strongly inhibits plant growth.  In addition, BKI1 is a phosphoprotein in vivo and can be phosphorylated by BRI1 kinase in vitro, suggesting that BRI1&#45;dependent phosphorylation of BKI1 may be essential for its dissociation from plasma membrane.  We have also been identifying factors that interact with BKI1 and investigating the biochemical roles of BKI1 in BRI1 signaling.  A model of BKI1&#8217;s function in BR signaling is proposed. </div>

<div>      Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer &#40;BRET&#41; is a biological phenomenon in some marine organisms such as <span style="font-style: italic">Renilla reniformis</span> and jellyfish where resonance energy from the enzymatic decarboxylation of coelenterazine is transferred from a luciferase to a spectrally compatible fluorescent protein. The distance between the energy donor, for example <span style="font-style: italic">Renilla</span> luciferase &#40;RLUC&#41;, to the energy acceptor, for example yellow fluorescent protein &#40;YFP&#41; should be &#126;5nm. In a typical experiment, a candidate protein is genetically fused to RLUC, and its putative interaction partner is fused to YFP. Although BRET has already been applied successfully to monitor and even image <span style="font-style: italic">in vivo</span> protein&#45;protein interactions in real time, there is room for optimization of RLUC&#8217;s enzymatic activity. Homology modeling predicted a hydrophobic binding pocket coordinated by 24 amino acids. A gateway composed of residues I163, M174, F180, and T184 is connected to a catalytic triad composed of Asp120, Glu144, and His285. Site&#45;directed and random mutagenesis, as well as pharmacological tests were carried out on RLUC expressed in <span style="font-style: italic">E. coli</span> to test the model of the RLUC structure and its mechanism. Based on the mutagenesis result, we generated a new triple mutant which showed increased luciferase activity and increased half&#45;life, and was more resistant to inhibition by high substrate concentration. Our results provide enzymatic characteristics of RLUC and, furthermore, suggest that the RLUC triple mutant may possess advantageous properties for BRET assays and BRET imaging of protein&#45;protein interactions in <span style="font-style: italic">Arabidopsis</span>. </div>

<div>Callus is a mass of dedifferentiated cells and formed in wound&#45;healing tissue. Phytohormones, namely auxin and cytokinin, are known to be key regulators for the induction of cell&#45;dedifferentiation and callus formation. However, factors that induces and&#47;or maintain the dedifferentiated state has not been characterized. To identify such factors, we performed comparative analyses of the gene expression profiles between Arabidopsis seedlings and three callus lines by DNA microarray, and found that a gene for the plant specific transcription factor of AP2&#47;ERF family designated as <span style="font-style: italic">Callus Formation Factor 1</span> &#40;<span style="font-style: italic">CAF1</span>&#41; was upregulated in the cell lines. When <span style="font-style: italic">CAF1</span> was ectopically expressed under CaMV 35S promoter, the transgenic lines induced callus in the shoot, hypocotyl and root. Surprisingly, the callus generated from the overexpressor &#40;CAF1 callus&#41; grew and maintained dedifferentiation state without addition of phytohormone. The seedlings of the T2 generation of the overexpressor with weak phenotype were dedifferentiated into callus with lower concentration of auxin, in which condition wild type seedlings did not form callus. To investigate whether CAF1 increase endogenous auxin concentration, auxin&#45;responsive promoter&#45;reporter activity was examined in the CAF1 callus. However, the promoter activity was not detected in the callus without addition of external auxin. Moreover, the concentration of endogenous free auxin was not different between the <span style="font-style: italic">CAF1</span> overexpressor and wild type seedlings. These results suggest that CAF1 is not likely to increase the auxin concentration. <span style="font-style: italic">CAF1</span> promoter activity was detected in wounded part of tissues and in callus. Microarray analysis showed that expression of wounding&#45;responsive genes and cultured&#45;cell&#45;upregulated genes were significantly enhanced in <span style="font-style: italic">CAF1</span> overexpressor. Our result suggest that transcription factor CAF1 plays an important role on the callus formation and wound&#45;healing process.</div>

<div>In Arabidopsis, differential regulation of genes involved in the photosynthesis and carbon metabolism is sensed by AtHXK1. Though photosynthetic prokaryotic cyanobacteriun Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 does also show glucose&#45;induced differential expression of genes involved in bioenergetics and carbon metabolism similar to those of Arabidopsis, glucose signaling is not sensed by a glucokinase Sll0593, instead by unknown sensor downstream glucose phosphorylation. This difference could be due to either the inability of cyanobacterial Sll0593 to function as a glucose sensor or lacking certain interacting factor&#40;s&#41; present in the Arabidopsis, but not in Synechocystis. In order to answer this question, the Sll0593 was introduced into the glucose insensitive Arabidopsis mutant, gin2&#45;1. Arabidopsis Sll0593 overexpressing transgenics regained their sensitivity to glucose treatment with respect to seedling growth and development along with transcript levels of genes known responsive to glucose. Based on these results, we suggest that inability for Sll0593 to sense glucose in Synechocystis is attributable to lacking of interacting protein factors. To exploit proteins interacting with both AtHXK1 and Sll0593, we conducted yeast two hybrid analyses, resulting in several candidates. Currently, functional characterization of these proteins is under way. </div>

<div>Recognition of pathogens initiates complex signaling networks which activate multicomponent defense responses. Mitogen activated protein kinases &#40;MAPKs&#41;, which are activated upon various abiotic and biotic stresses, are important cellular defense signaling components in plants. The existence of multigene families encoding MAPK cascade elements together with the redundancy between individual elements in diverse cellular signaling pathways has further complicated functional analysis of signal&#45;response specificities.<br/>Our studies focus primarily on AtMPK3, AtMPK4 and AtMPK6, which are involved in defense signaling. Treatment of Arabidopsis leaves or seedlings with the flagellin&#45;derived flg22 peptide initiates transient increases of cytosolic calcium levels followed by activation of these 3 MAP kinases. Initial gel filtration analyses demonstrated that portions of MAP kinases exist in higher molecular weight complexes. In addition to yeast&#45;2&#45;hybrid screens, Tandem Affinity Purification &#40;TAP&#41; is being used to isolate components of MAP kinase protein complexes. TAP&#45;tagged constructs of MAP kinase cascade elements have been generated in the respective knock&#45;out background to eliminate competition from endogenous untagged proteins. In vivo interactions of protein partners are verified by fluorescence resonance energy transfer &#40;FRET&#41; analyses. FRET was first established based on known components of MAP kinase cascades and extended to candidate interactors isolated by the above&#45;mentioned approaches. An ethylene&#45;response&#45;factor&#45;like transcription factor &#40;identified from Y2H screen&#41; was confirmed to interact with MPK6 in vivo, in a flg22&#45;dependent manner. <br/>In parallel, an in vitro kinase assay was performed on protein arrays with 1700 recombinant Arabidopsis proteins. Among the potential targets, aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid synthase&#45;6, a known MAPK substrate, was found to be phosphorylated specifically by AtMPK6. This shows that the in vitro screen can potentially uncover real in vivo targets of MAP kinases.<br/></div>

<div>Stomata form pores on leaves and function to regulate the uptake of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and the loss of water during transpiration under changing environmental conditions. These two physiological processes are of central importance to plant growth and development, contributing to overall carbon assimilation and nutrient uptake. To do this, stomata open or close in response to various environmental stimuli, including light, humidity, atmospheric CO2 and plant hormones. The guard cell pair that surrounds the stomatal pore control stomatal aperture by regulated changes in cell turgor. Sphingosine&#45;1&#45;phosphate &#40;S1P&#41; has been shown to be an important lipid mediator of stomatal guard cell responses to the drought hormone, abscisic acid &#40;1,2&#41;. Additionally, there is evidence to suggest that Phyto&#45;S1P also regulates changes in stomatal apertures &#40;3&#41;. It is likely that the availability of sphingoid bases &#40;sphingosine and phytosphingosine, and hence S1P and Phyto&#45;S1P, respectively&#41; is regulated by the concerted action of both delta&#45;4&#45;desaturases and sphingolipid C4&#45;hydroxylases. We have used fluorescent protein&#45;fusions to demonstrate that the delta&#45;4&#45;desaturase and sphingolipid C4&#45;hydroxylases are localized to the endoplasmic reticulum.

<div>Animals use many secretory peptide mediators for control of development. Plants also use peptide mediators, such as phytosulphokine, CLV3 and CLV3&#45;like proteins. To identify novel mediators that regulate plant development, we carried out a genome&#45;scale screen, in which we assayed the effect on Arabidopsis development of individually overexpressing 153 genes predicted to encode small &#40;&#60;150aa&#41; secreted peptides.  Through this screen, we identified a gene EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR 1 &#40;EPF1&#41; and EPF2 that decreased stomatal density when overexpressed.  We show that EPF1 is expressed in stomatal cells and precursors and that controls stomatal patterning through regulation of the asymmetric cell division forming a stomatal precursor. EPF1 activity is dependent on the TOO MANY MOUTHS receptor&#45;like protein and ERECTA&#45;family receptor&#45;kinases suggesting that EPF1 may provide a positional cue interpreted by these receptors. On the other hands, EPF2 regulates the density of stomatal lineage.</div>

<div>In order to sustain optimal plant growth, developmentally regulated gene expression has to be adjusted according to endogenous signals, such as the supply of nutrition, and to exogenous signals such as environmental stresses. By forming specific heterodimers, Arabidopsis thaliana group C and S1 basic leucine zipper &#40;bZIP&#41; transcription factors &#40;TFs&#41; might serve this function as a signal integration network.<br/>Transcriptome analysis reveals that the group S1 TF AtbZIP53 is involved in regulating seed storage protein genes &#40;2S1&#41; as well as stress related genes, such as the proline dehydrogenase &#40;ProDH&#41; gene involved in degradation of the compatible osmolyte proline. Functional studies in transgenic overexpressing plants &#40;Pro35S:AtbZIP53&#41;, T&#45;DNA insertion lines &#40;atbzip53&#41;, as well as Chromatin Immuno Precipitation &#40;ChIP&#41; and transient promoter assays in protoplasts reveal that 2S1 and ProDH are direct targets of AtbZIP53. However, heterodimerisation studies performed by yeast two&#45;hybrid &#40;Y2H&#41;, protoplast two&#45;hybrid &#40;P2H&#41;1 and Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation &#40;BiFC&#41; assays reveal that AtbZIP53 function depends on the formation of heterodimers with group C bZIP TFs. Heterodimerisation leads to a strongly enhanced target gene activation, designated as heterodimer induced transactivation &#40;HIT&#41;2. Since group C and S1 members are regulated transcriptionally and post&#45;transcriptionally by various stimuli, heterodimerisation might provide a mechanism to integrate signals in order to fine tune gene expression essential for agronomically important traits. <br/><br/>References: <br/>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ehlert A, Weltmeier F, Wang X, Smeekens S, Vicente&#45;Carbajosa J, Dr&#246;ge&#45;Laser W. &#40;2006&#41; Plant J. 46: 890 &#8211; 900.<br/>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weltmeier F,  Ehlert A, Mayer CS, Dietrich K, Wang X, Sch&#252;tze K, Alonso R Harter K, Vicente&#45;Carbajosa J,  Dr&#246;ge&#45;Laser W.

<div>ER stress occurs when the protein folding machinery is compromised and unfolded proteins accumulate within the ER lumen. It is relieved by triggering the unfolded protein response &#40;UPR&#41;, a complex protective response that is initiated by signaling from the ER to the nucleus. We have reported that Arabidopsis plants homozygous for agb1&#45;2, a null allele of the gene coding for the G&#946; subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein, are resistant to tunicamycin, a protein glycosylation inhibitor that triggers ER stress and cell death.  When compared with wildtype plants or gpa1&#45;4 homozygotes which lack the G&#945; subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein, G&#946; mutant plants exhibit a delayed and attenuated UPR, as judged by the induction of ER stress markers such as BiP, PDI and P58IPK and the presence of large protein aggregates, and little or no cell death.  Taken together with the ER localization of a majority of the G&#946; protein, these observations suggest that the G&#946; complex has an important ER signaling function in UPR and UPR&#45;associated cell death.  Here we investigate the role of ROS in cell death signaling during UPR. We find that tunicamycin induces a biphasic oxidative burst that exerts a protective effect against UPR&#45;associated cell death.  Inhibition of ROS production by diphenylene iodonium &#40;DPI&#41;, a flavin oxidase inhibitor, and treatment with the ROS scavenger N&#45;acetyl cysteine delay the expression of UPR marker genes and increase the sensitivity of Arabidopsis plants to tunicamycin&#45;induced cell death.  We find that the area of dead tissue that develops in response to local subepidermal infiltration of tunicamycin is much larger in ROS&#45;inhibited plants than in untreated plants and in AtrbohD homozygotes than in wildtype plants. We further observe that UPR&#45;induced cell death is suppressed in plants carrying the bacterial NahG gene encoding salicylate hydroxylase.  Thus ROS signaling evokes a protective response that curtails the spread of UPR&#45;induced cell death mediated by salicylic acid. These observations thus reveal novel aspects of the operation of known cellular and intercellular stress signaling and defense networks in response to signals emanating from the ER.  &#13;<br/>&#13;<br/></div>

<div>Jasmonates &#40;JAs&#41; are essential phytohormones structurally similar to metazoan prostaglandins and potent anti&#45;cancer agents in humans. In spite of their importance for plant development and survival the molecular details of their signalling pathway remain largely unknown. The identification of COI1 as an F&#45;box protein almost a decade ago suggested the existence of a repressor of JA responses targeted by SCFCOI1 for degradation by the proteasome in response to JA. Here we report the identification of JASMONATE&#45;INSENSITIVE 3 &#40;JAI3&#41; and show that it belongs to a novel family of JA&#45;regulated nuclear targets of SCFCOI1, named JAIL &#40;JAI3&#45;Like&#41;, which share conserved domains with CONSTANS &#40;CO&#41; and CO&#45;related proteins. JAI3 and other JAIL proteins physically interact with COI1, and JA treatment induces their SCFCOI1&#45;dependent, proteasome degradation. The jai3&#45;1 allele encodes a mutant protein resistant to degradation that also inhibits degradation of the wild&#45;type JAI3 and other JAILs, explaining its dominant JA&#45;insensitive phenotype. In addition, we show that JAI3 and other JAILs physically interact with the key transcriptional activator of JA&#45;regulated gene expression, AtMYC2, which suggests a model of JAI3&#47;JAILs action as co&#45;repressors of AtMYC2. Our results demonstrate that JAILs are direct targets of the E3 ligase SCFCOI1, linking ubiquitin&#45;mediated protein degradation to transcriptional activation of JA&#45;responses. Moreover, our results show the existence of a negative regulatory feed&#45;back loop involving AtMYC2 and JAILs that provides a mechanistic explanation for the pulsed response to the hormone and the subsequent desensitization of the cell.&#13;<br/>&#13;<br/>&#40;A.C., S.F. and G.F. contributed equally to this work&#41;</div>

<div>The phy&#45; and cry&#45;mediated red, far&#45;red, and blue light perception and signaling regulate plant photomorphogenesis. We have identified an Arabidopsis knock&#45;out mutant shb1 or short hypocotyl under blue 1. However, shb1&#45;D, a dominant gain&#45;of&#45;function allele, exhibited a long hypocotyl phenotype under red, far&#45;red, and blue light. Therefore, SHB1 is involved in cry&#45;mediated blue light signaling but overexpression of SHB1 may expand its signaling activity to red and far&#45;red light. SHB1 is homologous to SYG1 protein family, and contains a N&#45;terminal SPX domain and a C&#45;terminal EXS domain. In order to investigate the structure and function of SHB1 in light signaling, we have conducted transgenic deletion analysis and forward genetic screen for intragenic or extragenic suppressors. The transgenic plants that overexpress the N&#45;terminal 520 amino acids phenocopied shb1&#45;D with a long hypocotyl phenotype under red, far&#45;red, and blue light. In contrast, the transgenic plants that overexpress three C&#45;terminal truncations showed a short hypocotyl under blue light similar to shb1. The phenotypes may be created through a dominant negative mechanism, and all three truncations encompass the putative EXS domain. Forward genetic suppressor screens of shb1&#45;D have identified 58 suppressors. Among them, 10 have been characterized as intragenic suppressors and the rest are extragenic. The intragenic suppressors all contained mis&#45;sense mutations in the SHB1 gene and caused several amino acids alterations in its N&#45;terminal SPX domain. In summary, we demonstrated that the SPX domain is important for SHB1 signaling, whereas the EXS domain may be involved in the formation of a homodimer or an interaction of SHB1 with other protein molecules.</div>

<div>Light has a profound effect on plant growth and development, and plants have evolved three families of photoreceptors to sense their ambient light conditions, including the red and far&#45;red light&#45;absorbing phytochromes and the blue and UV&#45;A light&#45;absorbing cryptochromes and phototropins. The photoreceptors, after being excited by light photons of various wavelengths, initiate downstream signaling cascades and regulate very similar set of plant responses such as de&#45;etiolation, photoperiodic flowering, and circadian rhythm. The coordination and integration among the different signaling pathways have been documented extensively. We have screened an Arabidopsis T&#45;DNA insertion population for mutants defective in their de&#45;etiolation responses under red light condition, and identified one long hypocotyl mutant, <span style="font-style: italic">itl1</span> for <span style="font-style: italic">insensitive to light 1</span>. Genetic studies have revealed that the <span style="font-style: italic">itl1</span> mutation is recessive. Like many other mutants involved in light signaling, the <span style="font-style: italic">itl1</span> mutation also caused petiole and flowering phenotypes. Although isolated from a T&#45;DNA insertional population, the <span style="font-style: italic">itl1</span> mutant was kanamycin&#45;sensitive. We have therefore initiated efforts to clone the mutated gene through a map&#45;based strategy. Preliminary studies have mapped the <span style="font-style: italic">itl1</span> mutation to a 100 KB region on chromosome 4. Future studies will be directed to complement the mutant phenotype with genomic contigs and to identify a second mutant allele from the public T&#45;DNA knockout collections.</div>

<div>Abscisic acid &#40;ABA&#41; plays crucial roles in various aspects of plant growth and development, as well as in adaptation to adverse environmental stresses. A series ABA signal components have been characterized. The key component of ABA signaling ABI1 regulates several ABA responses. As a target of the PP2C ABI1, the Arabidopsis thaliana homeobox protein AtHB6 functions down&#45;stream of ABI1 and acts as a negative regulator in ABA signal pathway &#40;Himmelbach et al., 2002&#41;. &#13;<br/>To identify more ABA signaling components, the screening for the interaction partners of AtHB6 was performed. And the AtGluRS &#40;Arabidopsis thaliana glutamyl&#45;tRNA synthetase&#41; were identified through screening of the arabidopsis cDNA libraries in a yeast two&#45;hybrid system by using the N&#45;terminal AtHB6 as the bait. Further studies in yeast three&#45;hybrid system and the in vivo co&#45;immunoprecipitation revealed that the AtGluRS interacts not only with AtHB6 but also with ABI1. It suggested that the complicated interaction presented among AtHB6, AtGluRS and ABI1.&#13;<br/>The function of the interaction between AtGluRS, AtHB6 and ABI1 was surveyed using maize protoplast transient expression system. The co&#45;expression of ABI1 with AtHB6 elevated two fold the AtHB6&#45;activated gene expression, while the AtGluRS exerted an inhibition in the AtHB6&#45;activated expression of the reporter gene. Results demonstrate a positive regulatory role of ABI1 and a suppression effect of AtGluRS upon the AtHB6 function. A basis for explaining these findings was provided by the protein localization studies, which revealed that the AtGluRS&#45;GUS was strictly localized in the cytoplasm, and the ecotopic expressed AtHB6&#45;GUS was in the nucleus, while the co&#45;expression of both AtGluRS and AtHB6&#45;GUS resulted in both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of AtHB6&#45;GUS. Thus, the AtGluRS is postulated to interact with AtHB6 in cytoplasm and reduce the nuclear compartmentation of AtHB6, consequently the function of AtHB6 as the transcriptional regulator is suppressed. The results unravel a new function of AtGluRS as a positive regulator in ABA signal pathway through inhibiting the function of the ABA negative regulator AtHB6.&#13;<br/></div>

<div>The heterotrimeric G protein complex is encoded by single canonical G&#945; and G&#946; subunit genes and two G&#947; subunit genes in Arabidopsis &#40;AGG1 and AGG2&#41; raising the possibility that the two potential G protein complexes mediate different cellular processes. Analysis of mutants with reduced expression of one or both G&#947; genes revealed specialized roles for each G&#947; subunit. AGG1&#45;, but not AGG2&#45;deficient mutants showed impaired resistance against necrotrophic pathogens, reduced induction of the plant defensin gene PDF1.2 and decreased sensitivity to methyl jasmonate. In contrast, both AGG1&#45; and AGG2&#45;deficient mutants were hypersensitive to auxin&#45;mediated induction of lateral roots suggesting that G&#946;&#947;1 and G&#946;&#947;2 synergistically inhibit auxin&#45;dependent lateral root initiation. However, the involvement of each individual G&#947; subunit in this root response differ, with G&#946;&#947;1 acting within the central cylinder attenuating acropetally transported auxin signaling, while G&#946;&#947;2 affects the action of basipetal auxin and gravi&#45;responsiveness within the epidermis and&#47;or cortex, consistent with their gene expression patterns. This selectivity also operates in the hypocotyl. Selectivity in G&#946;&#947; signaling was also found in other known AGB1&#45;mediated pathways. agg1 mutants were hypersensitive to glucose and the osmotic agent mannitol during seed germination, while agg2 mutants were only affected by glucose. Our results show that both G&#947; subunits form functional G&#946;&#947; dimers and each provide functional selectivity to the plant heterotrimeric G proteins, revealing a mechanism underlying the complexity of G protein mediated signaling in plants.</div>

<div>Arabidopsis RTE1 encodes a membrane protein and functions as a negative regulator of ethylene responses. Through genetic and transformation studies, here we show that the function of RTE1 is primarily dependent on ETR1 dosages and can be independent of the other receptors. To narrow down possible regions that are essential to the function of ETR1 and RTE1, truncated etr1 and rte1 were each expressed ectopically. The ETR1 N terminus is essential to the RTE1 function and ectopic expression of ETR1 N terminus restored ethylene insensitivity in 35S::gRTE1 etr1&#45;7. N terminal deletions in RTE1 also restored ethylene insensitivity in etr1&#45;2 rte1&#45;2. These data suggest that ETR1 and RTE1 may each function through specific domains. Possible interaction between ETR1 and RTE1 was examined by co&#45;immunoprecipitation and our result shows that RTE1 can associate with ETR1 but not ERS1. The RTE1 transcript accumulates upon ethylene treatment but its promoter activity was not ethylene&#45;inducible, implying post&#45;transcriptional regulation of the RTE1 transcript. Sub&#45;cellular localization of RTE1 was studied using GFP&#45;RTE1 fusion and RTE1 could function in Golgi. Possible mechanisms by which ethylene responses are repressed by RTE1 and ETR1 is discussed.</div>

<div>Heterotrimeric G proteins &#40;G&#45;proteins&#41; are a diverse class of signal transducing proteins which have been implicated in a variety of important roles in plants.  When G&#45;proteins are activated, they dissociate into two functional subunits &#40;&#945; and the &#946;&#947; dimer&#41; that effectively relay the signal to a multitude of effectors. In animal systems, the &#946;&#947; dimer is anchored to the plasma membrane by a prenyl group present in the &#947; subunit and membrane localization has proven vital for heterotrimer function. A semi&#45;dominant negative strategy was designed aiming to disrupt heterotrimer function in Arabidopsis thaliana &#40;ecotype Columbia&#41; plants by over&#45;expressing a truncated &#947; subunit lacking the isoprenylation motif &#40;&#947;&#42;&#41;. Northern analysis shows that the levels of expression of the mutant &#947; subunit in several transgenic lines &#40;35S&#45;&#947;&#42;&#41; are orders of magnitude higher than that of the native subunits.  In&#45;depth characterization of the 35S&#45;&#947;&#42; lines has been carried out, specifically focusing on a number of developmental characteristics and responses to several stimuli previously shown to be affected in &#945;&#45; and &#946;&#45;deficient mutants. In all cases, the transgenic lines expressing the mutant gamma subunit behave in the same way as the &#945;&#45; and&#47;or the &#946;&#45;deficient mutants, albeit with reduced severity of the phenotype.  Our data indicates that signaling from both functional subunits, &#945; and the &#946;&#47;&#947; dimer, is disrupted in the transgenic plants.  Even though physical association of the subunits has been previously reported, our research provides evidence of the functional association of &#945; and &#946; with the &#947; subunits in Arabidopsis, while also suggesting that plasma membrane localization may be critical for function of plant heterotrimeric G proteins.</div>

<div>Protein kinase CK2 is an evolutionary conserved Ser&#47;Thr phosphotransferase composed by two distinct subunits,alpha&#40;catalitic&#41;, and beta &#40;regulatory&#41;. In Arabidopsis each subunit is encoded by four genes that fulfill partial specific and partial redundant functions.  In order to study the effects of loss&#45;of funtion mutants of CK2 in plant systems we have undertaken a dominant&#45;negative approach by stable overexpression of a CK2 kinase&#45;inactive mutant generated by site&#45;directed mutagenesis. A conserved lysine residue of the catalytic subunit, involved in ATP binding, was changed to Metionine, and the resulting protein was catalitically inactive. The construct was cloned downstream of an inducible promoter to avoid possible lethal effects, and stable transformed Arabidopsis plants and tobacco BY2 cells were obtained. We found that induction of the catalytically inactive CK2 was lethal in Arabidopsis plants, and that dark&#45;grown mutants exhibited short hypocothyls but they do not express light&#45;induced genes in the dark. In synchronized BY2 cells, induction of the transgene provoked cell arrest in G2, that was apparent both phenotipically and by the expression pattern of cell&#45;cycle marker genes. Induction of CK22&#45;inactive subunit in Arabidopsis for short times allowed plant survival but lateral root formation was completely suppressed. Our results support the idea of CK2 as a positive regulator of cell division and likely of cell expansion&#47;elongation.</div>

<div>GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1 &#40;GID1&#41; encodes a soluble GA receptor that shares sequence similarity with a hormone sensitive lipase &#40;HSL&#41;. Previously, a yeast two hybrid &#40;Y2H&#41; assay revealed that the GID1&#45;GA complex directly interacts with SLR1, a DELLA repressor protein in GA signaling. Recently, we also demonstrated, by a pull&#45;down and Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation &#40;BiFC&#41; experiments, that the GA&#45;dependent GID1&#45;SLR1 interaction occurs in planta. GA4 was found to have the highest affinity to GID1 in Y2H assays and is the most effective form of gibberellin in planta. Domain analysis of SLR1 by Y2H assay and gel filtration analysis revealed that the DELLA and TVHYNP domains of SLR1 are required for the GID1&#45;SLR1 interaction. To identify the important regions of GID1 for GA&#45; and SLR1&#45;interactions, we used many different mutant versions of GID1, such as the spontaneous mutant GID1s, N&#45; and C&#45;terminal truncated GID1s, and mutagenized GID1 proteins with conserved amino acids replaced with alanine.<br/>  The amino acid residues important for SLR1&#45;interaction overlapped the residues required for GA&#45;binding, that were scattered throughout the GID1 molecule. When we plotted these residues on the GID1 structure predicted by analogy with HSL tertiary structure, many residues were located at regions corresponding to the substrate binding pocket and lid. Further, the GA&#45;GID1 interaction was stabilized by SLR1. Based on these observations, we proposed a molecular model for interaction between GA, GID1, and SLR1.   <br/></div>

<div>Oxylipins such as jasmonic acid &#40;JA&#41; play central roles in the wound response and during pathogenesis and several studies have confirmed the important role of the canonical jasmonate pathway in plant defense. However, little is known about the initial steps that regulate JA production early in attack. Lipoxygenases &#40;LOXs&#41; are non&#45;heme dioxygenases that catalyse the hydroperoxydation of triunsaturated fatty acids to initiate JA synthesis. We recently isolated the fatty acid oxygenation upregulated &#40;&#8220;fou2&#8221;&#41; mutant in which leaf LOX activity is elevated. When wounded &#8220;fou2&#8221; overproduces JA. Levels of AtLOX2, 3, 4 and 6 transcripts are elevated in &#8220;fou2&#8221; leaves. The &#34;fou2&#34; mutant implicates cation flux in the regulation of JA production &#40;Bonaventure &#34;et al.&#34;, 2007&#41;.&#13;<br/>AtLOX2 is a good candidate for a potential regulation target of the JA pathway, because it is the main LOX occurring in expanded Arabidopsis leaves. Also several plant LOXs have been shown to possess putative calcium&#45;binding domains.&#13;<br/>A single recessive mutant of AtLOX2 was characterised. These plants are fully fertile and do not show altered susceptibility to &#8220;Botrytis cinerea&#8221; infection. Quantitative oxylipin analysis showed that &#8220;lox2&#8221; can still accumulate JA after wounding, which suggests that LOX2 is not the only LOX involved in JA synthesis. Moreover, LOX2 activity was shown to be activated &#8220;in vitro&#8221; by addition of divalent cations. In further &#8220;in vitro&#8221; and &#8220;in vivo&#8221; experiments we will investigate how cations may affect LOX2 activity and how this related to the initiation of JA synthesis.&#13;<br/></div>

<div>Perception and response to mechanical stimuli are important to the fitness of  organisms.  In animal cells, mechanosensing involves the release of ATP and the perception of extracellular ATP by cell surface G&#45;protein coupled receptors.  Plant roots are mechanostimulated as they circumnavigate obstacles during their gravity vector mediated downward growth and mechanostimulation of roots causes ATP release. Plant roots lacking a heterotrimeric G&#45;protein complex have a normal gravity&#45;oriented growth response but they poorly circumnavigate barriers indicating that the single G protein complex in Arabidopsis is involved in mechanosensing. We dynamically profiled the spatio&#45;temporal changes in ATP and calcium and show that when roots reach a barrier, they utilize a mechanically&#45;stimulated release of ATP distal to the touch position.  Touch and ATP induce changes in cytosolic calcium.  Roots lacking a heterotrimeric G protein display touch&#45;induced increase in extracellular ATP but their ATP response is diminished.  We propose that ATP acts as an extracellular signal released by mechanostimulation in roots and that ATP binds a cell surface receptor that is coupled to calcium mobilization via the heterotrimeric G protein complex.</div>

<div>Drought causes severe damage and reduced yields for crops. The phytohormone, abscisic acid &#40;ABA&#41;, plays an essential role in protection of plants from a variety of environmental stresses such as drought, salt, and cold. Guard cells are responsible for controlling CO2 uptake and water loss by regulating the size of stomatal pores. During drought stress, a rapid response of a plant is to close stomatal pores. This process is mediated by ABA.  In stomatal guard cells, reactive oxygen species &#40;ROS&#41; have been suggested to function in ABA signaling. Despite extensive studies, molecular components working downstream of ROS in ABA signaling remain to be elucidated.  In order to identify and characterize MAPK cascades mediating guard cell ABA&#47;ROS signaling, we identified two MAPK genes, GCMAPK3 and GCMAPK4, that are preferentially and highly expressed in guard cells. To provide direct genetic evidence, RNAi&#45;based gene silencing plant lines were generated in which both genes are silenced. In parallel, Arabidopsis single and double mutants carrying deleterious point mutations in these genes were identified. Interestingly, ABA&#45;induced stomatal closure was strongly impaired in the RNAi lines in which both GCMAPK3 and GCMAPK4 transcripts were significantly silenced. Consistent with this result, the Arabidopsis mutants carrying point mutations in both genes showed an enhanced transpirational water loss and a strong ABA&#45;insensitive response in stomatal movement assays, whereas mutants carrying a mutation in one of these genes did not show any altered phenotype. Together, these results provide genetic evidence that GCMAPK3 and GCMAPK4 function in guard cell ABA signaling, and there is functional redundancy in these genes. Currently, we are trying to further determine functional contribution of these genes to the ABA&#47;ROS signaling and stress response network. </div>

<div>The modulation of growth rate in response to environmental cues such as nutrient availability or stresses is essential for survival. The central function of the conserved eukaryotic TOR kinase is to promote cell growth and repress autophagy of cellular constituents in response to growth factors or favorable conditions. In animal and yeast cells, the TOR signalling pathway is now starting to be well known and has links with mitogens and growth&#45;promoting factors signalling pathways. Plants, unlike animals, have a plastic and undetermined organ growth which is tightly controlled by exogenous information. However, little is known so far on how this information is perceived and transduced into coherent growth and developmental decisions. The <span style="font-style: italic">Arabidopsis</span> TOR kinase &#40;AtTOR&#41; is essential for embryo development but its precise role remains to be established. Here we show that plant vegetative and reproductive growth is positively correlated with the level of expression of the AtTOR kinase. AtTOR kinase regulates plant cell size and cell number and the accumulation of biomass. The level of expression of the <span style="font-style: italic">AtTOR</span> gene is also correlated with the plant tolerance to osmotic stresses. Downregulation of <span style="font-style: italic">AtTOR</span> by constitutive or inducible RNAi led to a post&#45;germinative halt in plant growth, to reduced growth in the vegetative phase and to early senescence. Plants with partial silenced <span style="font-style: italic">AtTOR</span> expression also showed a marked reduction in the amount of polysomes. We conclude that the AtTOR kinase is one of the main contributors to the link between environmental cues and growth processes in plants. Therefore the manipulation of the <span style="font-style: italic">AtTOR</span> expression and signalling pathway could be of importance for improving plant biomass production. &#13;<br/>&#13;<br/>&#167; coauthor</div>

<div>Selective turnover of proteins through the ubiquitin&#45;proteasome pathway regulates diverse processes during plant development in response to internal and &#47;or external stimuli. Protein targeting with ubiquitin &#40;Ub&#41; requires the sequential activity of the E1, the E2 and the ubiquitin&#45;ligase or E3 enzymes. The SCF is an E3 multisubunit complex composed of four proteins, Cullin1, RBX, ASK1 and an F&#45;box protein. The F&#45;box proteins are the subunits responsible for specific recognition of the target. In silico analyses have identified more than seven hundred F&#45;box proteins in Arabidopsis, although it is still unclear whether all of them are part of functional SCF complexes. In this work we show that SKP2A, an F&#45;box protein forms an active SCF in vivo that has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. SKP2A gene is regulated at the transcriptional level and the SKP2A protein is degraded through the ubiquitin pathway. Interestingly, this proteolysis is accelerated in response to auxin. We also found that SKP2A participates in the control of cell division, regulating the activity of transcription factor E2FC&#45;DPB. Overexpression of SKP2A increased the number of dividing cells in root and shoot meristems and also the number of lateral roots, likely by reducing the levels of E2FC and DPB proteins, which acts as a repressor of cell division.&#13;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an attempt to identify more SCF&#45;SKP2A targets, we are conducting a proteomic approach. We are carrying out 2D liquid electrophoresis and comparing  wt and SKP2A&#45;overexpressing protein extracts in the presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132. So far, we are identified several proteins that are up&#45;regulated in the overexpressor plants and several that are more represented in wt plants. This lower amount in wt plants might be the consequence of a down&#45;regulation of gene expression or a faster degradation of the proteins by the SCF&#45;SKP2A. At present, we are trying to get the identity of these proteins by LC&#45;MS and determinate whether or not they are targets of the SCF&#45;SKP2A complex. These and further results will be presented at the meeting.&#13;<br/></div>

<div>The seedling triple&#45;response phenotype has been used for the analysis of ethylene responses in Arabidopsis and for the isolation of ethylene response mutants. However, it appears that no more new mutant can be isolated based on the seedling triple&#45;response phenotype, probably due to the saturation of genetic screen. Here we report that using a weak ctr1 &#40;Constitutive Triple Response 1&#41; mutant, we were able to isolate mutants that enhance or suppress the ctr1 mutant phenotype. The ecr &#40;Enhancer of CTR1&#41; mutation elevates the ctr1 mutant phenotype and the ecr ctr1 double mutant exhibits severe inhibition in the hypocotyl elongation in etiolated seedling and the rosette growth is largely inhibited when grown in the air. The rcr &#40;Reverser of CTR1&#41; mutation substantially restores the ctr1 mutant growth and the rcr ctr1 double mutant exhibits a long seedling hypocotyl and root growth in the air. In the adult stage, crc ctr1 phenotypically resembles weak ctr1 mutant. When germinated in ethylene, the rcr ctr1 seedling is short but exhibits root growth and has no apical hook. Genetic analyses for the ecr and rcr mutants are now in progress. Preliminary data suggest that the ecr mutant phenotype is dependent on the ctr1 mutation, implying an ethylene signal transduction pathway in parallel to or independent of CTR1.</div>

<div>The gaseous hormone ethylene plays an important role in plant growth and development and responses to environmental stresses. We have uncovered a negative regulator of ethylene responses that acts by positively regulating ETR1 ethylene receptor function in Arabidopsis. Arabidopsis has five ethylene receptors, which exhibit functional redundancy and negatively regulate ethylene responses. In a genetic screen for suppressors of the dominant ethylene&#45;insensitive receptor mutant <span style="font-style: italic">etr1&#45;2</span>, we identified <span style="font-style: italic">REVERSION&#45;TO&#45;ETHYLENE&#8211;SENSITIVITY1</span> &#40;<span style="font-style: italic">RTE1</span>&#41;, which encodes a novel integral membrane protein found in plants, animals and protists. The <span style="font-style: italic">rte1</span> null mutant displays ethylene hypersensitivity, which appears to be caused by reduced <span style="font-style: italic">ETR1</span> function, whereas over&#45;expression of <span style="font-style: italic">RTE1</span> confers ethylene insensitivity that is largely dependent on <span style="font-style: italic">ETR1</span>. Interestingly, loss of <span style="font-style: italic">rte1</span> function can suppress only certain <span style="font-style: italic">etr1</span> dominant alleles; 7 alleles were suppressed out of 13 <span style="font-style: italic">etr1</span> alleles tested, suggesting that RTE1 and ETR1 interact at the protein level. The other four ethylene receptors do not appear to be affected by <span style="font-style: italic">rte1</span>. A functional version of RFP&#45;tagged RTE1, expressed under the native <span style="font-style: italic">RTE1</span> promoter, localizes to the ER and Golgi, and shows partial co&#45;localization with CFP&#45;tagged ETR1. Preliminary biochemical data suggests that RTE1 can interact with ETR1 in living plant cells.</div>

<div>The current best candidates for <span style="font-style: italic">Arabidopsis thaliana</span> clock components are CCA1 &#40;CIRCADIAN CLOCK&#45;ASSOCIATED 1&#41; and its homolog LHY &#40;LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL&#41;. In addition, five members of a small family, PSEUDO&#45;RESPONSE REGULATORS &#40;including PRR1,PRR3,PRR5,PRR7, and PRR9&#41;, are believed to be another type of clock component. The originally described member of PRRs is TOC1 &#40;or PRR1&#41; &#40;TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1&#41;. Interestingly, seedlings of <span style="font-style: italic">A. thaliana</span> carrying a certain lesion &#40;i.e., loss&#45;of&#45;function or misexpression&#41; of a given clock&#45;associated gene commonly display a characteristic phenotype of light response during early photomorphogenesis. For instance, <span style="font-style: italic">cca1 lhy</span> double mutant seedlings show a shorter hypocotyl length than the wild type under a given fluence rate of red light. In contrast, both <span style="font-style: italic">toc1</span> single and <span style="font-style: italic">prr7 prr5</span> double mutant seedlings with longer hypocotyls are hyposensitive under the same conditions. These phenotypes are indicative of linkage between the circadian clock and red light&#45;signal transduction mechanisms. Here this issue was addressed by conducting combinatorial genetic and epistatic analyses with a large number of mutants and transgenic lines carrying lesions in clock&#45;associated genes, including a <span style="font-style: italic">cca1 lhy toc1</span> triple mutant and a <span style="font-style: italic">cca1 lhy prr7 prr5</span> quadruple mutant. Taking these results together, we propose a genetic model for clock&#45;associated red light signaling, in which CCA1 and LHY function upstream of TOC1&#40;PRR1&#41; in a negative manner, in turn, TOC1&#40;PRR1&#41; serves as a positive regulator. PRR7 and PRR5 also act as positive regulators, but independently from TOC1&#40;PRR1&#41;. It is further suggested that these signaling pathways are coordinately integrated into the phytochrome&#45;mediated red light signal transduction pathway, in which PIF3 &#40;PHYTOCHROME&#45;INTERACTING FACTOR 3&#41; functions as a negative regulator immediately downstream of phyB.</div>

<div>Calmodulin &#40;CaM&#41;, acting as a kind of receptor of Ca2&#43;, plays a central role in the Ca2&#43; signal transduction.  Through its downstream target, such as calmodulin&#45;binding protein &#40;CaMBP&#41;, CaM regulates cell physiology.  Therefore functional characterization of CaMBP is essential to reveal CaM signaling.  We have been carrying out phenotypic characterization of two T&#45;DNA insertion lines of the IQM1 gene available in the Salk T&#45;DNA library.  The IQM1 gene consists of 9 exons, and its product contains an IQ motif to which CaM possibly binds in the absence of calcium ion.  Using the yeast two&#45;hybrid system, IQM1 was demonstrated to bind with CaM2, which is one of 9 typical CaMs in Arabidopsis.  RT&#45;PCR analyses showed that the IQM1 mRNA was not transcribed downstream of the T&#45;DNA insertion site in either mutant.  Higher concentrations of auxin inhibit root hair formation in wild type.  However, root hair formation was not inhibited in iqm1 as readily as in wild type.  Staining pattern of the IQM1 promoter&#45;GUS lines showed that IQM1 strongly expressed in the cortex of the differentiation zone of roots.  The GUS staining was also observed in guard cells and trichomes of leaves.  Both RT&#45;PCR analysis and the GUS staining showed that IQM1 was a light&#45;inducible gene.  In addition, IQM1 was strongly induced by treatment with dehydration or NaCl when Arabidopsis was grown in the dark condition.  The present results suggest that IQM1 is involved in adaptation to the environmental changes as well as differentiation of epidermal cells, both of which may require CaM signaling.&#13;<br/>&#13;<br/>&#42;This work was supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China &#40;30570151&#41;. &#13;<br/>&#182;These authors contribute to this work equally. &#13;<br/></div>

<div>Calmodulin &#40;CaM&#41;, a ubiquitous calcium&#45;binding protein, regulates diverse cellular functions by modulating the activity of a variety of enzymes or proteins. However, direct regulation of transcription factors by Ca2&#43;&#47;CaM has been poorly understood. By screening of the Arabidopsis cDNA expression library with HRP conjugated calmodulin as a probe, we identified calmodulin binding NAC&#45;like protein, designated CBNAC. By using truncated versions of fusion proteins of CBNAC, we identified a Ca2&#43;&#45;dependent CaM binding domain &#40;CaMBD&#41; in the C&#45;terminus. Specific binding of CaM to CaMBD was corroborated by site direct mutagenesis and split&#45;ubiquitin assay. To determine the specific DNA sequence necessary for CBNAC binding, we employed a PCR&#45;mediated random binding site selection method. This analysis showed that CBNAC binding to DNA requires the GCTT core sequence and other specific sequences immediately flanking both ends of the GCTT motif. Actually, CBNAC was able to bind the identified consensus sequence and repress the activity of transcription in Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts. Interestingly, the transcriptional repression mediated by CBNAC was enhanced by CaM. These results suggest that CBNAC is a CaM regulated transcriptional repressor in Arabidopsis.</div>

<div>The phytochrome family of red&#47;far&#45;red photoreceptors regulates a variety of developmental processes throughout the life cycle of plants. Among the five phytochromes in <span style="font-style: italic">Arabidopsis</span>, phytochrome A &#40;phyA&#41; is the key photoreceptor for response to high irradiance far&#45;red &#40;FR&#41; light. FHY1 &#40;far&#45;red elongated hypocotyl 1&#41;, which is a positive regulator in phyA pathway, has been shown to interact with phyA by in vitro pull&#45;down assays.  Here we report that FHY1 protein becomes phosphorylated rapidly after exposure of the <span style="font-style: italic">Arabidopsis</span> seedlings to red light; and this process is dependent on the Pfr form of phyA. Furthermore, we demonstrate the FHY1&#45;phyA interaction by both bimolecular fluorescence complementation &#40;BIFC&#41; assays in living onion cells and co&#45;immunoprecipitation experiments in <span style="font-style: italic">Arabidopsis</span> seedlings. FHL, an FHY1 homolog protein that shares overlapping functions with FHY1, was also shown to interact with phyA in vivo in a similar manner. Therefore, our results suggest that interaction between phyA and FHY1 as well as phyA&#45;induced phosphorylation of FHY1 are important molecular events in mediating light signaling process. </div>

<div>Calmodulin &#40;CaM&#41;, a Ca2&#43; sensor in all eukaryotes, is known to be involved in the induction of defense responses in plants. However, the molecular targets of CaM are not well known. To elucidate the components in the CaM&#45;mediated defense signal pathway, we screened an Arabidopsis expression library with a horseradish&#45;peroxidase &#40;HRP&#41;&#45;conjugated CaM probe. Here we identified a CaM&#45;binding protein containing a Toll&#47;IL&#45;1 receptor &#40;TIR&#41; homology domain, denoted AtCBP54 &#40;for Arabidopsis thaliana calmodulin&#45;binding protein 54kD&#41;. Using domain mapping and CaM overlay assay, we identified a Ca2&#43;&#45;dependent CaM binding domain in the C&#45;terminal region of AtCBP54. The specific interaction of CaM with the CaM binding domain was confirmed by a gel mobility shift assay, a competition assay using a Ca2&#43;&#47;CaM&#45;dependent enzyme, site&#45;directed mutagenesis and a split ubiquitin assay system. By semi&#45;quantitative RT&#45;PCR, we detected AtCBP54 transcripts in rosette leaves, cauline leaves and stem, but not in flower and siliques. Interestingly, AtCBP54 was highly induced by not only virulence and avirulence bacterial pathogens, but also salicylic acid and jasmonic acid. These expression patterns of AtCBP54 suggest that AtCBP54 may play an important role in the pathogen signaling pathway. By yeast two&#45;hybrid screening, we have identified the AtCBP54&#45;binding protein &#40;AtCBP54BP&#41; that shows strong homology to shikimate kinase. We also find that the interaction of AtCBP54 with CaM induces the binding activity of AtCBP54BP with AtCBP54. Our study suggests that AtCBP54 may be involved in the pathogen signaling pathway through the interaction with shikimate kinase.</div>

<div>The heterotrimeric G&#45;proteins modulate cell division in diverse eukaryotes. Compared to vertebrates, the simpler repertoire of G&#45;protein complex and accessory components in Arabidopsis offers a unique advantage over all other multicellular, genetic&#45;model systems for dissecting the mechanism of the action of G&#45;proteins in cell proliferation. Loss&#45;of&#45;function mutants of Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G&#45;protein a subunit &#40;GPA1&#41; display defects in cell division throughout development.  Hormone sensitivity assays suggest that heterotrimeric G&#45;proteins may have a role in brassinosteroid &#40;BR&#41;&#45;mediated pathways.  Here we use Arabidopsis hypocotyl as a model system to dissect the role of GPA1 and BR receptor BRI1 in cell division.  We provide genetic evidence that GPA1 acts independently of BRI1 in the regulation of cell division in hypocotyl epidermal cells.  Loss&#45;of&#45;function mutants of <span style="font-style: italic">GPA1</span> &#40;<span style="font-style: italic">gpa1&#45;2</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">gpa1&#45;4</span>&#41;, weak mutant allele of <span style="font-style: italic">BRI1</span> &#40;<span style="font-style: italic">bri1&#45;5</span>&#41;, and BR biosynthesis mutant <span style="font-style: italic">det2&#45;1</span> all have short hypocotyls.  However, we found that the short hypocotyl of gpa1 mutants is largely due to a reduction in cell division, whereas the short hypocotyls of <span style="font-style: italic">bri1&#45;5</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">det2&#45;1</span> mutants are due to reductions in both cell elongation and cell division.  An additive effect on the reduction of cell division was found in <span style="font-style: italic">gpa1&#45;2 bri1&#45;5</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">gpa1&#45;4 det2&#45;1</span> double mutants when compared with <span style="font-style: italic">bri1&#45;5</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">det2&#45;1</span> single mutants.

<div>Nonspecific lipid transfer proteins are a type of widely distributed small proteins in plants. It is cystein&#45;rich, basic and extracellular. A rice nonspecific lipid transfer protein LTP144 was shown to be located in the cell wall and associated with the cell membrane simultaneously when visualized by the fluorescence of GFP in fusion with the protein. The cell membrane association mechanism was studied further using <span style="font-style: italic">E.Coli</span> expressed active protein Trx&#45;nsLTP144 as binding ligand in the membrane affinity&#45;binding assay. The radioactive 125I labeled Trx&#45;nsLTP144 can bind to rice plasma membranes with an apparent Kd of 16nM and Bmax of 190fmol&#47;mg proteins. The competition experiment results indicated that the membrane binding activity of Trx&#45;nsLTP144 was specific, which can be competed by cold Trx&#45;nsLTP, but cannot be competed by the fusion tag Thioredoxin. Protease treatment of the plasma membranes can abolish the binding but glycosidase cannot, suggesting that nsLTP144 can bind to a membrane protein. Cross&#45;linking agent BS3 could cross&#45;link 125I&#45;nsLTP144 with the plasma membrane receptor. After SDS&#45;polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography, one putative protein receptor on the rice plasma membrane with the molecular mass around 60 kDa was identified. The in vivo function of nsLTP144 was speculated based on the experiments.</div>

<div>Repression of photomorphogenesis in <span style="font-style: italic">Arabidopsis</span> requires activity of the COP9 signalosome &#40;CSN&#41;, CDD, and COP1 complexes, but how these three complexes work in concert to accomplish this important developmental switch has remained unknown. Here we demonstrate that <span style="font-style: italic">Arabidopsis</span> cullin 4 &#40;CUL4&#41; associates with the CDD complex and a common catalytic subunit RBX1 to form an active E3 ubiquitin ligase both <span style="font-style: italic">in vivo</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">in vitro</span>. The partial loss&#45;of&#45;function of CUL4 resulted in a constitutive photomorphogenic phenotype in respect to morphogenesis and light regulated gene expression. Further, CUL4 exhibits a synergistic genetic interaction with COP10 and DET1. Therefore this CUL4&#45;based E3 ligase is essential for the repression of photomorphogenesis. This CUL4&#45;based E3 ligase appears to physically associate with COP1 E3 ligase and positively regulates COP1&#45;dependent degradation of photomorphogenesis&#45;promoting transcription factors, while the CSN controls biochemical modification of CUL4 essential for E3 activity. This study thus suggests a biochemical activity connection between CSN and CDD complexes in their cooperation with COP1 in orchestrating the repression of photomorphogenesis.</div>

<div>A number of genes, encoding chitinase&#45;like protein &#40;called the CTL group&#41; have been identified from Arabidopsis, rice, cotton and pea. Members of the CTL group exhibit high similarity to those of glycoside hydrolase &#40;GH&#41; 19 family, in which most of plant chitinases are assigned, but the proteins have novel consensus sequences that were previously thought to be essential for chitinase activity. The genome of Arabidopsis is shown to contain two homologous genes, AtCTL1 and AtCTL2, sharing more than 62&#37; similarity in the amino acid sequence level. There are also common in genomic structures between two homologues. Such as number of exon and insertional position of intron. The hot2 mutant is the result of a missense mutation in AtCTL1 and exhibits multiple defects in development and response to abiotic stresses. RNA blot analysis showed that AtCTL2 transcripts are highly abundant in stem and repressed by wounding stress. Transgenic Arabidopsis with the b&#45;D&#45;glucuronidase gene driven by AtCTL2 promoter showed preferential GUS activity in stem, anther and stigma. To determine the physiological role of AtCTL2 in development and in response to abiotic stresses in plants, we will identify a T&#45;DNA insertion mutant of AtCTL2 and construct a double mutant of hot2&#45;2, T&#45;DNA insertion mutaton of AtCTL2.</div>

<div>Glucosamine &#40;GlcN&#41; is a naturally occurring amino&#45;sugar, enzymatically synthesized by the amidation of fructose&#45;6&#45;phosphate. Although a number of reports have shown the biological effect of GlcN on insulin resistance and immune activity in mammalian system, little is known about its physiological roles in plants. In this study, we found that exogenous treatment of GlcN causes repression of seedling growth and hypocotyl elongation in Arabidopsis. The addition of glucose, fructose, 6&#45;deoxy glucose, and 3&#45;O&#45;methyl glucose is capable of reversing these adverse effects of GlcN on hypocotyl elongation. Our results showed that GlcN is able to induce a significantly increase in production of reactive oxygen species and that the GlcN&#45;mediated inhibition of hypocotyl elongation is relieved by reducing agents, such as glutathione and ascorbic acid. Furthermore, mannoheptulose, a specific hexosekinase &#40;HXK&#41; inhibitor, was able to restore hypocotyl elongation in the presence of GlcN and gin2&#45;1 mutant plants exhibited less sensitivity to GlcN, compared with wild&#45;type plants. Whereas expression of glucose&#45;inducible genes, encoding chalcone synthase, beta&#45;amylase and chlorophyll binding a&#47;b protein remained unchanged on glucosamine treatment, level of ASN1 &#40;asparagine synthetase 1&#41; mRNA was down&#45;regulated by exogenous glucosamine as well as glucose. Taken together, these results provide evidence that GlcN causes oxidative stress represses through HXK&#45;dependent mechanism and affects gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana.</div>

The <span style="font-style: italic">rcd1</span> mutant is sensitive to apoplastic ROS, but more tolerant to chloroplastic ROS, has deficiencies in abscisic acid, ethylene, and methyl jasmonate regulated gene expression, overproduces nitric oxide, has constitutively more open stomata than the wild type, is slightly insensitive to glucose and is sensitive to salt. Two members of the plant&#45;specific RCD1 protein family, RCD1 and SRO1 &#40;Similar to RCD One 1&#41; contain a WWE&#45;domain for protein&#45;protein&#45;interactions and canonical nuclear localization sequences. In addition RCD1 and all SRO&#45;proteins have poly&#45;ADP&#45;ribosylase &#40;PARP&#41; core domain involved in NAD&#45;binding, and have a highly conserved C&#45;terminal domain that is involved in protein&#45;protein interactions. Nuclear localization resembling the distribution of active chromatin has been shown for RCD1. Furthermore, it has been shown that under salt and oxidative stress conditions RCD1 interacts with plasma membrane proteins. Yeast two&#45;hybrid analysis identified several RCD1 and SRO1&#45;interacting proteins, most of which are transcription factors related to salt and osmotic stress &#40;e.g., DREB2A&#41;, or carbohydrate&#45;regulation of gene expression. According to yeast 2&#45;hybrid analyses, in addition to their interaction with transcription factors, RCD1 can interact with itself, and also with SRO1. Only the <span style="font-style: italic">rcd1</span> mutant has a pleiotropic phenotype whereas no phenotypes have been found for the <span style="font-style: italic">sro1</span> mutant. However, the <span style="font-style: italic">rcd1 sro1</span> double mutant is unviable when grown in soil and can barely grow under <span style="font-style: italic">in vitro</span> conditions. Thus, both RCD1 and SRO1 seem to be involved in processes that affect interplay between hormonal signaling cascades, acclimatization to oxidative stress and salt and osmotic stress, and are required for the proper growth and development of the plant.</div>

<div>Response regulators are part of a multi&#45;component phosphorelay system and are implicated in playing pivotal roles in modulating plant responses to critical environmental signals such as cytokinin and ethylene. ARR22 &#40;At3g04280&#41; is an atypical response regulator gene, whose function in Arabidopsis thaliana is unknown. Time course RT&#45;PCR and Northern blot hybridization analysis reveal transcripts of ARR22 pre&#45;dominantly in reproductive organs &#40;Gattolin et al., 2006&#41;. Furthermore, &#946;&#45;glucuronidase &#40;GUS&#41; reporter gene expression driven by ARR22 promoter &#40;ARR22::GUS&#41; is specifically localized at the seed:funiculus junction. However, GUS activity is primarily visible when pods or seeds are mechanically wounded. Promoter analyses have shown no indication that the 183bp 5&#8217;UTR intron regulates the wound inducibility of ARR22. Over&#45;expression of ARR22 using the constitutive 35SCaMV promoter resulted in extreme dwarf transgenic phenotypes. ARR22 knock&#45;out &#40;KO&#41;transgenic lines are phenotypically indistinguishable from wild type individuals under the conditions studied. Double knock&#45;out lines of ARR22 and ARR24 are also similar to wild&#45;type plants and whilst these two genes exhibit 66&#37; amino acid similarity there is no evidence that they are functional homologous. Microarray approach has been followed to identify ARR22 co&#45;regulated genes during pod development. ARRE is another gene having 75&#37; amino&#45;acid sequence similarity to ARR22 but which is structurally highly divergent, having two possible open reading frames. The two open reading frames were over&#45;expressed separately using the constitutive 35SCaMV promoter. Homozygous 35S::ARRE transgenic lines have similar phenotypic characteristics to wild&#45;type individuals. &#13;<br/>&#13;<br/>Gattolin S, Alandete&#45;Saez M, Elliott K, Gonzalez&#45;Carranza Z, Naomab E, Powell C, Roberts JA &#40;2006&#41; Spatial and temporal expression of the response regulators ARR22 and ARR24 in Arabidopsis thaliana.

<div>De &#40;Defective endosperm&#41;&#45;B30 is a dominant mutation in a gene, encoding 19&#45;kD  &#45;Zein in maize that causes an opaque kernel phenotype with enhanced level of binding protein. The alteration of serine to proline at position 15 in a  &#45;Zein gene would cause a defective signal peptide cleavage and high induction of binding protein and other chaperones in the endoplasmic reticulum. To determine the effect of overexpression of De&#45;B30 on UPR stress in Arabidopsis, we have constructed and performed characterization of transgenic Arabidopsis plants with a gene, encoding  &#45;Zein protein15P under 35S CaMV promoter. The transgenic plants exhibit defects in early growth in the light and inhibition of hypocotyl elongation in the dark. However, the immunoblotting and Northern analyses showed no induction of binding protein and calreticulin in transgenic plants, unlike as shown in De&#45;B30 maize kernel. Several proteins including S&#45;glutathion transferase &#40;GST&#41;1 and Malate&#47;lactode dehydrogenase, were found to be up&#45;regulated more than 2&#45;fold in transgenic plants with overexpression of De&#45;B30 gene versus vector control in the proteomic analysis. However, Northern blot analysis revealed that only GST1 gene was more abundantly expressed in transgenic plants. In addition to the up&#45;regulation of S&#45;glutathion transferase gene, the endogenous production of reactive oxygen species was also confirmed by 3,3'&#45;diaminobenzidine &#40;DAB&#41;&#45;staining. Our findings suggest the possibility of involvement of ROS upon endoplasmic reticulum stress in Arabidopsis. </div>

<div>There are eleven ROPs &#40;Rho&#45;like GTPases in plants&#41; in Arabidopsis, which comprise a novel and diverse functioning set of genes important in many signaling pathways in plants including responses to hormones &#40;ABA, BR and auxin&#41;, responses to biotic and abiotic stresses &#40;e.g., hypoxia and nutrient deficiency&#41;, and developmental process like cell polarity and morphogenesis. There is strong sequence identity &#40;&#62;70&#37;&#41; and functional redundancy and overlaps among members of the ROP family, so it is important to confer multiple mutations to bring about an observable phenotype. We chose three ROPs that comprise a functionally redundant group and constructed a <span style="font-style: italic">rop4&#45;1 rop6&#45;1</span> double mutant into which a <span style="font-style: italic">rop2</span> RNAi construct was stably transformed, in the ecotype Wassilewskija. The triple mutant appears to have defects in seed production as well as an increase in rosette leaf senescence. We also performed Affymetrix gene chip experiments using the triple mutant to see if any of the apparent phenotypes could be explained by changes in gene expression. We found that genes associated with stress and senescence are up&#45;regulated in the triple mutant compared to the wild&#45;type and that these genes are primarily expressed in the adult leaves, callus, pollen and radicle. It is interesting to note that the genes up&#45;regulated in only the adult leaves are related to defense response, stress response, signal transduction, electron transport, and secondary metabolism which may contribute to the observed triple mutant phenotype.</div>

<div>Auxin affects a large number of important growth and developmental processes including of shoot and root branching in higher plants. Several recent results have shown that the polar auxin transport inhibitors such as N&#45;1&#45;naphthylphthalamic acid, 9&#45;hydroxyfluorene&#45;9&#45;carboxylic acid, and 2,3,5&#45;triiodobenzoic acid affect leaf growth and leaf vein morphology. To investigate possible role of LAF1 &#40;Long After Far&#45;red light 1&#41;, a R2R3 Myb transcription factor and a signal transducer of far&#45;red light, in auxin transport, we examined vein patterning of laf1 mutant. Analyses of leaf growth and leaf vein pattern of laf1 mutant showed that length of rosette leaf is shorter than wild type and midvein is much broader than wild type. In addition, number of secondary veins was decreased in laf1 mutant.  Besides, GUS assay revealed that LAF1 is specifically expressed in root, in particular in main root tip and lateral root, and its expression is induced by auxin NAA in roots. Moreover, transcript level of PIN3 &#40;PIN&#45;FORMED3&#41; encoding auxin carrier protein is decreased in laf1 mutant compared to that in wild type, which suggest that LAF1 may positively regulate expression of genes relating to auxin signaling through its transcriptional activity and auxin transport might be significantly blocked in laf1 mutant. Taken together, our results indicate that LAF1 involves in leaf and root developments as a positive regulator of auxin signaling. &#13;<br/>&#13;<br/>This work was supported by the Basic Research Program of the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation &#40;KOSEF&#41; grant funded by the Korea government &#40;MOST&#41; &#40;No. R01&#45;2006&#45;000&#45;10035&#45;0&#41; and supported by a grant from the Biogreen 21 program of Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea &#40;20050401&#45;034&#45;783&#45;175&#45;02&#45;00&#41;.&#13;<br/></div>

<div>The plant hormone jasmonic acid &#40;JA&#41; plays a key role in the environmental stress responses and developmental processes of plants. Although ATMYC2&#47;JIN1 is a major positive regulator of JA&#45;inducible gene expression and essential for JA&#45;dependent developmental processes in Arabidopsis, molecular mechanisms underlying the control of ATMYC2&#47;JIN1 expression remain largely unknown. Here, we identify a Mitogen&#45;Activated Protein kinase &#40;MAPK&#41; cascade, MAPK kinase 3 &#40;MKK3&#41;&#45;MAPK 6 &#40;MPK6&#41;, which is activated by JA in Arabidopsis. We also show that JA negatively controls ATMYC2&#47;JIN1 expression, based on quantitative RT&#45;PCR and genetic analyses using mutants of gain&#45;of&#45;function and loss&#45;of&#45;function of the MKK3&#45;MPK6 cascade. These results indicate that this kinase unit plays a key role in JA&#45;dependent negative regulation of ATMYC2&#47;JIN1 expression. Both positive and negative regulation by JA may be used for fine&#45;tuning ATMYC2&#47;JIN1 expression to control JA signaling. Moreover, JA&#45;regulated root growth inhibition is affected by mutations in the MKK3&#45;MPK6 cascade, which indicates important roles in JA signaling. We provide a model explaining how MPK6 can convert three distinct signals, JA, pathogen, and cold&#47;salt stress, into three different sets of responses in Arabidopsis.</div>

<div>Iron is an essential element for respiration, photosynthesis, and many other cellular functions. Iron deficiency and sufficiency are important limiting factors for crop production. Phosphatidylinositol &#40;PI&#41; metabolic pathway is involved in many signaling pathways, including light, hormone, calcium homeostasis, etc. However, it remains unknown whether PI pathway is associated with iron homeostasis. Here, we demonstrate a novel role for inositol polyphosphate 6&#45;&#47;3&#45;kinase gene &#40;<span style="font-style: italic">AtIpk2&#946;</span>&#41; in iron homeostasis. <span style="font-style: italic">AtIpk2&#946;</span> is an important kinase in PI pathway and  phosphorylates IP3 to IP4. Our experiments showed that <span style="font-style: italic">AtIpk2&#946;</span> was induced by both iron&#45;deficiency and &#8211;sufficiency stresses. T&#45;DNA insertion lines exhibited hyper&#45;responses to both iron&#45;deficiency and &#8211;sufficiency treatments compared to wild&#45;type, while the transgenic lines displayed hypo&#45;responses. Further research revealed that iron&#45;deficiency caused more reduction in root elongation in mutant lines; in contrast, longer roots were observed in transgenic lines. Elemental analysis showed that <span style="font-style: italic">atipk2&#946;</span> mutant lines decreased iron content, whereas the transgenic lines exhibited much higher iron content. Our work suggests a novel physiological function of <span style="font-style: italic">AtIpk2&#946;</span> in iron homeostasis. Substantial progresses will be presented and discussed.</div>

<div>Mitogen&#45;activated protein kinases &#40;MPKs&#41; control many kinds of signal transduction in all eukaryotic organisms.  MPKs are known to be inactivated by dual specificity MPK phosphatases &#40;DsPTPs&#41;. We previously isolated and reported a CaM&#45;binding dual&#45;specificity protein phosphatase1 &#40;DsPTP1&#41;. Dephosphorylation of pNPP, a common synthetic protein phosphatase substrate, by DsPTP1 was increased in the presence of CaM. However, tyrosine dephosphorylation activity of DsPTP1 on phosphorylated MBP was inhibited by CaM &#40;J. Biol. Chem. 279. 848&#45;858. 2004&#41;.  In this study, we found that DsPTP1 directly bound to MPK3, MPK4, and MPK6 using yeast two&#45;hybrid analysis and in vitro binding assay.  DsPTP1 dephosphorylated and inactivated MPK3, MPK4, and MPK6 phosphorylated by MEK1 and MEK2 in an enzyme concentration&#45;dependent manner.  Interestingly, the activity of DsPTP1 on phospho&#45;Tyr was inhibited by the addition of CaM, whereas activity on phospho&#45;Ser&#47;Thr was not affected against MPK3, MPK4, and MPK6 substrates phosphorylated by MEK1 and MEK2. This result implies that Ca2&#43; mediated signaling pathway can cross&#45;talk with MPKs signal pathway via DsPTP1 regulation.</div>

<div>Regulated RNA metabolism appears to be a critical component of molecular mechanisms directing flowering initiation in plants. A group of RNA&#45;binding proteins regulate flowering time through the autonomous flowering pathway. Posttranscriptional mechanisms exerted by microRNAs &#40;miRNAs&#41; also play a key role in flowering time control. Here, we show that the GIGANTEA &#40;GI&#41;&#45;controlled microRNA172 &#40;miR172&#41; defines a unique genetic pathway that regulates photoperiodic flowering by inducing FLOWERING LOCUS T &#40;FT&#41; independent of CONSTANS &#40;CO&#41;. A late flowering mutant in which a miR172 target gene TOE1 is activated by the nearby insertion of the CaMV 35S enhancer normally responded to vernalization and gibberellic acid &#40;GA&#41; treatments. In contrast, its response to daylength changes was severely disrupted. In the mutant, FT was significantly repressed, but other flowering genes were unaffected. Notably, miR172 abundance is regulated by photoperiod via GI in a CO&#45;independent manner. Accordingly, miR172&#45;overproducing plants exhibit early flowering both under long days and short days, even in the absence of functional CO, indicating that miR172 promotes photoperiodic flowering by inducing FT. Therefore, it appears that GI&#45;mediated photoperiodic flowering is governed by coordinate interaction of two distinct pathways: one mediated via CO and the other mediated via miR172 and its targets.</div>

<div>The ubiquitin pathway catalyzes covalent attachment of the 76&#45;amino acid ubiquitin, typically to epsilon amino groups of substrate proteins, and includes proteins that recognize and catabolize ubiquitylated proteins. Ubiquitylation can affect the activity, localization and&#47;or longevity of the substrate protein.  The ubiquitin E3 ligases play an important role in determining specificity of ubiquitylation by interacting with the E2 carrying activated ubiquitin and the substrate.  One type of E3 contains a conserved domain called a RING &#40;for Really Interesting New Gene&#41; domain that serves, in part, to interact with the E2. Bioinformatics searches of the predicted <span style="font-style: italic">Arabidopsis thaliana</span> proteome identified over 470 proteins with RING or RING&#45;like domains.  Our major goal is to identify the <span style="font-style: italic">in vivo</span> functions for selected RING and RING&#45;like type E3 ligases.  cDNAs were isolated and <span style="font-style: italic">in vitro</span> activity assays of recombinant proteins were used to determine whether RING proteins could function as E3 ligases.  Publicly available T&#45;DNA insertion lines in over 100 RING domain genes were propagated to isolate homozygous individuals that were subsequently subjected to phenotypic analyses. We have focused detailed studies on three different RING genes that are seedling lethal when the insertion is homozygous. Interacting partners for one group of RING proteins were identified by Y2H analyses and results verified by  <span style="font-style: italic">in vitro</span> interaction assays.  Altogether, these studies will identify new E3 ligases, their function and aid in our understanding of how ubiquitylation by E2 and RING E3 ligases is regulated.

<div>Brassinosteroids signaling is initiated by the activation of BR&#45;receptor complex consisting of two receptor&#45;like serine&#47;threonin kinases, BRI1 and BAK1 upon BL binding to the extracellular domain of BRI1. We isolated a putative bak1 suppressor from the bak1 transformed with activation&#45;tagging vector construct. As found in the T2 generation, it is loss&#45;of&#45;function T&#45;DNA insertional mutant showing longer leaf and petiole than bak1 mutant. We performed TAIL&#45;PCR analysis and identified the T&#45;DNA insertional site in the gene encoding one of the cytochrome P450 oxidases. This belongs to the CYP705 family in the 71 clan. So far, it has been reported 62 CYP families in plants. Among them CYP 705 family consisting of 25 individual members and 8 pseudogenes is specific in Brassicaceae. We searched the single mutant for this and observed any morphological differences. No noticeable phenotypic changes were occurred in single mutant compared with background ecotype, Ler. However, double mutant between this candidate gene and bak1 gave similar phenotypes appeared in original suppressor of bak1, confirmed that the suppressed phenotype of bak1 resulted from the loss of this CYP gene. We also did genetic crossed between putative suppressors with bri1&#45;9 mutant allele and analyzed F2 plants segregated. Few triple mutants which have two T&#45;DNA insertions in bak1 and suppressor genes, respectively and bri1&#45;9 mutation showed much weaker bri1&#45;301 phenotypes, indicating the lack of this suppressor gene make the severe bri1 plants partially rescued. Based on the GUS reporter gene expression, the expression of gene for bak1 suppressor was found in the root tip just above the columella, vascular strands, and hypocotyls of the very young seedlings. No positive signal was detected in the leaf primordia which is the sites for the highest expression of BAK1. </div>

We coupled the enrichment procedure to two&#45;dimensional gel electrophoresis &#91;3&#93;. Arabidopsis thaliana cell cultures are investigated in response to different treatments and differential in vivo phosphorylation of proteins. The data are assembled in ProMEX . ProMEX is a reference mass spectral library consisting of tryptic peptide product ion spectra generated by mass spectrometry and was developed using protein samples of Arabidopsis thaliana, Medicago truncatula, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, tomato and potato. An algorithm is implemented allowing for protein identification in uncharacterized samples. Protein identification based on the reference peptide mass spectra showed improved true positive rates as well as improved phosphoprotein detection compared to commercial algorithms. ProMEX integrates proteomics data with other levels of molecular organization including metabolite, pathway, and transcript information and may thus become a useful resource for plant systems biology studies.   &#13;<br/>&#13;<br/>References&#13;<br/>&#13;<br/>&#91;1&#93;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hummel, J., Niemann, M., Wienkoop, S., Schulze, W., Steinhauser, D., Selbig, J., Walther, D. and Weckwerth, W. &#40;2007&#41;.

<div>Plants use sophisticated strategies to balance responses to oxidative stress. Programmed cell death, including the hypersensitive response &#40;HR&#41; associated with successful pathogen recognition, is one cellular response regulated by reactive oxygen in various cellular contexts. The Arabidopsis basic leucine zipper &#40;bZIP&#41; transcription factor AtbZIP10 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and binds consensus G&#45; and C&#45;box DNA sequences. Surprisingly, AtbZIP10 can be retained outside the nucleus by LSD1, a protein that protects Arabidopsis cells from death in the face of oxidative stress signals. We demonstrate that AtbZIP10 is a positive mediator of the uncontrolled cell death observed in lsd1 mutants. AtbZIP10 and LSD1 act antagonistically in both pathogen&#45;induced HR and basal defense responses. LSD1 likely functions as a cellular hub, where its interaction with AtbZIP10 and additional, as yet unidentified, proteins contributes significantly to plant oxidative stress responses.&#13;<br/>&#13;<br/>EMBO J 25 &#40;18&#41;: 4400&#45;4411 SEP 20 2006</div>

<div>Guard cells consist of stomatal pores that are responsible for gas exchange and water transpiration in plants.  Thus, guard cell play an essential role for plant growth and development. Plants have developed complicated signaling mechanisms controlling stomatal opening and closing in response to changing envronments.  Abscisic acid &#40;ABA&#41; and Ca2&#43; are well&#45;studied signaling molecules which mediate stomatal closure. It was shown that Ca2&#43; signatures encode necessary information for stomatal closure.  The information in Ca2&#43; oscillations is encoded in amplitudes and frequencies that are regulated in part by cellular Ca2&#43; transporters.  Arabidopsis Ca2&#43;&#47;H&#43; transporters &#40;CAX&#41; are important antiporters that control intracellular Ca2&#43; levels. A single&#45;cell type functional genomics approach identified that two CAX genes are highly expressed in guard cells.  To investigate the role of these CAX genes in guard cell signaling, stomatal responses to various hormones and environmental cues were examined in the cax single and double mutants.  Furthermore, consistent with the stomatal response, seedling of the cax single and double mutants show that theses mutants are defective in the hormone signaling.  Our results suggest that CAX proteins play a central role in plant hormone signaling by contributing to the cellular hormone and Ca2&#43; homeostasis.  Further biochemical and physiological results will be discussed.</div>

<div>Our lab conducted a proteomic analysis of Arabidopsis root tips to identify proteins whose abundance and&#47;or modification change early in response to mechano&#45;stimulation. The study identified proteins with interesting temporal patterns of response to gravity and touch stimulation, and uncovered groups of differentially regulated proteins with clearly related functions that had not previously been implicated in gravity or touch signaling. We are using a combination of reverse genetics, temporal and spatial expression analysis in Arabidopsis, and transformation&#45;rescue experiments in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to  identify and characterize the potential role of one of these proteins, which we call SKU15, in mechano&#45;transduction.</div>

<div>Small GTP&#45;binding proteins serve as molecular switches to regulate different cellular processes. This study examined the effects of auxin on several mutated lines of Arabidopsis plants in which small G&#45;protein genes were disrupted by T&#45;DNA insertion. Salk mutant line was hypersensitive to auxin; however, this line contained an insertion in the RAB gene promoter. Since the Salk mutant line is not an RAB knock&#45;out mutant, another Salk mutant line that contains a T&#45;DNA insertion in the first exon of RAB was used for further studies. We found that RAB is responsive to auxin and plants that overexpress RAB exhibit hypersensitivity to auxin, due to the altered expression of auxin&#45;responsive genes. Transient expression of GFP fused with RAB in onion epidermis and in transgenic plants showed that RAB was expressed in the endosomes and cytoskeletal network in cytoplasm, suggesting that RAB might play a role in the regulation of polar auxin transport.  Taken together, these results show that RAB is an essential component of the pathway that couples auxin signaling to plant growth and development. &#13;<br/>&#13;<br/>&#13;<br/>This work was supported by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation &#40;KOSEF&#41; grant funded by the Korea government &#40;MOST&#41; &#40;to Hojoung Lee, grant &#35; R11&#45;2001&#45;092&#45;04004&#45;0&#41;</div>

<div>Cytosolic free Ca2&#43; plays crucial roles in the regulation of pollen germination and tube growth, but little is known about the downstream regulatory components of Ca2&#43; signaling pathways.  K&#43;&#45;uptake by a growing pollen tube is essential for pollen tube growth.  However, molecular mechanism of K&#43;&#45;channel regulation during pollen germination and tube growth remains unknown.  Here, we show that an Arabidopsis CDPK regulates pollen tube growth and K&#43; influx during pollen germination and tube growth.  Overexpression of this AtCPK significantly inhibited pollen tube growth, whereas pollen tubes of T&#45;DNA insertion mutant grew faster than that of wild type plants.  By conducting patch&#45;clamp whole&#45;cell recording with pollen and pollen tube protoplasts, we observed that increase of cytoplasmic &#91;Ca2&#43;&#93; from 10 nM to 10 mM significantly inhibited the inward K&#43; currents for wild type plants, whereas increase of cytoplasmic &#91;Ca2&#43;&#93; had no effect on the inward K&#43; currents for this AtCPK knock&#45;out mutants.  The results demonstrated that this AtCPK, may mediate regulation of K&#43; influx by cytoplasmic &#91;Ca2&#43;&#93; changes and consequently regulates pollen germination and tube growth.</div>

<div>Brassinosteroids &#40;BRs&#41; are a special class of plant steroid hormones that are essential for normal growth and development processes. Assessment of genes involvement in BRs biosynthesis and perception reveals that there are numbers of genes showing their role in BRs signaling. We have screened the activation tagged mutant that having remarkable phenotypic difference and responding with an active BRs biosynthetic inhibitor, brassinazole &#40;Brz&#41;. The mutant was taller, late flowering, dark green, containing rounded leaves and had fewer seeds. TAIL&#45;PCR, genotyping PCR and segregation ratio of T2 plants had shown a single T&#45;DNA insertion at the first exon of Cleavage Polyadenylation Specific Factor &#40;<span style="font-style: italic">CPSF</span>&#41; gene in chromosome III that encodes a 130 kD protein having functional homologue with the specific mRNA splicing factor exhibiting a Brz resistant mutant.

<div>Cytokinins have many critical functions in plants, such as cell proliferation, shoot formation, nutrient relocation, shoot branching, and longevity control as a &#8220;master regulator&#8221; of plant growth and development. In Arabidopsis, cytokinin signal is known to be initiated by the three cytokinin receptors, AHK2, AHK3, and AHK4&#47;CRE1&#47;WOL, with the structural features of hybrid histidine kinases, and transduced to downstream response regulators via a His&#45;to&#45;Asp phosphorelay cascade. &#13;<br/>For better understanding of cytokinin signaling, we have been trying to see cytokinin signaling at a systems level and with a dynamic view. We are constructing dynamic regulatory networks among cytokinin response regulators. The Arabidopsis genome has 22 genes for response regulators, which are grouped into two classes, type&#45;A Arabidopsis Response Regulator &#40;ARR&#41; and type&#45;B ARR. While the type&#45;A ARR genes have been examined for cytokinin inducibility, type&#45;B ARRs are not induced by cytokinins. It has been suggested that the type&#45;B ARRs might function as transcription factors. By examining the expression of type&#45;A ARR genes in ARR1, ARR2, and ARR10 overexpression lines, we found that these type&#45;A ARR genes are differentially regulated by type&#45;B ARR proteins at the transcriptional level. We also have been generating constitutive and inducible overexpression lines for these response regulators and observing the noticeable phenotypes. Based on the phenotypes, we will construct transcriptional regulatory network in the specific organ. Through this systemic approach, we will get the significant advances in understanding cytokinin signaling in Arabidopsis.&#13;<br/></div>

<div>Post&#45;translational modification is a major mechanism by which peptides undergo specific structural changes at certain residues that confer special functions to the molecule. In particular, tyrosine sulfation is one of the common post&#45;translational modifications of proteins secreted through the trans&#45;Golgi network. Phytosulfokine &#40;PSK&#41; is a 5&#45;amino&#45;acid tyrosine&#45;sulfated peptide that has been identified in the medium of plant cell cultures, based on the results of assays of growth&#45;promoting activity of cultured cells. Overexpression of <span style="font-style: italic">PSK</span> or direct treatment of seedlings with PSK peptide stimulates plant growth by promoting cell division and expansion. Genes encoding PSK precursors are expressed at considerable level in a variety of tissues throughout plant life cycle. The PSK receptor PSKR1 was purified from microsomal fractions of carrot cells by ligand&#45;based affinity chromatography and identified as a member of leucine&#45;rich repeat receptor kinase &#40;LRR&#45;RK&#41;.

<div>Light is a crucial environment signal that controls many photomorphogenic and circadian responses in plants. This light information is first perceived various photoreceptors, which transmit the light information to light&#45;dependent downstream responses. In higher plants, three photoreceptor systems have been reported : the red and far&#45;red light&#45;absorbing phytochromes, the UV&#45;A&#47;blue light&#45;absorbing cryptochromes &#47; phototrophins, and the as&#45;yet unidentified UV&#45;B light&#45;absorbing receptors. To transmit the responsive light information properly, plants have evolved a set of signaling components that assess and relay the nature of the incident signals to the changes of gene expression that control responses in growth and development. Since protein&#45;protein interactions are fundamental to all cellular signaling processes, we tried to find photoreceptor&#45;interacting proteins using various methods, and identified several authentic proteins. &#13;<br/>We identified PAPP5 by yeast two&#45;hybrid screening of phytochrome&#45;interacting proteins. It specifically dephosphorylates Pfr&#45;phytochromes and enhances phytochrome&#45;mediated photoresponses. Depending on the specific serine residues dephosphorylated by PAPP5, phytochrome stability and affinity for a downstream signal transducer, NDPK2, were enhanced. Another intriguing protein is BIT1. It activates blue light induced gene expression through Cryptochrome1. CRY1 directly bind to BIT1 and controls the transcriptional activity of BIT1. And we isolated the 149 phyB&#45;interactomes that form during different light conditions in a phyB&#45;overexpressing transgenic Arabidopsis line by a one&#45;step co&#45;IP method. we study the possibility of these proteins function as the immediate controller, transducer and responser in the light signaling pathway.&#13;<br/></div>

<div>Brassinosteroids &#40;BRs&#41; stimulate plant growth through a receptor kinase&#45;mediated signaling pathway. Contrast to the conventional BR dwarf phenotypes, tall plant stature can be induced due to a gain&#45;of&#45;funtion mutation in a gene for positive regulator or a loss&#45;of&#45;function mutation in a negative regulator in BR signaling pathways. We obtained a list of long hypocotyl mutants from Arabidopsis Biological Resources Center &#40;ABRC&#41;, and made double mutants with a BR biosynthetic mutant dwf7&#45;1. Among the mutants tested, elongated&#45;D &#40;elg&#45;D&#41; caused a significant suppression of a dwarf phenotype seen in dwf7&#45;1. Thus, we hypothesized that elongated&#45;D has a dominant mutation in one of the BR signaling components. Using a map&#45;based cloning method, we identified that ELG encodes for BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1&#45;ASSOCIATED KINASE1 &#40;BAK1&#41;. The elg&#45;D mutation caused a substitution of Asp at the 123th amino acid residue for Ile, which is located in an extracellular Leucine&#45;rich repeat domain of BAK1. To further understand the effect of this mutation, we introduced the elg&#45;D mutation into BR signaling mutants including bri1&#45;5, bin2&#45;1D&#47;dwf12&#45;1D, bzr1&#45;D, and bes1&#45;D through genetic crossing. elg&#45;D mutation suppressed the dwarfism of bri1&#45;5 more than three folds in the whole plant height. However, the level of suppression of the bin2&#45;1D&#47;dwf12&#45;1D mutant was about 30&#37; that of a single mutant, confirming that the bin2&#45;1D&#47;dwf12&#45;1D mutation is epistatic to the elg&#45;D. Currently, we hypothesize that the elg&#45;D mutation constitutively transmits signal even in an absence of brassinolide possibly due to structural change in the LRR domain into active form, which is normally shaped by brassinolide binding.</div>

<div>Oxylipins, lipid derivatives generated by oxygenation of fatty acids, function in signaling pathways related to various physiological and pathological responses in both plants and animals. It is known that a variety of plant oxylipins have antimicrobial effects, stimulate plant defense gene expression, and regulate plant growth and development. The most well&#45;characterized oxylipin in plants is the phytohormone jasmonic acid. This and other plant oxylipins are formed from the oxygenation of fatty acids, mainly linoleic acid and linolenic acid, by the action of lipoxygenases or a&#45;dioxygenases, followed by various secondary transformations. The expression of genes encoding these enzyme activities is specifically induced upon inoculation with plant pathogens, and alterations in the synthesis of oxylipins in mutants and transgenic lines have been shown to modify the plant response to pathogen infection. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We used a collection of pure oxylipins and an in vitro seedling assay to study the functionality of compounds in Arabidopsis. Seedlings grown in the presence of oxylipins showed three distinct phenotypic alterations: root waving with lateral root arrest, growth arrest with loss of root apical dominance, and overall decrease of root elongation. Results from studies with mutants impaired in these responses revealed that the root phenotypes observed were mediated by at least three distinct signalling pathways.  <br/>Further characterization of the response to 9&#45;hydroxyoctadecatrienoic acid &#40;9&#45;HOT&#41;, the strongest inducer of root waving, suggested a role for 9&#45;HOT, or a closely related 9&#45;lipoxygenase product, in the formation of lateral roots and defense against pathogens via effects on gene expression, callose and pectin deposition, and the production of reactive oxygen species. <br/></div>

<div>The auxin class of plant hormones, including the endogenous auxin IAA, are a relatively heterogeneous collection of molecules. These compounds regulate diverse aspects of plant growth and development by promoting the degradation of transcriptional regulators called Aux&#47;IAA proteins through the action of the ubiquitin protein ligase SCFTIR1. In recent work the F&#45;box protein subunit of SCFTIR1, a protein called TIR1, was shown to function as an auxin receptor. Auxin binds directly to TIR1 to promote binding of the Aux&#47;IAA proteins. Structural studies of the ASK1&#45;TIR1 complex indicate that auxin binding does not produce a conformational change in TIR1. Rather, auxin appears to function as a &#8216;molecular glue&#8221; to stabilize a weak interaction between TIR1 and the Aux&#47;IAA substrates. These studies also suggest how structurally diverse compounds function as auxins. In addition, genetic analysis of TIR1 and other members of the TIR1&#47;AFB auxin receptor family, provide new insight into the complexity of auxin signaling.</div>

<div>Abscisic acid &#40;ABA&#41; is an important hormone that mediates many aspects of plant growth and development, particularly in response to the environmental stresses. Several components involved in ABA response were identified, however, the ABA signaling pathways is not well defined. Recent reports revealed that the nuclear RNA&#45;binding protein FCA and the chloroplast protein Mg&#45;chelatase H subunit are ABA receptors, suggesting the existence of multiple ABA receptors in Arabidopsis. In addition, previous report verified that the only canonical heterotrimeric G protein &#945; subunit, GPA1, is involved in ABA&#45;mediated seed germination, stomata opening, and inward K&#43; channel in guard cell , suggesting that GPA1 is involved in ABA signaling pathway. Heterotrimeric G proteins coupled with a plasma membrane localized receptor to transduce the excellular signaling. In the present work, we characterized a putative G protein&#45;coupled receptor. We found that this receptor interacts with both GPA1 and AGB1 &#40;Arabidopsis G&#946; subunit&#41;, and the interaction between this receptor and GPA1 is dependent on the intrinsic GTPase activity of GPA1. We also observed that mutation in this receptor leads to the defects in ABA responses from seed germination, stomata clousure and opening to gene expression. This receptor specific binds to ABA, and the binding between the receptor and ABA follows receptor kinetics. Thus, our results revealed that this receptor is the plasma membrane receptor for ABA, and it mediates all major ANA response via heterotrimeric G proteins in Arabidopsis.</div>

<div>Inositol polyphosphate 5&#45;phosphatase &#40;5PTase&#41;, a key enzyme in phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway, plays critical roles in hormone signaling, cotyledon vein pattern formation, and secondary wall synthesis and actin organization in fiber cells. Our previous studies indicated the roles of At5PTase13, a WD40&#45;containing type II 5PTase, in hormone&#45;mediated cotyledon vein development, and here we further showed its involvement of blue light responses. Compared to the expression under dark, that of At5PTase13 is suppressed by blue light irradiation and deficiency of which results in shortened hypocotyls and expanded cotyledons. Further, At5PTase13 is significantly enhanced under deficiency of phototropins &#40;PHOTs&#41;, and suppressed At5PTase13 expression rescued the elongated hypocotyls of phot1 or phot1&#47;phot2 under blue light. Measurement of cytosolic Ca2&#43; concentrations &#40;&#91;Ca2&#43;&#93;cyt&#41; revealed the reduced or increased &#91;Ca2&#43;&#93;cyt under blue light irradiation in phot1 and at5pt13 seedlings respectively, demonstrating the role of At5PTase13 in mediating PHOT1 effects and &#91;Ca2&#43;&#93;cyt&#45;regulated hypocotyl elongation under blue light. </div>

<div>The self&#45;incompatibility &#40;SI&#41; response occurs widely in flowering plants as a means of preventing self&#45;fertilization. In these self&#47;non&#45;self discrimination systems, plant pistils reject self or genetically related pollen. In the most widespread SI system, pistil&#45;secreted S&#45;RNases enter the pollen cytoplasm and function as cytotoxins to specifically inhibit growth of the cognate pollen tube. However, the precise role of the S&#45;locus F&#45;box protein, the pollen determinant, is largely unknown. We provide evidence showing that SLF&#45;interacting SKP1&#45;like1 &#40;SSK1&#41; protein is a specific adaptor in an SCFSLF complex and that SSK1 is essential for pollen to overcome S&#45;RNase cytotoxicity. This pollen&#45;specific SSK1&#45;SLF interaction occurs in Petunia and Antirrhinum, two species from the Solanaceae and Scrophulariaceae, respectively, indicating that this novel SCFSLF complex is conserved in the two different families with the S&#45;RNase&#45;based SI system. Significant reduction of SSK1 expression level does not impair the pollen tube growth in SI&#45;defective styles, but results in pollen inhibition in cross&#45;pollinations of functional SI&#45;styles. This general incompatibility suggests that the pollen determinant contributes to inhibiting, rather than maintaining the S&#45;RNase activity, at least in solanaceous plants. </div>

<div>Stomata form pores on leaf surfaces that enable the plant to &#8216;breathe&#8217;. These pores function primarily to regulate the uptake of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and the loss of water during transpiration under constantly changing environmental conditions. Each stomatal pore is surrounded by a pair of guard cells and changes in the turgor of the guard cell pair results in the opening and closing of the stomatal pore. Sphingosine&#45;1&#45;phosphate, which results from the phosphorylation of sphingosine by sphingosine kinase &#40;SphK&#41;, has been implicated in guard cell signalling &#40;1,2&#41;. The sphingosine transfer protein, ACD11, has been shown to catalyse the transfer of sphingsine between membranes in vitro &#40;3&#41;. However, the role of ACD11 in stomatal guard cell function is unclear. We fused ACD11 to the red fluorescent protein &#40;DsRed2&#41; and showed, following biolisitc transformation, that ACD11&#45;DsRed2 is partitioned to discrete regions and punctuate structures within the cytoplasm of oinion epidermal cells. In contrast, SphK&#45;YFP is found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. Co&#45;localization studies following transformation with Golgi&#45;targeted GFP, ER&#45;targeted GFP and mitochondria&#45;targeted GFP suggests that ACD11 is not localized to the Golgi, ER or mitochondria. We have also analysed the expression of ACD11 and SphK and showed that both genes are highly expressed in guard cell protoplasts when compared to mesophyll protoplasts. This suggests that ACD11 may be functionally important in stomatal guard cell function.&#13;<br/>&#13;<br/>&#13;<br/>1.

<div>The Arabidopsis EIN3 protein is a key transcription factor mediating  <br/>ethylene&#45;regulated gene expression and morphological responses. We  <br/>have previously shown that the level of EIN3 protein rapidly increases  <br/>upon ethylene treatment. In the absence of ethylene, EIN3 is quickly  <br/>degraded through a ubiquitin&#47;proteasome pathway mediated by two F&#45;box  <br/>proteins, EBF1 and EBF2. In this study, we demonstrated that loss of  <br/>EIN3 function can only partially suppress various morphological  <br/>defects &#40;including the triple response, plant height, leaf epinasty,  <br/>seed fertility, floral development&#41; observed in the ebf1 ebf2 double  <br/>mutants. We further showed that ethylene positively regulates the  <br/>level of EIL1 protein, the closest homolog of EIN3 in Arabidopsis,  <br/>through a ubiquitin&#47;proteasome&#45;dependent pathway. Consistently, we  <br/>found that although loss of EIL1 function can only slightly suppress  <br/>ebf1 ebf2 double mutant, loss of both EIN3 and EIL1 functions are able  <br/>to completely rescue myriad defects caused by ebf1 ebf2 double  <br/>mutations. Genome&#45;wide gene profiling analysis revealed that EIN3 and  <br/>EIL1 are two critical transcription factors mediating most, if not  <br/>all, of ethylene&#45;regulated gene expression in either wild&#45;type or ebf1  <br/>ebf2 mutant backgrounds. Furthermore, our data revealed that ethylene  <br/>is not require to activate EIN3 and EIL1 when EILN3&#47;EIL1 protein is  <br/>constitutively present in the nucleus, suggesting that control of  <br/>protein level is the primary mechanism of ethylene regulation on  <br/>EIN3&#47;EIL1 activity. Taken together, these results indicate that, as  <br/>EIN3, EIL1 is a primary target for the EBF1&#47;EBF2&#45;mediated degradation  <br/>pathway, and that regulation of EIN3&#47;EIL1 protein abundance in the  <br/>nucleus is the key step in the response to ethylene gas.</div>
