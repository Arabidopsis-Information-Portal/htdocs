One of the main tasks of the genetics of photosynthesis is the
investigation of cell genetic factors contributing to the formation of
structure and function of the photosynthetic apparatus.<p>

In previous reports (Usmanov et al., 1975) we have established
positive correlations between the number of chromosomes and
chloroplats in a plant cell.  At the same time the size of
chloroplasts did not change. This enabled us to conclude that
chloroplast number is controlled by nuclear genes. We proposed, that
chloroplast size is regulated by plastogenes.  In connection with this
investigation the effect of chromosome number on chloroplast
ultrastructure and function was studied in three species of
Arabidopsis: Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh., 2= 10; Arabidopsis
wallichii, 2n=16; Arabidopsis korschinskyi Botsch, 2n=48.<p>

A qualitative electrone microscopic analysis showed, that the
chloroplasts of A. thaliana are similar to that of other green plants.
Their membrane system is fully developed with grana consisting of 3 to
15 thylakoids. Single small starch grains are observed (Figure 1A).
However, the chloroplasts of A. korschinskyi are paucigranal with
grana consisting of 2 to 4 thylakoids. An important feature of these
chloroplasts is the presence of large starch grains occupying a great
part of plastid volume.  (see Table 1 and Figure 1B).  According to
the ultrastructural organization of the membrane system the
chloroplasts of A. Wallichii are similar to that of A. thaliana and A.
korschinskyi. Difference between them can be observed only by means of
quantitative characteristics of plastic components (see Table 1).<p>

It is shown in Table 1, that the increase of chromosome number is
accompanied, on the one hand, by the thylakoid volume decrease, and on
the other hand, by the greater starch content of the chloroplasts. As
to the other components, significant changes depending on ploidy were
not observed.<p>

The data obtained are of great interest for the study of the genetic
control mechanisms of starch formation and of the transport of
assimilates in plants. Experimental data presented in this paper
evidence that alterations of chromosome number correlate with
alterations in the volume of the membrane system (thylakoids).
Therefore, we conclude that the factors controlling the formation of
starch and thylakoids are localized in the nucleus.<p>

In order to elucidate the mechanisms of genetic control of these
processes, probably, we must know the number of genes taking part, and
what biosynthetic processes are basically. To our regret, the genetics
of starch formation in chloroplasts is not partically investigated.
Biochemical foundations of starch formation are better studied.
Judging from the data obtained starch accumulation in chloroplasts
takes place either due to the decrease of the assimilate's
concentration gradient on the border "chloroplast - cytoplasm" that
weakens their diffusion through the membrane (Kursanov, 1976) or as a
result of the difference between the activity of synthesis and the
dissolving of starch enzymes, that causes a disbalance between the
accumulation and sinking of assimilates.<p>

From the fact that starch accumulates in connection with the increase
of the chromosome number one cannot decide between one of the possible
mechanisms of starch formation mentioned above. For this purpose a
number of special genetic, physiological and biochemical experiments
must be carried out, which are successfully developed at present (Cox,
Dickinson, 1971; Vettermann, 1973; Badenhuizen, 1959).<p>

Furthermore, it was interesting to investigate the influence of
thylakoid and starch volume changes, on the photosynthetic activity,
considering that the changes are caused by chromosome number.  In
Table 2 the results of different ways of the photosynthetic CO2
fixation are given per gram of weight, leaf area, and per chloroplast.<p>

Table 2: The efficiency of the photosynthetic apparatus in relation to
chromosome number.<p>

The analysis of these data shows that the increase of chromosome
number positively correlates with the photosynthetic efficiency per
both weight and leaf area unit.  However, photosynthetic efficiency
per chloroplast yields opposite results.  A detailed analysis of these
data will enable us to speculate over the differences obtained.<p>

On the basis of the well-known fact that thylakoid volume and
photosynthetic efficiency directly correlates, the results obtained
can easily be explained. From the Figure 1 and Table 1 it is seen that
the increase of chromosome number causes an increase of starch content
and a volume decrease of the photosynthetically active membranes in
the chloroplasts. Consequently, the decrease of photosynthetic
efficiency per one chloroplast in A. korschinskyi results from the
lower amount of thylakoids in comparison with A. thaliana.<p>

Leaf anatomy investigations reveals essential differences in mesophyll
structure of the species studied. For example, in A. korschinskyi a
thickened leaf contains three layers of palisade cells unlike A.
thaliana in which the mesophyll is represented only by one layer.
Thus, high photosynthetic efficiency per dry weight and leaf area in
A. korschinskyi is due to the larger amount of chloroplasts in a cell.<p>
