Research on the population genetics of Arabidopsis thaliana has
concerned variability of morphological and phenological characters.
However, these studies need to be complemented with surveys of
enzymatic variation. Electrophoretic analysis of enzymes have been
limited to investigations of geographical races (Grover, 1975; Jacobs,
1971) rather than samples of natural populations. Here we report on
polymorphism of A. thaliana populations from Poland as regards to 8
enzyme systems.<p>

The materials of this study were samples from each of 18 populations
(20 individuals per population) and line Wilna-2 as a control.
Electrophoretic assays were carried out in 12% starch gels on enzyme
extracts from rosette leaves of 4-week old plants. The plants were
grown from seed in a laboratory growth chamber. Electrophoresis was
performed according to Soltis et al. (1983). The gels were run with
buffer system 3 (MDH, GDH, IDH), system 6 (EST, AP) and system 7 (LAP,
GOT, CAT). After electrophoresis the gels were cut into three slices
of 2 mm thickness for staining. The following methods of staining were
used in this survey: LAP, IDH, MDH, - Soltis et al. (1983); Cat, Got,
AP - Cardy et al. (1980); GDH - Brown et al. (1978); EST - Shaw and
Prasad (1970).<p>

Considerable differences between the enzyme systems were detected for
levels of polymorphism. The most variable enzyme system was that of
esterase. There were 6 isoenzyme patterns which differed markedly in
frequency of occurring (Figure 1).<p>

populations.<p>

Two main zones of activity are distinguished. There are two
electrophoretic variants (both containing 5 bands) with different
mobility in the slower zone. The first variant was found in 3
populations which were at the same time polymorphic for this zone. The
faster zone was more differentiated, as 5 various patterns were
distinguished.<p>

As regards acid phosphatase (AP) two zones of banding activity were
found that confirms the results of Jacobs and Schwind (1973). The same
three types of electrophoretic variants were found in AP-1 group
(slow, intermediate, fast) as those presented in the paper mentioned
above. The frequency of these variants in our study was nearly the
same as for 84 geographical races investigated by Jacobs and Schwind.
With regard to AP-1 group, polymorphism was found in 8 populations and
two of three possible types of heterozygotes were detected as well.
Only, the hybrid between slow and fast variant was not observed and
frequency of both remaining types was the same (2%). AP-2 group was
invariable in our study.<p>

The relatively high level of polymorphism was observed for the LAP
system. Referring to the results of Grover (1975) there are two
migration zones controlled by the two different loci: LAP-1 (the
faster zone) and LAP-2 (the slower one). Two alleles were found by
Grover at each locus, and our study confirmed the existence of these
alleles. Additionally, at the frequency of 2% we observed a new, the
most anodal band in the zone LAP-2. Intrapopulation variability was
detected in 4 populations. However, the heterozygote pattern did not
occur.<p>

glutamate-oxalacetate transaminase (GOT), malate dehydrogenase (MDH0
and catalase (CAT) in A. thaliana populations.<p>

There are three enzymatic phenotypes on gels stained for IDH (Figure
2). Patterns denoted by number 1 and 3 occurred at the frequency of
54% and 43.7%, respectively, whereas the remaining one is considerably
less frequent (2.3%). Phenotype 2 contains three bands. It can be the
heterozygotes pattern, as this kind of phenotype is characteristic for
hybrids between parents with two different one-banded variants of
dimeric enzyme. Precise genetic analysis is being performed to test
this hypothesis. Polymorphism for IDH was observed in 6 populations,
and phenotype number 2 was detected in two of them.<p>

There was low level of variation for GDH. We found two electrophoretic
phenotypes (slow and normal) which were very similar to those
discovered by Cammaerts and Jacobs (1983) in 85 geographical races.
Among 18 populations under study only one was characterized by slow
variant. This particular population was polymorphic since normal
variant was detected at the frequency of 18%.<p>

The remaining enzyme systems (MDH, GOT, CAT) were invariable in our
study. Obtained phenotypes are presented in Figure 2.<p>
