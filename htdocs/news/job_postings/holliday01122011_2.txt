Graduate student research opportunity in evolutionary genomics

Department of Forest Resources and Environmental Conservation Virginia
Polytechnic Institute and State University

A graduate research assistantship for an NSF-funded project is available
in the Department of Forest Resources and Environmental Conservation at
Virginia Tech. The overarching goal of the project is to understand the
genomic basis for climatic adaptation in the model tree Populus
trichocarpa (poplar) and related species. The successful candidate will
participate in a genome-wide association mapping study, with downstream
analyses involving comparative and landscape genomics. The project will
involve assisting with the generation and analysis of genome-wide
sequence data, phenotyping of adaptive traits, mentoring of
undergraduate students in the lab, and participating in outreach
activities. A bachelor's or master's degree in molecular biology,
evolutionary biology, botany, or a related field is required.
Programming experience would be an asset (e.g., Perl, R). Full support
(tuition, stipend, health care) will be provided.

cutting edge of plant genomics research, please contact Jason Holliday
