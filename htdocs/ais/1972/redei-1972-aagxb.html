<h2> Fructose intolerance in Arabidopsis, Cardaminopsis and Hylandra</h2><p>

Sucrose, glucose and fructose all support the growth of the majority
of plant species in aseptic culture - under certain conditions though
there are significant differenes among these three sugars (HILDEBRANDT
& RIKER, 1949; STREET, 1959).  On 3% fructose under continuous
illumination and at light intensities between 300 and 500 foot candles
at temperature between 20-30*degrees*C the fresh weight of Arabidopsis
(4n), Cardaminopsis arenosa (4n) and Hylandra suecica is reduced to
20-30% of that of plants grown without sugar on otherwise identical
mineral agar medium.  The reduction of dry weight is not as drastic
though very significant.  Under identical culture conditions but under
only 8 hours daily light regimes, on fructose all three species
produced more dry weight than on sugar-free media though they
developed a conspicuous chlorophyll deficiency.<p>

A generally recessive human metabolic anomaly, hereditary fructose
intolerance, has been traced to fructose-1-phosphate aldolase enzyme
deficiency in the affected individuals (FROESCH, 1966; PRADER, 1969;
RIEU et al., 1971).<p>

Plant biochemistry texts (BONNER and VARNER, 1965; DOBY, 1965) do not
mention fructose-1-P adolase, though the existence of such an enzyme
in animal tissues has been long recognized (LEUTHARDT 7 WOLF, 1954).
Fructose-1, 6-diphosphate aldolase is common apparently in all plant
species.  Aldolases in higher animals display 5 or more isozymic forms
(LEBHERZ & RUTTER, 1969), in plants the number of isozymic species of
aldolase is very limited (LEBHERZ & RUTTER, 1969; KAZUSUKE, 1969).<p>

In Arabidopsis, Cardaminopsis and Hylandra only one main
fructose-1,6-ciphosphate aldolase is detectable by cellulose
polyacetate electrophoresis. This band moves slowly toward the
positive pole with a slight difference in these three species.  In
wheat both an anodic and a cathodic band could be detected under
identical conditions.<p>

Table 1: Aldolase assays on Arabidopsis, Cardaminopsis and Hylandra.
Combined values of three experiments. Enzyme was extracted from plants
aged 20, 31 and 33 days, respectively, grown under aseptic conditions
in mineral-agar with the indicated supplements.  Natural daylength in
October and November, approximately 68*degrees*C temperature in
greenhouse<p>

(CORRECTION from volume 10: Enzyme activity data have to be multiplied
by a factor of3.)<p>

Fructose, 1,6-diphosphate aldolase assays (according to the method of
PENHOET et al.) detected considerable activities in Arabidopsis,
Cardaminopsis, Hylandra and wheat.  Fructose-1-phosphate aldolase
activity was practically absent however in Arabidopsis, Cardaminopsis
and Hylandra and appeared extremely low in wheat.<p>

A comparison of the fructose-1,6-phosphate aldolase activity in the
three species was dependent on the conditions of culture (Table 1).<p>

Obviously fructose expressed or other ways modified this enzyme in a
specific manner since the activity of phosphohexose isomerase, an
enzyme used as a general control, showed no difference under these
conditions. Thus it appears that in fructose intolerance in these
three species aldolase plays an important role.<p>
