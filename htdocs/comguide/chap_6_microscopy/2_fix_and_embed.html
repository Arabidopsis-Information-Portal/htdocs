1.  SOLUTIONS
  (i) 12% PARAFORMALDEHYDE STOCK
 *  All manipulations should be performed in a fume hood.

 Heat 100 ml of distilled water to 80oC then add 12 g paraformaldehyde - 
stirring constantly.  Most should dissolve.  Remove from heat and add 
dilute (approx 2%) sodium hydroxide dropwise until all the 
paraformaldehyde has dissolved.  Cool on ice. Bring the pH back down 
to 7.0 using H2SO4 

  (ii) 0.2M PHOSPHATE BUFFER STOCK
   A: Dissolve 3.12 g of sodium dihydrogen phosphate in 100 ml distilled 
water.
  B: Dissolve 6.162 g of disodium hydrogen phosphate in 100 ml distilled 
water.
Mix 39 ml of A and 61 ml of B to obtain 0.2M stock solution pH 7.0.

  (iii) SUBBED SLIDES
 *  All manipulations should be performed in a fume hood.

Wash slides in detergent, rinse thoroughly and completly dry.  Dip slides 
for 10 sec in a 2% solution of aminopropyltriethoxysilane (TESPA) in 
acetone.  Rinse twice in 100% acetone then rinse in distilled water.  Air 
dry in a dust free environment.
 *  Slides may be stored for several months.

2.  FIXATION
  (i) Excise Arabidopsis inflorescences and immediately place into a 
freshly prepared solution containing 3% paraformaldehyde and 1.25% 
gluteraldehyde in 0.05M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0.  Fix o/n at r.t. with 
gentle agitation using a 45o rotating platform at 2rpm.
 *  There should be at least 10 vol fixative relative to the amount of tissue.  
Each infloresence  contains air, trapped inside the tissue and around the 
trichromes, causing it to float in the  solution.  An overnight fixation 
protocol was used to ensure complete penetration of fixative.   In our 
experience, vacuum infiltration (using shorter infiltration times) gives 
poorer  morphological preservation.  Post fixation in osmium should be 
avoided as this can prevent  polymerisation of L.R. White resin.

3.  DEHYDRATION
  (i) Dehydrate for 60 min in each of the following percentages of ethanol:
12, 25, 50, 75, 95, 100, 100%.   Dehydrate at r.t. with gentle agitation 
and change the solution every 30 min.
 *  Ethanol dried using molecular sieves should be avoided as tiny, hard 
particles from the  beads can enter the tissue preventing good tissue 
sectioning. 

4.  EMBEDDING IN L.R. WHITE
 *  When performing histochemical or immunological studies substrate 
retention and  antigenicity may be improved by shortening dehydration 
times and infiltrating in L.R. White  from 70% ethanol.

  (i) Infiltrate tissues o/n at r.t. in a 1:1 mixture of 100% ethanol:L.R. White
(medium grade) with gentle agitation. 
  (ii) Infiltrate tissues in 100% L.R. White for 36 h at r.t. with gentle 
agitation changing the solution twice daily.
 *  Always allow the L.R. White to equilibrate to r.t. before using to 
prevent the absorption of  atmospheric water.

  (iii) Embed inflorescences in polypropylene embedding capsules using 
fresh L.R. White and polymerise overnight in a 60oC oven.
 *  Use only polypropylene or gelatin embedding capsules and 
completely fill with resin as the  presence of air prevents polymerisation.  
Polymerising at lower temperatures (55-58oC) may  improve tissue 
permeability.  L.R. White may be polymerised at r.t. using chemical 
accelerators  though their use is not recommended for histochemical or 
immunological studies.

5.  EMBEDDING IN WAX
  (i) Infiltrate tissues o/n in a 1:1 mixture of 100% ethanol:Histoclear with 
gentle agitation.
  (ii) Infiltrate tissues in 100% Histoclear for 24 h with gentle agitation 
changing the solution twice daily.
 *  There are alternative reagents available such as 1,1,1, trichloroethane 
(Inhibisol), xylene and  chloroform.  However, Histoclear circumvents the 
safety hazards associated with others.

  (iii) Infiltrate tissues in a 1:1 mixture of Histoclear:wax at 56oC overnight.
  (iv) Infiltrate tissues in 100% wax at 56oC for 36 h changing the solution 
twice daily.
  (v) Embed in fresh wax.
 *  The high temperature and long incubation period necessary during 
the wax infiltration steps  causes loss of much enzyme activity.  In our 
experience, this protocol gave poor histochemical  results.  A variety of 
low melting point waxes are now available which may reduce this 
problem.   We found the sectioning quality of Paraplast plus to be 
superior, ribbons of 2 um sections are  possible if wax blocks are first 
cooled on ice.

6.  EMBEDDING IN PEG 1000
 *  PEG 1000, polyethylene glycol 1000, is a polymer of average 
molecular weight 950-1050.

  (i) Infiltrate tissues o/n in 1:1 mixture of dry ethanol:PEG 1000 at 42oC 
  (ii) Infiltrate tissues in PEG 1000 for 48 h at 42oC changing the solution 
twice daily.
  (iii) Embed in fresh PEG 1000 in suitably sized moulds.

 *  We found PEG 1000 unsuitable for gross morphological studies as 
various organs within the inflorescence became mobile when sections 
were floated onto water on the glass slides.  The solubility and low 
melting point of PEG 1000 also makes sectioning difficult.  
Polypropylene beakers should be avoided when using PEG 1000.

7.  NOTES
 *  Block orientation: use pencil if labels inside block.  Use syringe & filter.
Knives must be  sharp.  Care on temp of hot plate when drying down. Care on temp
of slide/section when  staining with tol blue.  Allow dpx to set hard before
viewing slides.
