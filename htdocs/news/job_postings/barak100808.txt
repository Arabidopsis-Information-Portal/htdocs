Post-Doctoral Position:
Applications are invited for a post-doctoral position to study the regulation of 
Arabidopsis responses to abiotic stresses. The successful candidate will join the team of 
Dr. Simon Barak at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Jacob Blaustein Insts. for 
Desert Research in partnership with a European biotechnology company.
        The post-doctoral fellow will perform a functional genomics-based screen for 
genes regulating the response of Arabidopsis to multiple abiotic stresses (Kant et al. 
(2008) Plant, Cell and Environ 31: 697-714; Kant et al. (2007) Plant Physiol. 145: 814-
830). A technician will be specifically assigned to the project to aid the post-doc to screen 
Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion mutants. Essential skills required are a strong background 
in molecular biology, with experience in bioinformatics an advantage but not essential; 
the ability to adapt and learn quickly; good communication and organizational skills; and 
the ability to work independently.
            The appointment will be for one year with possible annual extension to two or 
more years. For further details and/or to apply, please contact:
