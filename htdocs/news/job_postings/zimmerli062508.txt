Postdoctoral Position, Arabidopsis defense responses to bacteria, National Taiwan 
University, Taipei. 
 
A postdoctoral position is available in Laurent Zimmerli?s lab at the National Taiwan 
University in Taipei. We are interested in Arabidopsis stress perception. The research 
project will focus on the characterization of a lectin protein kinase KO mutant that 
demonstrates altered resistance to bacteria. The perfect candidate should have a good 
understanding of plant stress biology with emphasis on plant-microbe interactions. 
Candidates with strong skills in Arabidopsis molecular genetics are preferred. Proven 
ability to write scientific papers in English is desirable. Chinese language skills are not 
required and international scientists are encouraged to apply. 
 
The National Taiwan University is a renowned university in Asia and provides excellent 
conditions for research. This university is located in Taipei, a vibrant and amazing city.
