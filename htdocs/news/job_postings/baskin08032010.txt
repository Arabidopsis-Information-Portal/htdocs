I am looking for someone to join my lab to work on a DOE supported 
project on the relation between cell wall structure and morphogenesis. The 
project uses the emerging model grass, Brachypodium distachyon. Experimental 
approaches to be pursued include regeneration from protoplasts and various 
assays of cellulose synthesis. The position requires a Ph.D. in a relevant 
area of biology and preference will be given to candidates having experience 
with either cell wall biochemistry or plant tissue culture. The Baskin lab 
participates actively in the University of Massachusetts-Amherst 
Interdisciplinary Program in Plant Biology and also in a new cluster of 
scientists on campus working on B. distachyon. The University of 
Massachusetts is an Equal Opportunity Employer and I encourage all qualified 
persons to apply. To apply, please send your CV to baskin@bio.umass.edu. 
Check http://www.bio.umass.edu/biology/baskin/ for (somewhat outdated) 
information about my lab and feel free to contact me for more information.
