<h2>Inheritance of lethal chlorophyll mutants in tetraploid Arabidopsis thaliana</h2><p>

Arabidopsis thaliana is a suitable material for the laborious study of
tetrasomic inheritance because of its well known biological
characteristics and the following three features as well: (a) the easy
production of tetraploid strains which are highly fertile (BOUHARMONT,
1965), (b) an efficient induction of numerous mutations by the
l-methyl-3-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidine (MULLER and GICHNER, 1964) and (c)
the possibility of using lethal mutations via the embryo-test of
MULLER (1963).<p>

Autotetraploid plants, heterozygous for chlorophyll mutations, have
been obtained by two ways: (1) treatment of a tetraploid strain by MNG
(l-methyl-3-nitro-l-nitro-soguanidine) and (2) chromosome doubling of
a diploid offspring containing plants heterozygous for these
mutations.  The colchicine treatment was performed by placing a drop
of a 0.1 % solution on the apical meristem of seedlings.  For the
induction of mutations the seeds were presoaked in water (24 hrs) and
treated in a solution of MNG (0l08 g/l; 24 hrs.).<p>

(ad 1) In tetraploid individuals the MNG treatment produces triplex
heterozygotes.  The M2-generation (observed at the embryo stage in the
siliques of the M1-plants) contains duplex, triplex and quadruplex
genotypes in a proportion of 1 : 2 : 1 (if chromosome segregation
occurs). These three types of embryos are green and viable.  In the
M3-generation the duplex plants segregate into quadruplex, triplex,
duplex, simplex and nulliplex genotypes in a proportion of 1 : 8 : 18
: 8 : 1.  It is necessary to observe a large number of seeds, since
only the one nulliplex out of 36 individuals is homozygous recessive
and phenotypically mutant.  Moreover, only a maximum of 25% of the
M2-plants is of the duplex type and the actual number of heterozygous
M2-plants is always lower because of the chimeric nature of the
M1-plants after mutatagenic seed treatment.  The seeds collected on
dyplex M2-plants were sown.  But it was only in the siliques of
M3-plants (containing the M4 embryos) that an adequate proportion of
lethal mutants was recovered.  Especially the simplex M3-plants (8 out
of 36) theoretically give rise to 25% nulliplex lethal embryos.  In
some instances the number of white embryos corresponded to simplex or
duplex segregation ratios, but in other cases they were lying between
1/4/ and 1/36.<p>

(ad 2) It is easier to produce heterozygous tetraploids by inducing
the mutation at the diploid level.  This method also allows to compare
the transmission of a same mutation at both chromosome levels.  The
seedlings, treated with cholchicine, were derived from a heterozygous
diploid plant, segregating about 25% white embryos (the proportion,
calculated from more than 9,000 embryos on several plants for two
generations, was 24.3%.)  The green plants of the colchicined
population thus contained about 66% heterozygotes, yielding duplex
types after doubling of the chromosome number.  Tetraploid plants were
detected in the following generation by the number of the germination
pores and the size of the pollen grains.  Among these tetraploids, 3
plants were found with a rate of lethal embryos not significantly
differing from 1/4 (simplex), 8 with a rate approaching 1/36 (duplex)
and 11 without white seeds. The total percentages were 21.97 for the
simplex and 3.39 for the duplex plants.  These numbers did not deviate
significantly from the expected figures (25.00 and 2.78%).<p>

In the following generation the offspring of two of the supposed
simplex types was studied.  In the first instance, 9 plants
corresponded very well with a simplex segregation ratio (23.43% lethal
embryos) and 3 with a duplex type (2.83%).  The second offspring
contained about the expected number of duplex plants (10 out of 18)
with a normal proportion of lethals (3.10%), but the rest of 8 plants,
supposed to be simplex, gave a number of white embryos (19.03%)
significantly too low.<p>

Further studies are necessary to explain several unexpected ratios and
to compare the transmission of the mutations at several polyploidy
levels.  It will then be possible to estimate for some mutations the
relative frequencies of chromosome- and chromatid- segregagion.  Some
of the deviating segegation ratios may also be caused by a lower
viability of those embryos containing higher doses of the recessive
mutant alleles.<p>
