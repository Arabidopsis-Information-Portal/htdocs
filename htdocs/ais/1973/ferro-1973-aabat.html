Several investigations in the ch-mutants of REDEI and ROBBELEN have
shown fundamental results in the genetic control of the chlorophyll
biosynthesis. Further, the two mutated gene loci act on the total
amount of the carotenoids (KRANZ 1970).  Therefore, we are studying
the pleiotropic effect of two heteroallelic ch-genes on the primary
carotenoids (PC).<p>

Analysing the PC, *beta* carotene (beta-C) lutein (L), neoxantine (N)
and lutein-5,6-epoxide (LE) by the thin layer chromatographic method
(TC) of HAGER and MEYER-BERTENRATH (1966, 1967) plants of the wildtype
(ch+/ch+) and three mutant genotypes (ch1/ch1, ch2/ch2, ch3/ch3) were
used which had been cultivated from seed germination to flowering in a
glass house under standard conditions (KRANZ, 1968).  Further
difference spectra computed from in-vivo remission spectra of leaves
(DR) were analyzed by the method of KRANZ (1972, 1973).  The plants of
tthis material were cultivated in a growth chamber under controlled
light conditions (KRANZ, 1968).<p>

The PC studies probably do not participate in the metabolism of the
secondary carotenoids (SC). But N is a secondary product of *beta*-C,
L and LE descents from *alpha*carotene (*alpha*C) CYGAN, 1967;
GOODWIN, 1971).  The four genotypes reach the maxima of these PC at
different times. Table 1 shows that delayed development and pigment
reduction are in all cases positively corelated in the sequence
ch+/ch+ &gt; ch2/ch2 &gt;= to ch1/ch1 &gt; ch3/ch3.<p>

dry weight) in four genotypes of A.thaliana<p>

In order to detect exact differences between the genotypes the
analysis of the regrssions of the TC-values between the PC-derivatives
are carried out.  Figure 1 ascertains that about one third less
molecules N per mol *beta*C are admitted by the alleles ch1 and ch2 of
the first gene than by the allel ch3 of the second gene; in other
words the production of N from *beta*c is more reduced by the first
ch-locus mutations than by the second locus mutation. Further one step
in the PC-biosynthesis is controlled by the two genes before *alpha*C
is separated from (beta*C, because L, the descendant of *alpha*C, is
reduced in the mutant genotypes (see Table 1).  OGAWA et al. (1966)
and BOARDMAN and ANDERSON (1967) detected that L and N are
predominantly localized at the grana and *beta*C at the intergrana
membranes. Therefore the first ch-gene reduces the PC of the grana
stronger than the PC of the intergrana membranes; the second ch gene
reduces the PC of both membrane systems equally.<p>

Figure 2: DR-spectra of leaves in four genotypes of A.thaliana. (delta
E=ERi-ERj, ERi: In-vivo remission after dark period, ERj: Invivo
remission after 10 minutes light).<p>


In order to analyse the photoinduction and photodestruction of the PC
DR-spectra are measured between lambda = 465 to 530 nm after treatment
with light for 1, 10 and 60 minutes.  Figure 2 shows that there is one
PC-complex characterized by lambda max ~ 510 nm, which increases after 10
minutes light; i.e., this complex is photoinduced in the sequence
ch+/ch+ &lt; ch1/ch1 &lt; ch2/ch2 = ch3/ch3. 
But the other complex characterized by lambda max = 485 nm decays by light in
the sequence ch+/ch+ = ch1/ch1 &gt; ch3/ch3; in ch2/ch2 this complex is
absent or not photodestructed. Further experiments are necessary to
differentiate the components of these two complexes.<p>
