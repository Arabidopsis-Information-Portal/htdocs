A number of mutagenic agents have been used to induce mutations in
flowering time and plant weight in the early-flowering race Estland.
Over all the mutagenic treatments the M2 means shifted towards later
flowering and reduced log. fresh weight.  The M2 distributions were
skewed towards lateness and towards reduced plant weight, but when the
morphological mutants were removed from the data the distributions
became more symmetrical.<p>

The distribution and magnitude of the induced genetic variation and
the high heritability values indicate that selection should quickly
regain the loss due to the shift in the mean, and that real progress
would be predicted for both characters.  Selections have been made and
are currently being tested.<p>

Genetic correlation between the two characters was high in the total
date (-0.7), but when the morphological mutants were removed this
correlation was much reduced (-0.2).<p>

The mutagenic agents tested were thermal neutrons, gamma rays, ethyl
methanesulphonate (EMS), 2-chloro-ethylmethanesulphate, nitrous acid
and di-ethylsulphate.  The most efficient mutagens for inducing
quantiatively inherited mutations were the ionizing radiations and
EMS.<p>
