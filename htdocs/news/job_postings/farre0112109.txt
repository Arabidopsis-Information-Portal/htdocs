A POSTDOCTORAL POSITION is available in the laboratory of E. M. Farré at Michigan State 
University to work on the plant circadian clock and its role in growth and development. 
The Farre lab (http://farrelab.openwetware.org/) is focused on the study of circadian rhythms in 
plants. Two different projects are available. One project will focus on elucidating the molecular 
role of pseudo-response regulators in the Arabidopsis circadian clock.  For the second project the 
successful candidate will work in establishing metabolic processes regulated by the clock as well 
as characterizing the molecular mechanisms by which this is achieved. Applicants should hold a 
Ph.D. in biochemistry, plant biology or cell biology. Experience with bioinformatics tools for the 
analysis of large data sets and/or regulatory networks would be of advantage if the candidate is 
interested in working on the second project. The starting date is negotiable, though the earliest 
possible is preferred. The position will remain open until filled. Initial appointment is for 1 year, 
with funding for renewal up to 3 years. Michigan State University offers state-of-the-art genomics 
and metabolomics research facilities, with more than 150 plant biology faculty engaged in various 
aspects of plant genetics, biochemistry and physiology 
(http://www.plantbiology.msu.edu/;http://genomics.msu.edu/). 
Application Instructions: Interested applicants should send a brief statement of research 
accomplishments & research interests, a current CV, a copy of at least 1 recent paper and the 
names and contact information of three references. Please send information by email 
tofarre@msu.edu.
