A post-doctoral position is available at Stanford University to study cell
fate determination and cell-cell interactions during stomatal development
and patterning.  The project will focus on the characterization of a class
of transcriptional regulators that promote stomatal formation and their
relationship to MAP kinase-mediated signaling. Research approaches currently
being used include forward and reverse genetics in Arabidopsis,
microarray-based gene expression profiling, high-throughput protein tagging,
protein interaction methods and advanced microscopy techniques.  Additional
information about the projects in the lab can be found at
http://www.stanford.edu/group/bergmann/.  The successful candidate must have
a Ph.D., a strong record of accomplishment in molecular biology and the
ability to design and conduct experiments independently.  Prior experience
working with Arabidopsis is helpful, but not required.   Candidates must
have less than 3 years of postdoctoral experience.  The position is
available immediately and funds are secured for up to 3 years.  
 
Please email an application including a statement of research interests and
professional goals, a curriculum vitae, a list of publications, and contact
information for three references to: Prof. Dominique Bergmann (d
<mailto:bergmann@stanford.edu> bergmann@stanford.edu).
