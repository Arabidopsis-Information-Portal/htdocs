Mutant plants disturb in the reduction of nitrate by the enzyme
nitrate-reductase (NaR) can be isolated by selection for resistance to
chlorate. Steingrover and Feenstra (1981) reported the isolation of a
mutant resistant to a low concentration of chlorate (0.1 mM) when
grown on a medium with ammoniumsulphate as the sole nitrogen source.
The mutant grows well on perlite in a closed petri dish, but dies when
transplanted into soil. Plants grown in closed glass jars yielded some
seeds after crossing with wild type. Mutants were recovered in the M 2
with a frequency of about .25, showing that the mutant character is
monogenic and recessive. From a chlorate resistant F 2 seed a cell
line G1 was extracted, which was used for biochemical studies.<p>

In tissue culture of G1 the response to nitrate and chlorate was
comparable with that of plants. Callus died on ammoniumnitrate but
grew well on a mixture of amino acids as nitrogen source. In
combination with amino acid nitrate looses its toxic effect on callus
growth and even a positive effect of nitrate addition on callus growth
and on cytochrome-c-reductase-activity could be demonstrated. Callus
proved to be resistant to 80 mM chlorate.<p>

It was shown previously that chlorate resistance in Arabidopsis can be
brought about by a lowered uptake of chlorate and by a decrease in the
activity of the enzyme nitrate-reductase (Oostindier-Braaksma and
Feenstra, 1973). NaR of A. thaliana consists of subunits with
cytochrome-c-reductase (CcR) activity and a Mo-containing cofactor
that is shared by NaR and xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH). Measurements
of activity of NaR, CcR and XDH in mutants can give an indication
about the nature of the mutation (Braaksma and Feenstra, 1982). Under
indictive conditions no in vitro NaR-activity could be found in
extracts of G1. Fractionation by sucrose gradients (Braaksma and
Fenstra, 1982) of extracts of wild type-callus and G1-callus showed a
G1-CcR-activity which bands in the same fractions as wild type CcR and
wild type-NaR. Apparently in G1 CcR-associated subunits (4S) could be
coupled to an apoenzyme with approximately the same size as wild type
enzyme (8S). Therefore absence of NaR-activity in G1 cannot be
explained by disfunctioning of the 4S subunits or by failure in the
assembly of these 4S into a complete 8S apoenzyme. In extracts of G1
no XDH-activity could be detected, whereas wild type extracts showed a
clear XDH-activity. This absence of XDH-activity indicates, that in
mutant G1 the cofactor can function in asembling the enzyme complex,
but that electron-transfer by the cofactor has stopped.<p>

From the results, we conclude that G1 is a NaR-deficient, cofactor
mutant. Lack of any NaR-activity in G1 indicates that G1 is not a
regulatory mutant, which the previously isolated mutants (B25;
Braaksma and Feenstra, 1982) are supposed to be, but may be a
structural mutant affecting the synthesis of the cofactor. For the
properties tested G1 looks very much like the cnx-mutants isolated by
Moller and Grafe (1978) in cell cultures of Nicotiana tabacum.
Attempts are being made to isolate also mutants of A. thaliana
disturbed in the apoenzyme part of NaR using a combination of seed
mutagenesis and tissue culture. The problem of plant lethality is
avoided by selecting for chlorate-resistance in callus-forming M 2
seeds. By now nine chlorate-resistant cell lines have been isolated.
These lines are subject of present investigations.<p>
