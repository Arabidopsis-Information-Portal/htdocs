In the course of investigations designed to study the absorption and
translocation of radioactively-labelled mineral elements by plants, we
have set about the problem of adapting Arabidopsis for use as a
subject plant in experiments of the type done with intact bush bean
plants by Hawf and Schmid (1967). Because of the ease with which
Arabidopsis can be handled experimentally and because of its very
short life cycle, it should lend itself well to such investigations.<p>

To begin with, we investigated the possibility of growing Arabidopsis
in a medium essentially devoid of any organic materials at all. Our
initial work employed the recipe of Hoagland and Arnon (1950). Iron
was chelated with DTPA (FeChel-330; GEIGY); the medium was made
semisolid with agar added to a concentration of 0.75%. The plants grew
well in this medium; they were maintained in a small growth chamber
set for 23*degrees* C on a 16/8 D/N light cycle.<p>

A minimal medium was designed using the Hoagland salts. By culturing
plants in media which varied in one macro-nutrient element at a time
(all others held at the Hoagland level), we were able to design a
minimal medium in which the plants grew very well in the culture
conditions cited above. The recipe for this medium is provided in
Table 1. Also included are the corresponding concentrations of the
macro-nutrient elements as supplied in the medium recommended by Redei
(1965). The latter medium contains added sugar; ours contains none.<p>

With the development of a suitable growth medium, we turned our
attention to developing a method for rearing plants so that they could
be grown in a solution culture system to which radioactively-labelled
mineral nutrient elements could be added in order to measure both the
absorption of the essential elements and the internal redistribution
of these elements within the intact plant. Plants were started in a
mineral nutrient medium containing less agar so that they could be
removed from the substrate with their roots intact and, after suitable
rinsing of the roots, could be suspended with their roots in a liquid
nutrient solution. By using our minimal medium and adding reduced
amounts of agar, we found that a 0.4% agar medium allowed the seeds to
germinate and develop into small plants which then could be removed
with no apparent effect on the root system. These plants then were
supported by passing the roots through a hole in the center of a
plastic lid on a small container of minimal medium with no added agar.
In this way, the plants proceeded to develop normally in about 28
days, with the production of flowers and, subsequently, seeds which
were viable.<p>

Having developed a method for rearing the plants and putting them into
a solution culture system, we proceeded to add to the solution a
measured amount of 86 Rb as RbCl with the Rb concentration being the
same as that of K originally present in the medium. That plants can
and do absorb Rb as readily as they do K is a well-known fact. The
plants then could be harvested, with appropriate precautions, after
various periods of time in the nutrient solution and either counted
with a Geiger-Muller detector or dried in a flattened form and exposed
to X-ray film in order to develop radioautographs. With a sufficient
exposure time in the radioactive nutrient solution, one could detect
radioactivity even in developing ovules within the young siliques. In
point of fact, within three hours of exposure the plants already
contained detectable amounts of radioactivity (images on the X-ray
film) at the extreme tips of 20-30 cm-high plants.<p>

The ability to grow Arabidopsis in an essentially all-mineral medium
and then transfer the seedlings to solution culture for measurement of
mineral relations with radio-actively-labelled isotopes opens up
another application for the use of this plant in physiological
investigations.<p>
