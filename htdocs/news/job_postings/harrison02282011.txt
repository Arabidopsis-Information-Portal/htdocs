Post-doctoral position (plant and fungal genomics)

Description:
A post-doctoral position is available to join a team studying endosymbiotic associations of 
Brachypodium distachyon and fungi of the Glomeromycota. In this project RNA-seq is being used to 
profile gene expression during symbiosis with the aim of determining the molecular basis for 
differences in symbiotic function.  Brachypodium distachyon is a model grass of relevance to 
bioenergy grasses. The project focuses on both Brachypodium and AM fungi. The transcriptomes of 
several fungi will be assembled. Various Brachypodium genomics resources will be used to dissect 
functionality of AM symbioses. Recent publications from the lab include (BMC Plant Biology (2009) 
9(10): 1-19, Plant Journal (2010) 61:482-494, Plant Cell (2010) 22:1483-1497).  

Requirements:  Applicants must have a Ph.D., a strong publication record and demonstrated expertise 
in molecular biology and plant or fungal genetics or genomics.  Experience with RNA-Seq, plant-fungal 
interactions and/or strong computer skills are beneficial.  

To Apply:  Applicants should submit a CV, the names of three references and a letter summarizing 
research interests and relevant experience to Dr. Maria J. Harrison, (mjh78@cornell.edu.) Job # 
2011-05.

Project Location:  The Boyce Thompson Institute is a non-profit research institute affiliated Cornell 
University, Ithaca, New York, www.bti.cornell.edu. EOE M/F/D/V
