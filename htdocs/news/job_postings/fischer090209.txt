Applications are invited for the post of a PhD student in the Department of 
Forest Botany and Tree Physiology, University of Goettingen, Germany, to 
investigate the function of auxin transport in leaf abscission. 
 
 
 
 
Our group is interested in seasonal leaf abscission; a process which relies 
on highly coordinated cell separation. While down-stream events, as the 
activation and secretion of hydrolytic enzymes, are rather well studied; the 
hormonal signaling leading from the perception of decreasing photoperiod in 
the leaf blade to the induction of the separation process in the petiole is 
only poorly understood.  We recently established an experimental model system 
in poplar in order to study leaf abscission and could show that polar auxin 
transport is involved in the early signaling. 
 
The successful candidate will identify and localize auxin transporters in the 
abscission zone of poplar. She/he will be trained in immunolocalization, 
confocal microscopy and other relevant techniques. Mechanisms of hormonal 
cross-talk will be studied in Arabidopsis. Hands-on experience with basic 
techniques of molecular biology and a Master's or equal degree in Biology or 
Life Sciences are required. The position is funded for 36 months and the 
salary will be based on Bat IIa/E13 (50%). 
 
Informal enquiries should be directed to Urs Fischer, ufische@gwdg.de. 
 
Applications including CV, cover letter and names and addresses of two 
references should be submitted to Urs Fischer, Buesgen-Institute, Department 
of Forest Botany and Tree Physiology, Buesgenweg 2, 37077 Goettingen, Germany 
or preferably via email to ufische@gwdg.de. 
 
Closing date: 15th of October 2009. Funding is available immediately. 
 
The University of Goettingen is committed to equality of opportunity.
