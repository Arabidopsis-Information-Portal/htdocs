<h2> A four-leaf stage lethal mutant in Arabidopsis thaliana</h2><p>

Lethal-4 (1/4): Seedlings (1/4 1/4) grow normal and differentiation
continues up to the four-leaf stage.  Cessation of development start
with a degradation of chlorophyll at this stage. The four rosette
leaves turn yellowish and dry within 2-3 days.<p>

Origin: "Landsberg-erecta", line 5I, after 9 mM EMS.  Heterozygous
plants (L/4 L/4) normal, segregate 1/4 1/4-seedlings with a frequency
25% in M3 to M6, indicating complete recessivity of this mutation.<p>

The material is expected to be suitable for studies on developmental
processes in A. thaliana.<p>
