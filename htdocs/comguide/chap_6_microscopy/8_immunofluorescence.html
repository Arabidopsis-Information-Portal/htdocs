*  This protocol describes a simple procedure for the immunolocalisation 
of antigens within whole cells of Arabidopsis.

1.  SOLUTIONS
  (i) LIQUID MEDIUM
1x Gamborgs B5 medium
2% glucose
0.5gl-1 MES
adjust to pH 5.7 with KOH

  (ii) PEM
100mM PIPES, pH 6.9
5mM EGTA
5mM MgCl2

2.  PROCEDURE
  (i) Germinate for 3-7 days in liquid medium.
 *  Media containing glucose seem to keep mitotic index high over longer 
periods

  (ii) Fix for 1-2 h in PEM containing 8% p-formaldehyde and 5% DMSO.
 *  The fixation may need to be varied for different antigens.  This one is 
optimised for  microtubule stabilisation.

  (iii) Wash in PEM several times (if not processed immediately, wash 
once and leave o/n.  Wash twice next morning).
 *  This allows the roots to remain in a low concentration of fixative.

  (iv) Treat with 2% Driselase in PEM for 20-60 min.
  (v) Squash roots gently on to polylysine coated coverslips or flow slides 
to release cells from tissue.  Monitor cell release with binocular 
microscope.  Allow to air dry.  For surface features, e.g., cortical cells and 
root hairs, do not squash -- they stain well if the whole root is dried down 
on the slide.
  (vi) Rehydrate with PEM containing 0.03% Nonidet NP40 and rinse 
twice with PEM.
 *  This step can be variable depending on the age of the tissue -- if cells 
are not permeable to  the antibodies try increasing the amount of 
detergent.

  (vii) Add primary antibody at suitable concentration in PEM containing 
3% BSA.  Incubate in moist chamber.
 *  Slides must not be allowed to dry out from here till they are mounted) 
for 30-60 min at r.t.
 *  For visualising microtubules, YOL1/34 anti-tubulin from Sera labs 
works well at 1:100 dilution.

  (viii) Wash three times in PEM 
  (ix) Add the appropriate secondary antibody at suitable dilution in PEM 
as in step (vii).  Wash as in step (viii).
 *  If YOL1/34 was used as primary antibody, affinity purified FITC 
conjugated anti-rat antibody  from SIGMA works at 1:100 dilution). Wash 
as in step (viii).

  (x) To counterstain for DNA use the dye, DAPI, at 1ugml-1 in PEM and 
mount in Citifluor antifade mountant.  

*  This procedure is optimised for microtubules but, with minor 
modifications, probably any structural protein can be visualised.  Soluble 
proteins may be extracted at step (vi); a brief dip in cold (-20oC) 
methanol may be substituted for this step is the antigen of interest is
