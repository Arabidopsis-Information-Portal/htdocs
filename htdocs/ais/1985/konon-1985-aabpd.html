The thermal stability of cell functions depends on many factors, and
the level of mulecular mobility of protein formation to temperature
behaviour of genotypes is one of them. The level of conformation
mobility of protein macromolecules and ultramolecular structures has
great importance for optimum functions of organisms at temperatures
which prevail in the period of active life. It was essential to
ascertain which level of organization of cell structures reveals
differences in the thermal stability of plants.<p>

Therefore we have carried out a study of isolated chloroplasts which
resemble a kind of intermediate stage of organizational complexity
between the protein isolated from a cell and an intact cell. It is
known now that faint hearing leads to stimulation of Hill's reaction
in the consequence of uncoupling of electron transport and
photophosphorylation (Lutowa, 1982, 1983). Our task was to study the
influence of temperature on protein which is responsible for coupling
of electron transport and photophosphorylation. ATPase is localized on
the surface of thylakoid granas and intergrana thylakoids of
photosynthetic membranes (Sane, 1977)<p>

In order to solve this problem, we used chloroplasts of Arabidopsis
isolated from mutant genotypes differing in their structural
organization of photosynthetic membranes (Yakubowa et al., 1980).
Chloroplasts were isolated by Fry's method (Fry, 1970). Content of
chlorophyll in chloroplasts was determined agreeing with the data of
Arnon (1949). Enzyme activity was determined according to the quantity
of hydrolized phosphorus. For the determination of ATPase activity,
1.5 ml of reactionary medium was used containing (in M):
tris-HCl-buffer(pH 7.8)-9; ATP - 5; MgCl 2- 5. Tubes with reactionary
mixture were incubated in the darkness at temperatures of 18*degrees*,
25*degrees*, 37*degrees*, 60*degrees*, and 75*degrees*C. For our study
we used wild type race Enkheim of Arabidopsis thaliana L., its highly
productive mutant "Triplex" and the light green mutnat 58/15.<p>

As it is seen from Table 1, at temperature of 18*degrees*C (the
optimum temperature for photophosphorylation) ATPase activity of wild
type chloroplasts sharply declines by 40 min of incubation and remains
stable for 120 min. Raising of temperature of incubation to
37*degrees*C makes ATPase activity to increase twice as compared to
18*degrees*C. In this case the increase of the enzyme activity is
observed until 40 min of incubation, then its activity remains stable.
Raising of temperature to 60*degrees*C causes sharp increase of
activity during the first 20 min, and then it gradualy declines to the
end of incubation. In the process of incubation at 75 *degrees*C the
same regulation as at 60*degrees*C is observed. Raising of temperature
inceases ATPase activity during te first 20 min of incubation only.
The activity becomes the same by 60 min of incubation at 37*degrees*C,
60*degrees*C and 75*degrees*C, and by the end of incubation,ATPase
activity is lower at 60*degrees* and 75*degrees*C than at
37*degrees*C. The study of ATPase activity of the mutants "Triplex"
and 58/15 shows that it had the same character as in wild type at
these temperatures. It turned out that mutant 58/15 has the greater
rate of P n accumulation compared to chloroplasts of the wild type and
of the mutant "Triplex". Consequently, chloroplasts of the light green
mutant 58/15 are more thermally stable.<p>

It is known that raising of temperature lessens the viscosity of
lipids. It causes an increase of lability of biomembranes which is
displayed in their configurational changes and the decrease of
membrane permeability (Daniel, 1969). Levitt (1972) considers that
heating leads to changes of SH-groups to SH-groups in proteins. ATPase
is a SH-sensible enzyme (Petrack et al., 1961). Perhaps, the high
thermal stability of light green mutant 58/15 can be accounted for a
specific texture of the photosynthetic membranes of this mutant which
conditions a lesser degree of oxidation of the SH-group of this
enzyme.<p>
