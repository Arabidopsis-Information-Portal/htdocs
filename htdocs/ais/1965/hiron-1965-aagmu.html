Plants homozygous for ch (HIRONO 1964) when treated with ethyl
methanesulfonate (EMS) produced many yellow sectors of a phenotype
similar to that of tissues homo- or hemizygous for ch.  None of these
sectors were deficient in chlorophyll b and actually this was
expected.  X-irradiated wild types only very rarely displayed yellow
sectors of considerable size.<p>

Plants heterozygous for ch produced yellow sectors both when
irradiated or treated with EMS.  The sectors which appeared after the
irradiation were all similar inasmuch as the chlorophyll b content was
reduced.  Only one exception was found among 30 sectors examined.
About 1/3 of the sectors produced by EMS treatment has reduced
chlorophyll b content and in the majority of the sectors the total
pigment content appeared lower and this was the cause of the pale
green or yellowish color.<p>

The mechanism by which the yellow sectors arose could be studied if
shoots developed from the sector.  Sixteen stem sectors produced by
X-irradiation on plants heterozygous for ch were progeny tested.  In
four cases yellow sector was brought about by a premeiotic marker
exchange.  In two cases deletion of ch+ allele produced the yellow
sectors.  Because of the small size of the shoot sectors or because of
the low fertility (possibly due to the physiological effect of the
irradiation) ten plants failed to yield enough seed to clarify the
mechanism underlying the sector formation.  The information available
from the majority of this last group of sectors rules out the non-
disjunctional origin.  Deletion, mutation, or premeiotic exchange
between homologous chromatids may be responsible for these cases.<p>
