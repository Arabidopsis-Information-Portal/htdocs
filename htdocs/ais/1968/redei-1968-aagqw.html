<h2>Arabidopsis for the classroom</h2><p>

G.P. REDEI<p>

At the University of Missouri Arabidopsis has been successfully used
in courses on general genetics and experimental botany.  During the
past years numerous requests for seed to use Arabidopsis in classroom
demonstrations were received.  The outline of the following
experiments for general biology or genetics laboratory courses may
therefore be of some value to people interested in Arabidopsis as a
teaching aid.<p>

1.  Mendelian segregation and linkage<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol05/vol05-pg5-tab1.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

The F1 will be like the wild type, i.e., normal green and early.  F2
may be used for the demonstration of mendelian ratios and linkage in
coupling and repulsion phase.  Linkage intensity may be calculated in
F2 by the product method of FISHER and BALMUKAND (J.  Genet. 20, 79).
A few F1 plants should be kept under short-day conditions in order to
have available for F2 several thousands of seeds if obtaining ch pa
recombinanats is also desired.  Map distances: gi-25-pa-8-ch.<p>

Crosses may be made with the aid of 5x watchmaker's magnifier using a
pair of sharp forceps like Clay-Adams, Inc. (New York, N.YU.  10010)
No. C-911 or Peer No. 46-206.  Emasculation should be done before the
flowers open, but could be omitted in this case since the female
carries a recessive marker so that hybrids can be identified in F1.<p>

Suggestions for successful culture: Store seed in open containers
(like small vials) in a cool place.  Germination is unimpaired for
about 2 years.  Plant seeds singly on the surface of fine, sterilized
soil and never let them dry before germination.  Good cultures can be
secured in five inch diamater (ca. 12cm) short (Azalea) pots.  Water
by spraying with a fine nozzle, like the low volume "Water Fog",
before germination or until early seedling stage.  Later spray with
the high volume nozzle of Fogg-It Nozzle Col, P.O.  Box 1752, Oakland,
California 94604.  A better method is placing the pots in a suitable
aluminum or plastic lined tray containing distilled water.  Good seed
generally germinates within 3-4 days at 20-25*degrees*C, except in the
first days after harvesting.  Never transplant seedlings!  Never
provide more than 1200 foot candle light, if the plants are raised in
growth chamber.  Under 500 foot candle the growth is slow.  Natural
daylight and 100 foot candle incandescent continuous illumination
during the night is necessary for the F2 to be able to classify the
late types.  During the warm season protect plants from direct
sunlight that may cause sunburn.  Optimal temperature is around
25*degrees*C.  Plants should be protected from insects by parathion or
other suitable insecticides.<p>

2.  Biochemical mutants<p>

Plants of the ch1/ch1 genotype are yellow green and free of
chlorophyll b.  Use any other suitable yellow green plants, and also
pa/pa and wild plants, to demonstrate the difference between phenotype
and genotype.  The presence or absence of two chlorophylls can be
demonstrated by paper-or thin-layer chromatography.<p>

For paper chromatography cut paper strips (Whatman No. 1 or similar)
not wider than 6-8 mm and ca. 20 cm long.  Students will need two for
each plant to be tested.  Secure the same number of 150 x 16 mm or
larger test tubes equipped with a tightly fitting cork.  Add into each
test tube ca. 1 ml mixture of petrolether: acetone (10:1.2 v/v).  Also
each student needs one small test tube (8 x 75 mm) for each genotype
to be analyzed and half the number of glass rods rounded at both ends.
Also necessary are a few small, fine tip capillary tubes that can be
made in the lab with a Bunsen burner from suitable soft glass. A
dropping bottle equipped with a rubber bulb to keep abs.  acetone is
also needed.  Place one small or half leaf into the small test tube,
and macerate it with 3-5 drops of acetone and apply a well-visible
green spot about 2 cm from the end to each paper strip.  The quantity
of pigment on the two strips should be different.  Too small amounts
are not visible, while too large amounts may not separate
satisfactorily.  Place the strips into the larger test tube about 1/2
cm deep submerging the paper yet keeping the green out of the solvent.
Carefully fix the strip with the cork in that position.  Avoid any
contact of the filter paper with the side of the tube.  Perform all
operations, including the development in dim light. The separation is
accomplished within 10-15 minutes and can be watched.  At the solvent
front, observe the orange colored carotenes, next the xanthophylls,
then a bluish-green spot of chlorophyll a immediately below the yellow
green chlorophyll b is situated in all genotypes containing the ch+
allele, while ch1/ch1 plants do not show anything at this place.
Under a short-wave length ultraviolet lamp (mineralight UVS-12,
Ultraviolet Products, Inc., San Gabriel, California) chlorophyll b
displays a characteristic bright red color.  This can be seen only in
the absence of any other light source or in the darkroom.<p>

Thin-layer chromatography gives superb separation in a shorter time.
Apply a thin cellulose laywer (MN 300, Macherey-Nagel & Co., Germany,
or 2.5 x 10 cm glass plates.  Mix the powder according to instructions
of the label very quickly and dry the plates for 20 minutes at
90*degrees*C or over night at room temperature.  Apply extract and
develop chromatogram in any suitable small container (larger vial,
tightly sealed) with the mixture recommended above.  An evaluation is
possible within 5-10 minutes.  As an alternative, one may purchase
Polygram Cel 300 precoated plastic sheets 20 x 20 cm (a package of 25
is $22.00).  Cut these into 60 strips (1 x 6.6 cm) and develop the
chromatograms in 2 x 8 cm vials.  Appropriately drilled wood blocks
can hold the vials.  Development time is about 2-3 minutes.  A single
experiment coats less than 2 cents.  A dim light is not necessary as
the operation is rapid.<p>

3.  Nutritional mutants<p>

The genetic control of a biosynthetic pathway can be more easily
demonstrated with Arabidopsis than with any microorganism.  Thiamine
synthesis in vivo follows the three main steps:<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol05/vol05-pg6-fig1.gif">Click here for figure</a><p>

Mutant py is unable to make step No. 1; mutant tz is blocked at step
No. 2, and mutant th has an absolute requirement for thiamine (block
at step No. 3).  All three mutants are lethal unless thiamine or its
appropriate moiety is supplied.  On supplemented media all display
normal growth. The requirment of py can be satisfied by
2-methyl4-amino-aminomethyl pyrimidine HC1 (obtainable from
Nutritional Biochemicals, Cleveland, Ohio, 44128; $1.00/g).  Mutant tz
requires 4-methyl-5-beta-hydroxyethyl thiazole that is not a
commercial product but can be conveniently prepared by autoclaving an
appropriate solution of oxythiamine HC1 (available from the aboe
source: $4.80/g.  Any good commercial thiamine HC1 can be used for
mutant th.<p>

Aseptic culture: Each student prepares the following mineral solution
(mg/100ml distilled water): 
<pre>
NH4 NO3           40 mg
Mg SO4. 7 H2O     20 mg
Ca H4 (PO4). H2O  20 mg
K H2 PO4          20 mg
K2 H PO4          10 mg
Fe C6 H5 O7. 3 H2O   
(ferricitrate)     0.5 mg
</pre>
  Alternatively a large batch may be
prepared by the instructor, and 100 ml may be given to everyone in the
class.  Add to this enough good grade agar (ca. 1% so that seeds will
not submerge when applied to the surface.  Sucrose or glucose content
of the medium should be 2%.  Divide the autoclaved batch into four
equal portions (25 ml each).  Add to batch No. 1: 25 ml distilled
water, No. 2: 1 mg pyrimidine in 25 ml water, No. 3: 0.01 mg
oxythiamine in 25 ml water, No. 4: 1 mg thiamine in 25 ml water.  Mix
and distribute each medium into 9 test tubes of 5 ml each; plug with
cotton and autoclave at 15 lb pressure for 15 minutes. Sterilize
simultaneously ca. 250 ml distilled water for each experiment.  After
the agar is solidified, place approximately 50 seeds from each
genotype into separate small cloth bags. Treat the seed with a 5%
solution of calcium hypochlorite for 8 minutes.  The disinfectant
should be prepared at least one day ahead.  Rinse the material
carefully with at least five changes of cold sterile distilled water.
Use a small innoculation chamber for planting.  Precipitate
microoraganisms with a mist of 70% ethylalcohol.  Place three seeds of
each genotype on the surface of the agar in three tubes each of the
four media.  Within two weeks the culture is ready for evaluation. The
genotypes may carry code numbers so that the student can identify the
requirement and can construct the pathway on the basis of his own
observations.  To avoid mechanical contamination of the seed, mutant
on marked background py +; tx gl and th al can be used.  A large
quantity of seed of each mutant can be produced in pots by periodic
spraying with dilute thiamine solution.<p>

4.  Genetic and physiological control of photoperiodic response<p>

Segregation for late flowering can be seen from experiment 1.
Differences in photoperiodic response may be well-demonstrated by
planting in test tubes (as indicated in experiment 3) or on soil.
Observe the germination of the following genotypes under continuous
and 8 hour daily illumination, and record the order of the appearance
of flower buds whch is expected to be as follows:<p>

Illumination<p>

The very striking effect of 5-bromodeoxycytidine, a DNA nucleoside
analog, can also be demonstrated.  Prepare a mineral-sugar-agar medium
as suggested in experiment 3.  Make the following 5 variables, 10 to
20 test tubes each: (1) basal medium, (2) supplemented with
5-bromodeoxycytidine (10-5M), (3) supplemented with
5-bromodeoxycytidine (10-5M) plus deoxycytidine (the normal RNA
nucleoside, 10-3M).  The chemicals can be purchased in 100 mg
quantities for a total cost of less than twenty dollars from any
recognized supply house.  Place on seed of gi2 genotype on the surface
of the agar in each tube.  Expose the culture to high intensity
continuous illumination.  Record the time of germination and the
appearance of flower buds.  Treatments (2) and (5) should flower
within half the time of that required for the other treatments.  In
this system flowering is promoted by the suppression of DNA
metabolism.<p>
