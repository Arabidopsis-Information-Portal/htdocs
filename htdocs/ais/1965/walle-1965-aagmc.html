Vol 01S: <h2>Correlation Between the Mutation Frequency and the Alkylation of Deoxyribonucleic Acid upon Treatment of Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana with Ethyl Methanesulfonate</h2><p>

Solveig WALLES and G. AHNSTROM<p>

There is a growing interest in using alkylating agents for mutation
research and plant breeding. However, compared to ionizing radiation,
where the absorbed doses are largely independent of the morphological
characters of the plant material, the determination of dose in regard
to chemicals is a rather complex task. The uptake of chemicals in
plant material depends on several factors such as the character of the
chemical (ionic or molecular), the hydration rate of the seeds,
temperature etc. In general it is therefore not possible to calculate
the dose by multiplying the concentration of mlutagen with the
duration of treatment (cf. REVELL, 1953), but the dose has to be
evaluated from the actual concentration of the mutagenic agent within
the cells as a function of time.<p>

Measurements of the uptake of ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) into seeds
of Arabidopsis thaliana have been made by using tritium labelled EMS
(tritiated EMS has been synthesized by WACHTMEISTER et al.). The
results are presented in Figure 1, where the uptake of EMS is
presented as a function of duration of treatment for seeds presoaked
for 0.2 and 17 hours. When dry seeds were treated, the concentration
of EMS in the seeds increased<p>

Figure 1: The uptake of EMS by seeds of Arabidopsis after 0 (o), 2 (o)
and 17 (o) hours of presoaking. The concentraion of EMS is expressed
in percent of the equilibrium concentration of EMS in the seeds
increased parallel to the imbibition of water (Figure 1 and 2)
indicating that the hydration of seeds constitutes the rate limiting
process. (WACHTMEISTER et al.) On the other hand the uptake of EMS in
seeds presoaked for 17 hours occurs by diffusion (cf. BARLUND (1929),
COLLANDER and BARLUND, 1933).<p>

Figure 2: The inhibition rate at soaking of Arabidopsis seeds in water<p>

Figure 3 shows the rate of absorbtion and out-diffusion. The dose is
obtained from the integrated concentration - time curve. The
difference in dose between seeds presoaked for various periods of time
decreases as the time of treatment increases. Further; to obtain
reproducible values of the dose of mutagen it is necessary to wash the
seeds after withdrawing the chemical.<p>

Plant seeds presoaked for various periods of time exhibit a variation
in sensitivity to different types of mutagens. This has been shown by
ROBBELEN (1964) in Arabidopsis and NATARAJAN and SHIVASANKAR (1965) in
barley. ROBBELEN found that presoaking of the seeds for about 15 hours
increases the sensitivity to EMS with a factor of 15 compared to a
presoaking of a few hours. In order to determine whether the increase
in frequency of chlorophyll-mutations is followed by a corresponding
increase in alkylation of the DNA during the soaking, experiments have
been undertaken to estimate the dose of mutagen, degree of alkylation
and frequency of chlorophyll mutations during various stages of the
germination period.<p>

Figure 3: The uptake of EMS by dry seeds and seeds presoaked for 17
hours. The dose is equivalent to the area between the curves and the
abscissa. The shaded area represents the dose when dry seeds are first
treated for 3 hours with EMS and then washed for 3 hours with water<p>

Dry and preaosked seeds of Arabidopsis were treated with tritium
labelled EMS at 30*degrees*C. After the treatment the seeds were
washed for one hour. One fraction of the seeds was grown for
determination of the chlorophyll mutation frequency and the rest of
the seeds were used for isolation of alkylated DNA. The frequency of
chlorophyll mutations was determined by screening of immature seeds
from X1- plants (MULLER, 1963). All chlorophyll deficient seeds
independent of size were registered. The mutation frequency is
expressed as percentage of segregating plants in X1. DNA was isolated
by the method described by KAY et al. (1952) by using salt solutions
of different ionic strengths at low temperature to eliminate loss of
alkylated bases.<p>

Table 1 demonstrates the frequency of chlorophyll mutations and degree
of alkylation in seeds treated with EMS. Compared to the effect
observed by treatment with EMS after 0-3 hours of presoaking, the
"sensitivity" to the mutagen (measured as fequency of chlorophyll
mutations) is doubled when the seeds are presoaked for about 15 hours.
However, this increase is directly correlated to the degree of
alkylation as well as to the dose of the mutagen. Evidently, the
variations in sensitivity during the germination observed in our
experiments could be explained entirely by the variation in dose of
mutagen obtained by treating seeds, presoaked for various periods of
time.<p>

Discussion:<p>

BONOTTO: What evidence do you have about the alkylation of DNA?<p>

WALLES: A solution of purified sodium deoxyribonucleate was
fractionated by gel filtration with Sephadex G-25 and about 10
fractions were collected. For each fraction the UV-absorption and the
radioactivity was measured (Figure 4). A maximum of extinction at 260
nm corresponds to a maximum in readioactivity and the curves are well
fitted to each other. This proves that it is DNA, which is labelled.<p>

BONOTTO: Did you test the molecular weight?<p>

WALLES: No.<p>

ROBBELEN: The fact mentioned by KONZAK and that group at Pullman was
that EMS penetrates slower than the water at the time of soaking, and
that was an explanation for the delayed or maximal effect of EMS after
different presoaking time in reducing the growth and in increasing the
mutation frequency. But you found, that water and EMS goes together.
For after 32 hours already you have a maximum of EMS and water
imbibition. Then the question arose: What should be the reason for
this maximum action? I first wonder whether the DNA might be incured,
but I measured with autoradiography that DNA synthesis in Arabidopsis
seeds starts not earlier than 30 hours after presoaking, so that DNA
shouldn't be much different from 3 hours after presoaking to 12 hours
after that.<p>

WALLES: Yes, the uptake of EMS follows the water inbibition upon
treatment of dry seeds. But a maximum amount of EMS inside the cells
is not reached until 10 hours. However, if the seeds are soaked for 17
hours a maximum is reached aready after 4 hours. Whether the hydration
of the cells can also influence the reaction rate between EMS and DNA,
I don't know.<p>

FEENSTRA: I would like to know whether it is possible from the data on
DNA which you can extract from seeds, to estimate the amount of DNA in
the genome?<p>

WALLES: No, it is not possible.<p>

BONOTTO: I have an answer to the question of Dr. FEENSTRA: The DNA
content per diploid nucleus in Arabidopsis as estimated by SPARROW and
EVANS (Brookhaven Symp. Biol. 14, 97, 1961) was of about 1 *micro*g. -
Did you measure the amount of DNA and RNA per seed?<p>

WALLES: No, I haven't.<p>

MULLER: In relation to the question of Dr. ROBBELEN I have the
following one: What temperature did you use in your experiments, while
presoaking?<p>

WALLES: It was 20 *degrees* C.<p>

BONOTTO: Did you fractionate the cell extract or the purified DNA, and
with which method did you purify DNA then?<p>

WALLES: I isolated the sodium deoxyribonucleate and purified as far as
possible according to the method described by KAY et al.  (1952).
However, Na-DNA was precipitated with 1 volume of 2-ethoxyethanol
instead of 2 volumes of ehtanol. This removes RNA.  Polysaccharides
were shown to interfere very strongly. KIRBY (1956/57) managed to
separate nucleic acid from polysaccharides by extraction with
2-methoxyethanol from potassium phosphate solutions. All nucleic acid
was in the organic layer, but the polysaccharides were partially
insoluble and partially soluble in the aqueous layer.<p>

the crude DNA with 2-methoxyethanol. A sample of 0.5 ml of volume was
applied to a water washed Sephadex column, which was eluted with
water.  Fractions of 2 md were collected every 6th minute<p>
