/Plant growth and development/:  Research and teaching assistantships are still available.   
The major goal of the research is to use molecular genetics, physiology and 
bioinformatics to identify/characterize the molecular components that link gravity 
stimulus perception and the differential growth response. The successful candidate must 
be accepted to either the interdisciplinary Molecular and Cell Biology Graduate Program 
<http://www.biosci.ohiou.edu/mcb/> or the Environmental and Plant Biology Graduate 
Program <http://www.plantbio.ohiou.edu/epb/grad/graduate.htm> at Ohio University.
