<HR>
<H2>Column Descriptions:</H2> <P>
<BR>
<STRONG>Locus:	</STRONG><BR>
Name of gene identified by mutation, arranged in alphabetical 
order, and written in CAPS and without italics to avoid 
confusion between numbers and letters.  Genes marked with 
an asterisk are known by more than one name.  Synonyms for 
these genes are included in the table but are marked with 
(=) in the second (#) column.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>#:</STRONG><BR>
Chromosome where gene is located.  When two different numbers 
are included, the mutant gene exhibits linkage to markers on 
different chromosomes.  An equal sign (=) denotes synonyms as 
explained above.  <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Status:</STRONG><BR>
This column summarizes the current status of linkage data:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	CM:	Gene placed on classical map.<BR>
	AV:	Location approximated with visible markers.<BR>
	AM:	Location approximated with molecular markers.<BR>
	AVM:	Location approximated with visible and molecular markers.<BR>
	LO:	Gene assigned to linkage group only.<BR>
	U:	Nature and extent of mapping data unresolved.<BR>
	**:	Recent addition; analysis pending.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<STRONG>Cloned:</STRONG><BR>
A plus sign indicates that the locus has been cloned or the protein
product identified.<P>
<STRONG>Map:</STRONG><BR>
Estimated location (cM) of locus on classical genetic map.  
Numbers marked with an asterisk refer to 
genes that were initially placed on the recombinant inbred 
map based on data with molecular markers.  To compensate for 
map expansion of RI chromosomes, the estimated location of 
a given locus on the RI map was multiplied by the following 
constant: <BR>
<PRE>
<STRONG>(length of classical chromosome) / (length of RI chromosome) </STRONG><BR>
</PRE>
in order to estimate the corresponding location on the 
classical map.  These values for each chromosome were: 
<UL>
<LI>chromosome 1 (0.927); 
<LI>chromosome 2 (0.765); 
<LI>chromosome 3 (0.983); 
<LI>chromosome 4 (0.654); 
<LI>chromosome 5 (0.699).  
</UL>
Other genes were localized only to chromosomal regions: top; middle (mid); and bottom (bot).<P>
<STRONG>Linked Marker:</STRONG><BR>
Linked visible or molecular marker with recombination 
data available.  In some cases, data with more than 
one marker are included.  <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>% Rec </STRONG><BR>
Recombination percentage between locus and linked marker.  
A = locus is above linked marker; B = locus is below linked marker.  <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Lab:</STRONG><BR>
Reference laboratory that either provided linkage data or 
has worked extensively with the mutant.  Names and e-mail 
addresses for these reference laboratories are in <A HREF="plain_lab_list.asp">a separate listing.</A>
<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Full Descriptive Name of Gene Symbol:</STRONG><BR>
Self explanatory.  Contact stock centers, databases, 
recent publications, or reference laboratories for 
additional information.
