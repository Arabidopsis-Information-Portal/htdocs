TWO POST-DOC POSITIONS IN SYSTEMS BIOLOGY Edinburgh, UK 
 
 LEAD EXPERIMENTAL RA, 
 COMPUTATIONAL SYSTEMS BIOLOGIST 
 
 for the ROBuST project in Arabidopsis: 
(Regulation Of Biological Signalling by Temperature) 
 
The model plant Arabidopsis grows over a 15 to 20°C temperature range 
 how is dynamic regulation maintained  The £6M ROBuST project will 
measure and model the temperature effects on a 50-gene network, 
comprising the circadian clock, phytochrome signalling system and a 
cold response pathway. We will extend current ODE models, measure 
changes in molecular components and parameter values with temperature, 
and identify network structures that buffer (or enhance) temperature 
effects. The ten ROBuST labs include biologists working on molecular 
signalling and climate change, mathematicians, statisticians and 
informaticians at CSBE (Edinburgh), WSBC (Warwick), and the 
Universities of York and Liverpool. 
 
We are seeking: 
 
1. Experienced molecular biology/biochemistry PDRA for a leading role 
in Edinburgh: measuring kinetic parameter values, informing and 
evaluating mathematical models: 
Protein production and biochemistry/biophysics, preferably including 
Biacore SPR 
Molecular biology experience, preferably including plants e.g. 
Arabidopsis thaliana 
Experience of interdisciplinary work, high-quality publications 
Highly organised, with strengths in team supervision 
 
2. Computational Systems Biologist to adapt CSBEs informatics infrastructure: 
Strong background in computational systems biology 
Experience of database development in a biological context; also Java 
programming 
Track record of software delivery in a cross-disciplinary team setting
