SUMMARY<p>

CO 2 levels of up to 140,000 ppm were detected in the atmosphere of
small closed in vitro cultures of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh..
Plants were started as seed and grown axenically under continuous
light for 8 weeks. Bolting, flowering and seed pod production were
inhibited. If bolting occurred, plants produced more stems than
controls. Dry weight of vegetative growth was not significantly
differnt from control. The role of CO 2 or other possible factors in
suppressing reproduction needs to be investigated.<p>

INTRODUCTION<p>

While developing new cultural methods for space experiments, an
inhibition of reproduction was found in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.)
Heynh. grown in small in vitro cultures that were tightly sealed to
minimize moisture and gas losses. Inhibition appeared to be a function
of some environmental parameter in that occasional plants in sealed
tubes did produce some seeds. In all such cases close examination
revealed the possible loss of seal integrity. To test for leak effects
on growth, seals on cultures containing older plants without seeds
were deliberately pierced. Normal pods were seen about a week later
(Hoshizaki, 1982). This result and other similar tests indicated the
possibility of a gaseous factor affecting the production of seed pods.
From among the possible genes we selected carbon dioxide for our
initial tests because of its importance in plant metabolism in
addition to being amenable to quantitative analysis.<p>

METHODS<p>

Culture tubes, 25 x 200 mm, were modified with short side arms seals
with rubber septums to accommodate gas sampling. Fifteen ml of agar
medium having essential mineral nutrients supplemented with 2 percent
sucrose and 0.002 percent glutamic acid was contained in each culture
tube. Seeds of Arabidopsis were surface sterilized for 2 min with a
5.25 percent sodium hypochlorite solution diluted 20x with sterile
distilled water followed by a triple rinse with sterile distilled
water. Seeds were then aseptically transferred on each to 8 tubes
containing agar medium (Brown et al., 1976; Mirsche and Brown, 1965)
and grown for 8 weeks. A parallel set of 8 tubes without seeds served
as blank controls. One-half of each set was sealed with vinylidene
polymer film (Saran) held firmly in place by rubber bands (closed
culture) and the other half plugged with polyurethane foam which
allowed air exchange (open culture). In all, four treatments were
used, a closed culture with seed, a closed culture without seed, an
open culture with seed and an open culture without seed. Environmental
conditions in the growth room were 23+1*degree*C, 50-55 percent
relative humidity and continuous light of 3.8x 10 4 erg chE-2 secE-1
at plant height from power groove fluorescent lamps.<p>

Gas samples of 40 micro l were taken weekly except for the 5th and 7th
week from two replicates of each treatment. The remaining two
replicates were sampled only at the beginning and the end of the
experiment. The samples were analyzed for CO 2 by a Hewlett Packard
5880 gas chromatograph analyzer having a thermoconductivity detector
and a 1.83m x 3.2 mm diameter stainless steel column packed with
Poropak Q. Standards of 104, 2,100 and 150,000 ppm CO 2 in dry
nitrogen gas having an accuracy of +/-2 percent were used. Gas samples
were scored following standard presumptive procedures. Thus at least
two and possibly more samples were drawn for each data point.<p>

RESULTS<p>

Initial CO 2 concentration measured in closed cultures was 1054+/-116
ppm. The initial high CO 2 level could possibly be attributed to seed
germination since a full day had lapsed from time of planting to gas
sampling but this contention is not supported by the fact that blank
control cultures having only nutrient agar media also had comparable
high CO 2 levels. The high initial CO 2 level is more than likely
attributable to a procedural artifact where CO 2 generated by the
bunsen flame used for sterilization was retained in the sealed culture
tubes. Subsequent tests using the same sterilization sealing
procedures have verified the said procedures as a possible source of
CO 2 contamination.<p>

Only the result of seeded cultures will be discussed. At first week
end, CO 2 levels in the closed cultures had dropped below the open
control cultures as would be expected with photosynthesizing seedlings
consuming CO 2. Unexpectedly, in the following two weeks, CO 2 in the
closed cultures increased to an extraordinary high level of around
6,000 ppm (Figure 1).<p>

During this period when CO 2 was in the 6,000 ppm range, plants in the
closed cultures remained as rosettes and continued to produce more
leaves instead of bolting (see Figure 2B). In weekly sampled closed
cultures initiation of bolting and flowering were delayed until the
5th week as compared to open controls which bolted by the 3rd week.
Seed pods produced by the closed culture plants were less than 3 mm in
length and either aborted or failed to develop. These abnormal pods
are easily distinguished from normal pods of open culture plants which
were longer than 5 mm and produced viable seeds. Only a total of 6
normal pods were recorded in all replicates of the closed culture
treatment (see Figure 2A).<p>

The development of these few normal pods in the weekly sampled closed
cultures coincided with a drop of CO 2 to 500 ppm levels in the final
two weeks of the experiment. This drop in CO 2 level to ambient level
is surmised to be due to leaks induced by the multiple perforation of
the rubber septum or the introduction of ambient atmosphere or both as
samples were taken over the course of the experiment. Two culture
tubes were purposely set aside to test for the possibility of leaks in
frequently sampled cultures. These tubes sampled only at the beginning
of the experiment and at the end had a final CO 2 level of around
140,000 ppm and the plants growing in these tubes had only a slight
indication that the reproductive phase was initiated.<p>

A. Plant height in mm and total number of fertile seed pods ( )
counted on plants of each treatment. Depth of agar medium in the
culture tubes was around 50 mm thus leaving 150 mm for stem growth.<p>

B. Number of leaves per plant. Leaves with length shorter than 2 mm
were excluded from the count. Each value represents the mean derived
from 4 cultures.<p>

***Difference between closed and open cultures at P&lt;0.001.<p>

In terms of dry weight, no significant differences were found when
roots or shoots were compared between closed and open cultures.
However, for total dry weights which include seeds and pods, the
closed culture weight was significantly less (Table 1).<p>

Table 1: Harvest data of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. planted as
seed and grown for 8 weeks in open and closed cultures. Shoot weight
includes the hypocotyl, stems, leaves, and where applicable, the seeds
and pods. Root tissue was recovered by dissolving the agar media in
excess water with heat and gently removing the roots from the agar
solution. The amount of root tissue lost by this process was not
accounted for. Values are presented as average weight in mg +/-
standard error except for number of stems being average number +/-
standard error. *P< 0.05 and **P<0.25 between closed and open culture
treatment.<p>

Thus the process of growth or fixation of matter in both treatments
appeared to be the same up to the time of reproduction. Closed culture
plants apparently did not proceed or were inhibited in the final steps
of reproduction. In a study having a possible relevance to our
results, soybean plants were grown under controlled atmosphere shaving
2,100 ppm C0 2 and 5 percent O 2 (Quebedeaux and Hardy, 1976). Under
these conditions, soybeans failed to set seeds and this failure was
attributed to the low O 2 level given to the soybeans plants.
Furthermore photorespiration was inhibited and consequently a majorty
of the fixed carbon was retained. Thus the low O 2 soybean had at
least 10 x the dry weight as controls grown at normal O 2 levels. The
fact that the dry weight of our closed culture were not significantly
greater than open controls may preclude the role of low O 2 levels as
the inhibitor of seed production as demonstrated for soybeans.
Furthermore, if a one to one stoichiometric relationship between CO 2
and O 2 for respiration and phootosynthesis is assumed, then those
closed cultures having a maximum of 6000 of Co 2 would have an O 2
concentration slightly below the normal 20 percent level as a result
of respiration. This is still far and above the 5 percent level used
for soybeans and would add credence to the assumption that
Arabidopsis's response is different from that of soybeans.<p>

CONCLUSION<p>

Whether the inhibition of reproductive growth is due directly or
indirectly to CO 2 level was not determined at this time. Other
factors such as pH levels, ethylene accumulation, high humidity and
even oxygen depletion could be the critical factor and should be
examined. The source and the pathway(s) of carbon accumulated in the
plants and that found in the atmosphere are unresolved at this time. A
possible source of CO 2 increase that was ruled out, was the bacterial
fermentation of the sugar supplemented media. Additional studies will
be necessary to identify the source of the CO 2 increase in closed
cultures including the possibility that Arabidopsis is functioning as
a heterotroph under these conditions (Brown et al., 1979). Sealing of
small volume cultures or growth chambers to isolate plants from the
surrounding environment may have a marked effect on reproductive
growth and may be a limiting factor in small growth chambers.<p>
