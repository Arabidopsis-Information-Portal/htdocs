<hr>

With the growing number of EST sequences available through the NCBI's
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov" target="_top">GenBank</a>, it is becoming
easier to go prospecting for related genes in other model organisms.
The AREST web site was inspired by a presentation at Massachusetts
General Hospital by the guest lecturer Dr. Andrea Ballabio on the
extensive <a
href="http://www.tigem.it/LOCAL/drosophila/dros.html" target="_top">Drosophila
Related EST (DREST)</a> resource.  The AREST site like the DREST site,
shows blast sequence matches to translated EST sequences.  The DREST
site shows matches of Drosophila genes against human ESTs, while AREST
shows <i>Arabidopsis</i> genes matched against four animal species; human,
mouse (<i>Mus musculus</i>), fly (<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>) and nematode
(<i>Caenorhabditus elegans</i>).
<p>
Rather than selecting genes with known mutant phenotypes, as in the
DREST database, AREST sequences were selected from the all the
<i>Arabidopsis</i> sequences in GenBank having both a defined coding
sequence (CDS) and a Medline accession.  This reduced the
approximately 31,000 <i>Arabidopsis</i> sequences in GenBank down to 806.
These 806 sequences were matched against the ESTs in GenBank using
network tblastn, and the results for the four species above were
reformated into HTML for the web display.
<p>
The advantage of the AREST web display over the standard blast output
is that in the case where several sequences match a particular region
of a sequence of interest, all the matches are lined up as a group.
One can see clearly the more conserved and variable domains, as shown
in the figure below. <p>

= blue-green font, Nonconservative match = red font)
 
<p>
<b>Limitations</b>
<p>
1.  The AREST displays are meant only to stimulate your interest.  They are
built from the tblastn reports and so they are unlikely to contain the
entire sequence of the match.  If you find a set of sequence
alignments of interest, download the sequences from GenBank and try
the alignment independently before you cut and paste it from the AREST
display into your next publication or proposal.
<p>
2.  Maybe your sequence of interest wasn't included in the set of 806.
If this is the case, you can create a somewhat similar display using
"power blast" software from NCBI which has a HTML output option.  With
the help of a web browser, you can view the stacked alignment of
matching sequences as shown in the figure below for a blastn
alignment.  <a href="ftp://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/sim2/PowerBlast/">
Software is available</a> for Windows, Mac and some UNIX operating
systems.

<b>Future Direction</b>
<p>
AREST began life as a fun afternoon exercise following a noon seminar
by Dr Ballabio, and has grown since then.  The hope is that AREST
pages will expand to look at human (and mouse?) CDSs matched against
<i>Arabidopsis</i> ESTs.  Those blast reports may better define some
<i>Arabidopsis</i> genes.  However, there are hardware and software
difficulties to overcome before that happens. So, please
visit the site <a href="http://weeds.mgh.harvard.edu/arest/" target="_top">http://weeds.mgh.harvard.edu/arest/</a> periodically to check on progress.
