10th International Conference on Arabidopsis Research
Melbourne, Australia, 4-8 July 1999

Australian Arabidopsis workers warmly invite the International Arabidopsis 
community to hold their 10th Conference in Melbourne from 4-8 July 1999.  The 
Multinational Science Steering Committee has accepted our invitiation on your behalf.  
The conference is planned to continue the tradition of a University-based, low cost 
venue, at the University of Melbourne.  This is important as the costs of travelling to 
Australia are relatively high.  The conference is scheduled for the traditional period, 
i.e. summer in the northern hemisphere when many are free from teaching 
commitments.  This is winter in Australia, but Melbourne's winters are mild (no 
snow and only an occasional frost).  Melbourne is a large (3 million) cosmopolitan city, 
and local wildlife, including penguins and koalas, are accessible nearby.  The timing will 
also mean there are opportunities to visit Australia's tropical regions (Great Barrier 
Reef, Kakadu) en route during their optimal cooler season.

To give the meeting a wider regional focus, an International Advisory Committee has been 
set up involving colleagues from the western Pacific region.  Members are Kiyotaka 
Okada(Japan), Hong Gil Nam (South Korea), Venkatesan Sundaresan (Singapore) and 
Jo Putterill (New Zealand).

Further meeting information and registration details will be posted on the Arabidopsis 
thaliana Database (TAIR) web site early in 1999.

We look forward to hosting the 10th Conference, and welcoming you all Down Under for a 
friendly and interactive meeting.

Cheers
