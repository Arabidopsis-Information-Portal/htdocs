Extranuclear inheritance received increased attention in recent years.
This area of genetics is well suited for study with higher plants
because of their complex cells.  Arabidopsis may become of special
intrest because the complexity of the cellular structure is
accompanied with the smallest amount of cellular DNA among higher
plants (SPARROW, PRICE and UNDERBRINK, 1972).  Several other higher
plants contain 50-90 times as much DNA as Arabidopsis. The DNA content
of the chloroplasts varies relatively little among the various green
plants from algae to angiosperms, and it is in the range of that of T4
bactriophage (BASTIA, CHIANG, SWIFT and SIERSMA, 1971).<p>

Chloroplast mutability in Arabidopsis, like in several other plants,
apparently may be autonomous (ROBBELEN, 1962) or it may be contolled
by nuclear genes (ROBBELEN, 1966; REDEI, 1973).  Though autonomous
mutability may be the result of a number of different events, for the
sake of simplicity it is generally assumed that it is due to an
alteration in the template of the organelle. Template alteration in
the organelle must be involved also in the nuclear gene induced
mutability because the mutations can be fixed, maintained, and
transmitted in the absence of the inducer (ROBBELEN, 1966; REDEI,
1973).  The mutator gene may induce single or relatively few types of
alterations in its presence (REDEI, 1973).  If only a single site in
the plastid would respond to the mutator activity, one would expect
that the direct or indirect product of the inducer gene carries an
extremely sophisticated information, capable of recognition of
nucleotide sequences consisting probably of many residues. At the
moment, we know about very few such macromolecules.  Perhaps the
repressors isolated from bacteria would qualify for such a job.  The
detection of such a repressor, if it exists in Arabidopsis, would
probably be feasible by technics known.  In the case of the general
type of mutability in the organelles, induced by nuclear genes, there
may be a number of equally plausible additional mechanism. The nuclear
gene may produce a chemical mutagen. The probablility for the
existence of such a compound does not seem very high because the
presence of the plastid-targeted mutator genes known in Arabidopsis so
far, does not involve increased mutability in the nucleus, in the
mitochondria, or in other detectable cytoplasmic entities.  The
nuclear gene may be just as specific in the case of the generalize
mutator (e.g., chm) as in the specialized type (e.g. am) but while in
the latter case it would have affinity for the regulatory site of a
platogene, in the former case, it may be involved in the synthesis of
the organellar ribosomes, presumably transcribed in plastid DNA, and
used for translation of organellar genetic information.  It is also
conceivable that the generalized type of mutator controls the
synthesis of the plastid DNA-polymerase. The various alternatives are
amenable to experimental tests.<p>

The cytoplasmically targeted nuclear mutators may contribute
information to cellular mechanisms of evolution. The symbiotic origin
of the cells of green plants and other higher organisms have been the
topic of numerous essays recently, yet only speculations could be
offered either for or against the hypotheses.  It may be of interest
to note that cytoplasmically targeted nuclear genes are known in a
number of higher plants (cf. KIRK and TILNEY-BASSET, 1967) yet I am
not aware of any major cytoplasmic factor which would determine
nuclear mutability in a fashion comparable to the nuclear mutators
controlling plastid mutability. Some of the mutators located in the
nucleus affect several organelles simultaneously (e.g., WETTSTEIN,
1961) thus one may gain an insight into the independence and
interdependence of the hierarchy of multiple genomes within the cell.<p>

Some very fundamental questions concerning the formal genetics of the
cytoplasmic systems need clarification. The number of chloroplasts in
the cells of Arabidopsis generally varies between 20-80, depending on
the tissue. Are we dealing here with polysomy or polyploidy?  The fact
that we can find cells with many apparently normal green plastids and
single white one, makes it difficult to interpret the observation in
these terms. The individual plastids are generally assumed to be
haploid. We do not know whether the mutants we obtain are recessive or
dominant.  Dominant mutations in the nuclear genes are very rare yet
the abundant mutations induced by the chm locus appear rather of the
dominant type.  Presumably the genetic information of the plastome
within single cells is not at all unique yet no available observation
indicate epistasis or genetic interaction within the "polysomic"
system.  Pleiotropy or linkage apparently exits, however, since
sterility and certain types of plastid alterations are generally
concomittant, and other traits appear independent.  Evidence for
crossing over in the plastome of higher plants is not available.  In
Arabidopsis the plastome is transmitted only maternally, yet the
mutator system may place numerous alterations within single cells.
Thus in principle, chances for recombination may be available and it
may be observed when the methods of detection are adequate. The
population genetics of the plastids is far from sufficiently
understood.  Neither the "one sided sorting out" (MICHAELIS, 1967) nor
the preferential segregation (TILNEY-BASET, 1970) models still can be
interpreted by alternative assumptions.<p>
