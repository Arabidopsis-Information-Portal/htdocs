PIPRA at the University of California Davis seeks a highly skilled scientist 
for a postdoctoral position opening to be filled immediately. The successful 
candidate will work in a project aimed at genetically engineering alfalfa as 
a sustainable source of protein for pet and animal feed. The primary 
research responsibilities include examination of scientific and patent 
literature to design well organized research strategies. Develop plant 
expression construct and transiently over express candidate proteins in 
plants. Purify and characterize recombinant proteins via in vitro digestion 
assays to determine the feasibility of candidate proteins as pet and animal 
feed. 
Desired qualifications include: 

* PhD in biochemistry, molecular biology, plant or animal science. 

* Excellent communication skills in English to report research data 
in oral and written formats. 

* Strong publication record. 

* Laboratory expertise in biochemistry techniques: recombinant 
protein expression, purification and biochemical characterization and in 
silico protein design; molecular biology techniques: ability to design and 
clone plant expression constructs; and microscopy techniques: sub-cellular 
localization with fluorescent tagged proteins. 

* Ability to work independently, prioritize activities and meet 
research timelines and deliverables. 
Interested candidates should send application package to: Dr. Alan Bennett
