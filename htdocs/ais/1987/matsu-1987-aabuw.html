INTRODUCTION<p>

Arabidopsis thaliana has many ideal features as a model system for
plant molecular biology, for its short life cycle, abundant mutant
stocks (Kranz and Kirchheim, 1987), and especially its small genome
size (70,000bp per haploid genome).<p>

To understand the gene organization of this plant, we screened many
genes from genomic DNA library of Arabidopsis thaliana using many
probes. During the course of the work, we were able to clone the
repeated sequence. In this report, we would like to describe the
unique repeated sequence.<p>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<p>

A genomic DNA library of Arabidopsis thaliana cloned in a
bacteriophage *lambda* was obtained from E.M. Meyerowitz (Chang and
Meyerowitz, 1986). Sequence analysis was performed according to Sanger
et al. (1977) on restriction fragments subcloned into M13 mp series
vectors (Messing and Viera, 1982).<p>

For Southern blot hybridization, seven micrograms of Arabidopsis
thaliana race Columbia genomic DNAs were digested with appropriate
restriction endonucleases, electrophoresed in agarose gel, and
transferred to nylon membrane filters.<p>

Probe DNAs were labelled with (*alpha*-32 P) dCTP by nicktranslation.
Hybridization was carried out at 42*degrees*C for 15 hours in a
solution containing 30% formamide, 6xSSC (lxSSC: 0.15M NaCl/0.015M
sodium citrate), 10x Denhardt's solution (1x Denhardt's solution:
0.02% bovine serum albumin/0.02% Ficoll-400/0/02%
polyvinyl-pyrrolidone), 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). 0.5 mg/ml
herring sperm DNA, 5x10 8-1x10 9 c.p.m./micro g DNA probe. Filters
were washed three times in a solution containing 1xSSSC/0.1% SDS at
30*degrees*C and two times in 0.2xSSSC/0.2% SDS at 37*degrees*C.<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

From the nucleotide sequence of the repeat (Figure 1) it was found to
be the tandem copies of 48 base pair repeating unit. We named this
unit "Sac" for unique SacI restriction enzyme site in the unit.<p>

Figure 1: The nucleotide sequence of repeats. Repeating units were
aligned to achieve maximal homology.<p>

The homology between each repeat and the consensus sequence is about
95% on the average. When this consensus sequence is aligned as Figure
2, the nucleotide sequence of the first half has homology (63%) the
complementary strand of the latter half. The repeat of 48 base pairs
(Sac) may be composed of inverted repeat of 24 base pairs.<p>

Figure 2: Consensus sequence was divided into two parts and the
complementary strand of the latter half was aligned to achieve maximal
homology.<p>

From the percentage of homology, it was suggested that inversion of
the 24 base pairs occured first and then the resulting 48 base pair
unit (Sac) repeated tandemly. It is uncertain whether this 24 base
pair sequence is composed of much shorter repeating units. Using this
repeated sequence as a probe, Southern blot hybridization was carried
out in a relatiely low stingent condition (see Materials and Methods).
The probe hybridized to many bands of different lengths in genomic
DNA, when the genomic DNA was digested with BamHI or EcoRI (Figure 3).
It was suggested that the repeated sequence was dispersed throughout
the Arabidopsis thaliana genome. To examine whether this repeated
sequence existed in other species, human DNA (placenta), rat DNA
(Fisher rat liver), and mouse DNA (NIH3T3) were hybridized with the
same probe in the same condition. In this experiment, however, no
hybridization sign was observed (data not shown). This repeated
sequence may only exist in plant genomes.<p>

Some repeated sequences which are dispersed in the Arabidopsis
thaliana genome have already been cloned by Pruitt (Pruitt and
Meyerowitz, 1986). We do not know whether the repeated sequence
presented here and the repeated sequence cloned by them are the same
or not, because there is no sequence data for theirs. From the
Southern blot hybridization patterns of theirs and ours, however, they
were different. Recently, human repeated sequences (minisatellite),
have come to be used as a probe for human DNA restriction fragment
length polymorphism: RFLP (Jeffreys et al., 1985). The repeated
sequence described here may also be a useful probe for RFLP of many
strains of Arabidopsis thaliana.<p>

restriction enzymes and electrophoresed in 0.7% agarose gel at 4V/cm
for 8 hours, transferred to nylon membrane filters and hybridized with
probe containing repeated sequence. X-ray films were exposed for 24
hours at -70*degrees*C with intensifying screens. *Lambda* DNA
digested with Hind III was used as a molecular weight marker. Kb: Kilo

SUMMARY<p>

A repeated sequence was closed from the genomic library of Arabidopsis
thaliana. It consists of tandem copies of 48 base pair repeating unit.
Its unit is composed of two sets of distantly related 24 base pair
sequences which are invertedly repeated within the unit. From Southern
blot hybridization of the genomic DNA using this repeating units as a
probe, it was suggested that this unit sequence was interspersed
throughout the genome.<p>

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT<p>

We thank Dr. E.M. Meyerowitz for sending the Arabidopsis thaliana
*gamma* phage library, Drs. N. Goto and J. Yamaguchi for helpful
discussions.<p>
