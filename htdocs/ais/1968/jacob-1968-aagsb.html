Actinomycin D, which is known as an inhibitor of DNA dependent RNA
synthesis (HURWITZ et al., 1962) has proved to be a useful tool for
the study of gene action (REICH and GOLDBERG, 1964).  The
morphological and biochemical alterations induced by this antibiotic
on the embryonic development of amphibians and on the growth of
Acetabularia have been studied by BRACHET and his collaborators
(BRACHET, 1965).  In higher plants, mitosis in root meristem of Allium
cepa is blocked and differentiation of prevascular tissue disturbed in
the presence of actinomycin (BAL and GROSS, 1963).<p>

In Arabidopsis we have tested the influence of actinomycin D upon the
incorporation of tritiated uridine (specific activity 760 mc/mM;
Radiochemical Centre, Amersham) in seeds immersed in a solution which
contained 3H-uridine at a concentration of 20 micro c/ml in
combination with two concentrations of actinomycin, 50 and 100 micro
g/ml respectively.  The results refer to the sum of radioactivity
found at intervals of several hours in the acido-insoluble fractions
obtained through a modified scheme of the procedure of SCHMIDT and
THANNHAUSER (1945).  The figure shows the expected incorporation into
the acidoinsoluble fractions.  A depression of RNA synthesis appeared
only for the highest concentration (100 micro g/ml) of actinomycin, 25
hrs after sowing when the rate of incorporation suddenly increases in
the case of the control seeds.  It is also of interest to note that
actinomycin inhibits not only the incorporation but also the
penetration of the labelled riboside into the seeds.<p>

Culture of Arabidopsis on mineral medium including actinomycin in a
range of concentrations from 30 to 100 micro g/ml shows in relation to
these concentrations, a lot of perturbations, e.g., reduction of
leaves surface, delay in development, partial bleaching of the leaves
specially for the young ones and mortality.  This inhibition of growth
can be related to the decrease of RNA synthesis.  Studies on the
effects of this antibiotic on DNA and protein metabolism are now
underway.<p>
