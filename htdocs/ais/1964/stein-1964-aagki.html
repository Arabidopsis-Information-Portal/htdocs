Vol 01<h2>STEINITZ-SEARS, L.M.</h2><h2>Cytological studies in Arabidopsis</h2>

The chiasma frequency at MI in normal diploid Arabidopsis was found to
be 1.83 per chromosome, or 82% ring and 18% rod bivalents.<p>

The line K 16, a spontaneous autotetraploid, had 2n=20 chromosomes,
determined at TI, and at least one individual had 2n=20 + 1.  Meiotic
configurations have not yet been worked out in detail.<p>

MIO is very variable line containing hexaploids.  Of six individuals
analysed one each had 2n=17, 18, 22, and 30 while the other two had
more than 30 chromosomes.  The meiotic configurations were complex:
one individual had 4IV 2II in most of its PMC's but 10II in some.
Another plant had 2IV 1III 3II in several cells.  The following data
were obtained incidentally in the search for the five primary
trisomics.<p>

Chromosome umbers in PMC's of 96 offspring (F2 + F3) (from 1 cross 4n
x 2n)

2n =            10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 
Frequency       40 31  5  1  3  3  4  3  2  1  3

The plants analysed were not sampled at random; on the one hand care
was taken to include all seedlings marked "different from normal" in
the sample, on the other more plants were sampled than analysable
meiotic preparations obtained.<p>

The paucity of seedlings with higher chromosome numbers may be due to
the following three factors:<p>

1.  Pairing in triploids is often irregular with consequent lagging
and loss of chromosomes.<p>

2. Pollen containing the normal chromosome number of 5 is vastly
favored over that with extra chromosomes.<p>

3. Seedlings with unbalanced chromosome constitution may not survive
long enough to be sampled in meiosis.<p>
