IN VIVO LABELLING OF PLANT PROTEINS AND 
IMMUNOPRECIPITATION (This was placed on the electronic 
Arabidopsis bulletin board; July 1992.)

*  The following is a summary of replies I received regarding in vivo 
labelling of plant proteins and immunoprecipitation.  There are 
several methods of labelling the proteins, one protocol for cell lysis 
and protein recovery, and two suggestions for carrying out the 
immunoprecipitation.

1.  LABELLING WITH 35S  *  Paint the 35S on leaves in a solution of 
0.05% Triton X-100, preferably on the underside  because of the 
presence of more stomata. (Chris Sommerville)

 *  Paint with 35S methionine in a solution of 0.02% Tween20, allow it 
to be taken up for 4 h.  (Sarah Gilmour)

 *  Cut leaf with sharp razor blade and place in 35S met/cys ("EXPRE" 
from NEN or TRANS-label  from ICN) for 1 h.  The label is diluted to 
1.4 mCiml-1.  This method was found to work better  than painting 
label on leaves, getting 400,000 dpm total from one leaf.  (Carrie 
Schneider)

 *  Place detached leaves in eppendorf tubes with a short vacuum 
infiltration (Plant Physiol.  88,731.  Note error in M&M, use 20ul, not 
209ul of H2O.  (Tim Caspar)

 *  For labeling whole plants, use 35S sulphate instead of labelled 
amino acids.  Put seedlings  just geminated in small puddles of S35 
suphate for 2, 3 or 4 days. (Russell Malmberg)

2.  HOMOGENISATION AND IMMUNOPRECIPITATION   (i) Freeze 
tissue in liquid N2.   (ii) Homogenize in 2ml of (0.7M sucrose, 0.5M 
Tris 9.4, 50mM EDTA, 0.1M KCl, 2% mercaptoethanol, 2mM PMSF: 
from Hurkman and Tanaka, Plant Physiol. (1986) 81, 802). Use a 
glass homogenizer.   (iii) Add 2ml phenol, shake.  Spin to separate 
and retain phenol phase.   (iv) Add 5 volumes of 0.1M NH4OAc in 
methanol.  Precipitate o/n in freezer.  Spin out proteins.   (v) Wash 
pellet with 80% acetone and dry.  Resuspend in 1% SDS and boil for 
1 min.   (vi) Add 7 volumes of (50mM Tris 7.8, 1% Triton-X-100), spin 
out insolubles.   (vii) Add antibody to this.  Precipitate the antibody 
with 1% crosslinked Stapholococcus A cells.   (viii) Wash the 
precipitate with (50mM Tris 7.5, 150mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA).   (ix) 
Resuspend in Laemmli buffer and load gel.  (Carrie Schneider).

3.  IMMUNOPRECIPITATION Any standard protocol will get you 
started, but I would urge you to optimise each reagent.  We found 
that we could greatly reduce the amounts of killed Staph A cells, the 
amounts of rabbit-anti- mouse, and the initial amounts of the specific 
monocloncal we were using.  When you think you have each of these 
reasonably optimised, do a dose response of the amount of protein 
in the supernatant and the amount in the pellet as a function of 
increasing specific antibody.  This will give you a dose of your 
antibody that should work for routine assays.  We particularly found 
that bridge antibodies (such as the rabbit anti-mouse) are particularly 
important to optimise, since bunnies and other animals usually 
contain antibodies that recognize some plant epitopes.

4.  IMMUNOPRECIPITATION DOSE RESPONSE CURVE   (i) Plant 
extract

  (ii) 50 mM Hepes

  (iii) Hepes-BSA 50 mM Hepes, 1% BSA

  (iv) Washed pansorbin cells (Calbiochem) Remove 55 ul pansorbin 
cells Spin down, resuspend in 55 ul Hepes-BSA Repeat 3 times. Let 
sit on ice at least 1 h.

  (v) Rabbit anti-mouse dilute 10x into Hepes-BSA (need 10 ul)

  (vi) Monoclonal dilute 100x into Hepes-BSA  (need 14 ul) dilute 10x 
into Hepes-BSA (need 13 ul straight, undiluted (need 13 ul)

  (vii) Gently mix the following, then incubate on ice for 60 minutes  A

  (viii) Add 1 ul diluted rabbit anti-mouse to each tube.  Gently mix, 
then incubate on ice for 1 hour.   (ix) Add 5 ul Pansorbin to each tube.  
Gently mix, then incubate on ice for 1 hr.   (x) Wash by spinning down 
and resuspending in 100 ul Hepes-BSA. Repeat four times.   (xi)
