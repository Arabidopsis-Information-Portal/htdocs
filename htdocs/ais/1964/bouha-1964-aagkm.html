Vol 01:<h2>BOUHARMONT, J</h2><h2>Action of x-rays on an autopolyploid series in Arabidopsis</h2>

Tetra-, hexa- and octoploid forms have been induced by colchicine in a
diploid local variety of Arabidopsis.  The reaction of the four
chromosomal races was studied after irradiation of seedlings by
several doses of X-rays (5, 10, and 20kr).  Growth retardation and
morphological aberrations of the treated plants were more marked after
stronger irradiations and some differences appeared between the
various forms.  The dosis of 20 kr alone was partly lethal for diploid
and tetraploid forms, while all hexaploid and octoploid plants died
with 20 kr and some others with 10 kr.  The frequency of chlorophyll
mutants is investigated at the second generation.  The first
observations indicate a decrease of the number of the mutant seedlings
with increasing chromosome number.<p>
