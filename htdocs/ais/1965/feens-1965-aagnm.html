Substrate: Fine grain perlite for sterile culture in petridishes.
Dishes + dry perlite can be sterlised in an oven; sterile nutrient
solution added afterwards in a sterile cabinet.  Solution should be
poured in slowly.  The composition of the medium can be changed at a
later moment by adding a (concentrated) solution of additional
compounds, e.g., a minimal medium may be altered into a complete one.<p>

Seed sterilisation: Hydrogen peroxyde/ethanol (LANGRIDGE 1957) gave
better results than 3 1/2% calcium hypochlorite solution.<p>

Seed planting: If planting of individual seeds is required, "vacuum
tweezers" are useful, especially on perlite surface. Apparatus can be
made by drawing out piece of capillary glass tubing. Entrance diameter
1/2 - 3/4 of seed diameter.  Other side of tube is inserted in piece
of rubber vacuum tubing, which has a hole in the wall, in which a
small piece of glass tubing is inserted (side tube).  The other end of
the rubber tubing is connected (preferably by a rather flexible piece
of tubing) to a vacuum pump (water jet pump).  By covering and
uncovering of the side tube by a finger, vacuum can be made and
released resp.  Dry or wet seeds can be picked up very easily even
from a wet surface (e.g., glass-sinter filter used for seed
sterilisation).<p>

Conditions during growth: When petridishes are illuminated, care
should be taken to keep the temperature inside at the desired level.
Cooling may be necessary, this can be achieved by placing the dishes
on a zinc tray floating on water, the temperature of which is
controlled.  Cooling from below has the advantage that no condensation
takes place on the lids.<p>

In order to allow normal flower stem formation, the lids are removed
when the flower buds become visible, and the bottom-dishes are placed
in glass jars (preserving-jars are cheap), which are covered by the
lid of a larger sized petridish. Although rel. humidity is 100%,
reasonable seed-set takes place.<p>
