Vol 01:<h2>ADAMS, M.W.</h2><h2>Studies on growth and development of several races of Arabidopsis thaliana</h2>

Hypocotyl growth rate - mean values and variation.  Material: Selfed
progeny of single plants coming from seed lots received from
LANGRIDGE, Canberra. Races: Catania (Sicily); Tsu (Japan); Graz
(Austria); Langen (Germany); Martuba (North Africa); Stockholm
(Sweden).  Procedure: Post-dormancy seeds were wetted, placed in petri
plates, cold-treated at -5*degrees*C for three days, and placed on 2%
sterile nutrient agar at 18*degrees*C in the dark for the duration of
the experiments, except for periodic removal for hypocotyl
measurements.  Forty seeds of each lot were measured.  The results
were as follows:<p>

Comparison of hypocotyl growth rates and coefficients of variation of
homozygous lines and some of their F1 hybrids.  (Procedure as before,
except this was another experiment; so data are not the same for the
lines).  The results were as follows:<p>
