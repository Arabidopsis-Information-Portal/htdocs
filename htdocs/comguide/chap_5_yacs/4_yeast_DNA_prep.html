*  This protocol was developed to isolate total yeast DNA in a rapid way.  
The quality of the DNA obtained is sufficient for digestions with various 
restriction enzymes and is successfully used in the IPCR protocol 
described by Ian Bancroft.

1.  SOLUTION & MEDIUM
  (i) TE/SDS
0.4% SDS
75mM Tris - HCl, pH 7.5
40mM EDTA, pH 8.0

  (ii) YEPD-MEDIUM (l-1)
10 g  Bacto-yeast extract
20 g Bacto-peptone
20 g Glucose
100 mg adenine
 *  Agar medium is solidified with 2% Bacto-agar.

2.  PROCEDURE
  (i) Grow yeast cells o/n. at 30oC in 25 ml liquid YEPD medium 
(inoculated from YEPD agar plates).
  (ii) Harvest cells by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min.
  (iii) Resuspend cells in 400 ul TE/SDS.
  (iv) Freeze resuspended cells in liquid N2.
  (v) Transfer frozen cells to 65oC and incubate for 30 min.
  (vi) Cool on ice, add 100 ul of cold 4M KAc, incubate on ice 15 - 30 min.
  (vii) Spin down debris,10 min.
  (viii) Transfer supernatant to fresh tube, add 2 vol of ethanol, place on 
ice for 5 min.
  (ix) Collect precipitate by centrifugation for 5 min, wash pellet with 70 % 
ethanol and (without drying) dissolve in 100 ul TE.
  (x) To remove residual SDS, centrifuge preparation for 10 min and 
transfer supernatant to microcentrifuge tube.  Extract with 
phenol/chloroform/IAA and reprecipitate the DNA with ethanol.
