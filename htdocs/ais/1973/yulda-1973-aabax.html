For the interpretation of the biological effects of laser irradiation
the following parameters are to be considered: wave length, percussion
wave, energy density and heat. The role of heat and energy density
were analized in this paper.<p>

Air-dried seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) HEYNH. were irradiated by
a ruby laser (*gamma* = 6943A) in conditions of free generation - C
(thermal factor is clearly expressed), and with modulated quality - Q
(thermal factor is less expressed).<p>

The survival of plants to the stage of the first two leaves formation
has been determined.<p>

Figure 1 shows that the rate of plant destruction under Q-conditions
(counts period tau = 10**-9 sec. ) is considerably higher than under
C-conditions (counts period tau = 10**-3 sec.).  The obsrvations on
the limits of tolerance determined for both irradiation conditions are
comparable.  100% destruction of plants subsected to C-conditions was
observed at the dose 24 J/cm2, and under Q-conditions at 10-11 J/cm2.
Thus laser irradiation generated under Q-conditions has a greater
biological efficiency.  Consequently, heat effects are not the most
important among the biological effects of laser irradition.<p>

Figure 2 demonstrates significant differences between the biological
effects of the concentrated and the fractioned irradiation of seeds
(no activity!).<p>

Figure 2: The effects of energy density on the survival of A. thaliana
plants.<p>

Experiments on the effects of energy density revealed the threshold of
effective doses of laser irradiation, at which the biological effects
begin: in C-generation conditions the effect begins at impulse energy
3.5 J/cm2, in Q-conditions-at 1.6 J/cm2.<p>
