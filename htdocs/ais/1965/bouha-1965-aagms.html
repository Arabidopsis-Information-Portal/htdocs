AIS Vol 02:<h2>Action of X-rays on the apical meristems of diploid and polyploid Arabidopsis</h2><p>

Previous experiments have indicated a lower radiosensitivity of
tetraploid plants of Arabidopsis thaliana, in comparison to diploid
ones, but a higher sensitivity of hexaploid (and octoploid) forms.  In
order to understand the origin of the seedling lethality, apical
meristems of diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid forms have been
observed, on axial sections, after X irradiation.  One day after the
treatment, a number of meristematic cells became deeply stained with
hematoxylin.  These destroyed cells were not distributed at random in
the whole apex, but were very numerous in the second layer of the
tunica and much sparser in the first one.  Some degenerated cells were
isolated, others were clumped.  Their frequency and density were
especially high in the middle of tunica 2 and at the top of the
corpus.<p>

Three different experiments have given the following rates of
degenerted cells:<p>

Five day seedlings (5 days after sowing) have received a dose of
15.000 r, older plants have received 20.000 r.  In the third
experiment (20.000 r), diploid and tetraploid plants were 11 days old,
and hexaploid were 3 days older, in order to observe the seedlings
nearly at the same stage before inflorescence initiation.  In each
experiment, the three forms were sowed (except the 6 x in the third
case), cultivated, irradiated and fixed at the same time.<p>

The percentages given above are the proportions of degenerated cells
occurring in the two layers of the tunica and in the corpus.  They
show the higher sensibility of tunica 2 and the resistance of the
epidermal layer.  The percentage of degenerated cells appears to be
higher in polypoloids, at least for the 11 day old plants.  On the
other hand, the data given for the second and third experiments are
clearly different for diploid and tetraploid seedlings.<p>
