*  We have isolated RNA from a range of plant species (e.g., lettuce, pea, 
Pharbitis and wheat) and types of tissue (leaves, cotyledons, seeds and 
floral tissue).  These methods have now been used to isolate total RNA 
and mRNA from Arabidopsis thaliana.  They have proved satisfactory for 
isolating undegraded RNA that has been used to construct cDNA 
libraries, carry out in vitro translation and analyse RNA transcripts by 
Northern blotting.  Yields for both of these methods are 200-300 ugg-1 
fresh weight of Arabidopsis leaf tissue, depending upon the age and 
growth conditions of the plants.

*  With all procedures for the isolation of intact RNA it is extremely 
important to ensure that equipment and reagents are RNAase free.  We 
routinely use diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) treated water, baked 
glassware and sterile polypropylene tubes.  Molecular biological grade 
reagents are used when available or alternatives of the highest quality.

1.  SOLUTIONS
  (i) EXTRACTION BUFFER
50mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)
4% (w/v) p-Aminosalicylate
1% (w/v) tri-isopropylnaphthalene sulphonate, sodium salt (Phase 
Separations Ltd)
2% (v/v) b-Mercaptoethanol.

  (ii) PHENOL REAGENT
50mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) saturated phenol (containing 0.1% [w/v] 8-
hydroxyquinoline):chloroform:iso-amyl alcohol (25:24:1 [v/v/v]).
 *  Glass distilled aqueous phenol is supplied by Rathburn Chemicals Ltd 
(Walkerburn, Scotland).
 *  Due to the caustic nature of phenolic compounds care should be  
taken in the use of this  reagent and extractions should be in a fume 
cupboard.

   (iii) LiCl
12.0M LiCl (filter sterile)

  (iv) CsCl BUFFERS
40% CsCl in 10mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) 5.7M CsCl
1.0mM EDTA 0.1M EDTA (pH 7.5)
 *  The solution is treated with DEPC and autoclaved after 30 min (Take 
care with DEPC).

2.  SMALL SCALE PREPARATION
  (i) Grind 1 g fresh weight of leaf tissue to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen 
using a mortar and pestle.
  (ii) Transfer the powder to sterile Corex tubes (Dupont), containing an 
10 ml each of phenol reagent and extraction buffer.
  (iii) Blend the mixture at three quarter speed for 2 min using the small 
probe (S25 N10G) attachment for an ultra-turrax (Sartorius).
  (iv) Centrifuge in a Sorvall SS34 rotor for 20 min at 7,000rpm (5,864xg).
  (v) Carefully remove the upper aqueous phase to a sterile 
polypropylene tube.  Re-extract the lower phase with an equal volume of 
extraction buffer and pool the aqueous phases.
  (vi) Precipitate the nucleic acids by addition of 0.1 vol of 3M sodium 
acetate (pH5.6) and 2.2 vol of ethanol -20oC.
  (vii) Mix gently and leave for >2 h at -20oC.
  (viii) Collect the nucleic acid precipitate by centrifugation in a Sorvall 
SS34 rotor at 13,000 rpm (20,190xg) for 30 min.
  (ix) Discard the supernatant.  Briefly dry the pellet before resuspending 
it in (usually 500 ul ) water for LiCl or in 40% CsCl buffer forCsCl method 
(see below)
 *  Any undissolved material will go into solution on addition of more 
water.  However, it is  important not to dilute the nucleic acid 
concentration substantially as the efficiency of  subsequent LiCl 
precipitations can be reduced.

  (x) Transfer the nucleic acid solution into 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes.
 *  RNA can now be selectively isolated using either LiCl or CsCl.

3.  LiCl ISOLATION OF RNA
 *  LiCl selectively precipitates large mw ribosomal and mRNA from DNA 
and small mw tRNA.

  (i) Add LiCl to the total nucleic acid solution to a final concentration of 
>2M.
  (ii) Leave o/n on ice and then collect the precipitated RNA by 
centrifugation in a microfuge.
  (iii) Wash the precipitate with 3.0M sodium acetate (pH 5.6).  To remove 
any small amounts of contaminating DNA.
  (iv) After centrifugation, discard the supernatant.  Remove the sodium 
acetate by washing in 70% ethanol (-20oC).
  (v) Dry the RNA under vacuum for 1.5 min and resuspend in sterile 
water.
  (vi) Scan the RNA absorbance from 320 nm to 220 nm.
 *  An absorbance at 260 nm of 1.0 is equivalent to 40 ug ml-1 and the 
260:280 ratio should be  approximately 2.0 for pure RNA.  Absorbance 
at 230 nm is indicative of carbohydrate/  polyphenol contamination.

4.  CsCl ISOLATION OF RNA
 *  The main advantage of this method is that a number of samples can 
conveniently be  prepared together.

  (i) Resuspend the total nucleic acid precipitate in <3 ml of 40% CsCl 
buffer
  (ii) Place 1 ml of this solution into a 4.2 ml polyallomer tube and underlay 
with 1 ml of 5.7M CsCl.
  (iii) Fill the tubes with the rest of the nucleic acid solution to within 2 mm
of the top of the tube. 
  (iv) Centrifuge in a Beckmann SW 60Ti rotor at 31,000 rpm (100,000xg) 
o/n.
  (v) Remove the supernatant.  Resuspend the precipitate in 300 ul of 
10mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5mM EDTA and 0.1% (w/v) SDS.
  (vi) Transfer the solution to an Eppendorf tube and spin briefly.
  (vii) Reprecipitate the RNA by the addition of 3M sodium acetate 
(pH5.6) and 2.2 vol of ethanol.
  (viii) Wash the pellet in 70% ethanol.  Dry, resuspended and scan as 
above.
