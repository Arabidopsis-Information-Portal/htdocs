	The germination of soaked seeds can be inhibited by various means, e.g., by anaerobiosis or by drying. This gives the possibility to interpose a storage period between mutagenic treatment and replication of DNA.  Submersion of Arabidopsis seeds in water creates partially anaerobic conditions which are sufficient to inhibit germination. At 24*degrre*C this "water storage" may be continued up to 5 or 7 days without loss of germinability (cf. MULLER, 1965b, 1967).  "Dry storage" of Arabidopsis seeds may be continued for years without loss of germinability provided the soaking before drying has been carried out under anaerobic conditions or, if under aerobic conditions, only for a period not exceeding 20 hrs (at 24*degrees*C).<p>

	Experiments with E M S*:  Anaerobically presoaked seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana (Dijon G) were treated for 3 hrs at 24*degrees*C with 50 mM EMS and then washed and submersed in distilled water for 1 hr or 24 hrs respectively.  After the "water storage" the seeds were either germinated immediately or dried over silica-gel at 24*degrees*C and germinated after various periods of "dry storage".  The frequency of recessive lethals was determined by the embryo test. The results are summarized in the figure (upper curves:  embryonic lethals and chlorophyll mutations; lower curves:  chlorophyll mutations only; 14 hrs of dry storage after 1 hr of water storage led to almost completely sterile M1 plants). In another experiment (see table) the effect of post treatment with 20 mM cystine on the EMS-induced mutation frequency was tested.<p>

	Experiments with other mutagens are summarized in the table.  (In each case anaerobically presoaked seeds of A. thaliana "Dijon G" were treated.)<p>

	From the results the following conclusions may be drawn:  (1) Delaying the germination by post treatment storage in water (anaerobiosis) does not influence the fixation of premutational lesions induced by EMS, iPMS, NMH or NMG.  This confirms previous results with NMH (MULLER, 1965b) and EMS (MULLER, 1966).  (2)  Cysteine given after the mutagenic treatment is expected to react with the mutagenic agent still present in the seeds at the post-treatment-storage period. Accordingly, cystein post-treatment reduced the mutation frequency in the case of the slowly reacting EMS, but not in the case of the rapidly reacting iPMS and NMG.  (3) The increase of mtuation frequency while storing EMS-treated seeds in a redesiccated condition has to be ascribd to reactions of EMS still present in the seeds after 1 hr of "water storage".  It is prevented completely by soaking the treated seeds in water for 24 hrs.  Previous results (MULLER, 1966) indicated that 11 hrs of post-treatment soaking at 24*degrees*C is sufficient for this purpose.  Accordingly, with the rapidly reacting iPMS a "storage effect" could not be demonstrated.  (4) Drying of soaked seeds immediately after treatment with X-rays increases the frequency of induced mutations.  (5) In addition to previous results with NMH (MULLER, 1965a) it is shown that drying of seeds treated with various nitrosamides drastically decreases the frequency of induced mutations.  The finding that this effect of drying is not influenced by the duration of "water storage" interposed between treatment and drying indicates that the nitrosamides induce a specific kind of premutational lesions which are stable under the conditions of "water storage", but reversible by drying. The premutational lesions induced by alkyl methanesulfonates or X-rays are obviously not reversible by drying.<p>
