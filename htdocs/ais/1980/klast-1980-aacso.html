INTRODUCTION<p>

Arabidopsis thaliana has the lowest nuclear DNA content recorded so
far in higher plants and its haploid genome is only about 50 times
larger than that of Escherichia coli (Nagl, 1978). This explains, why
the five chromosome pairs have been considered too small for meiotic
studies and why only few papers dealing with Arabidopsis meiosis have
been published so far (Steinitz-Sears, 1962, 1963, 1966, 1968;
Lee-Chen and Sears, 1969; Sears and Lee-Chen, 1970; Mesicek, 1971;
Ramulu and Sybenga, 1979). The pachytene chromosomes have been
described as being "poorly defined and ghostlike" (Sears and Lee-Chen,
1970). In all remaining studies on Arabidopsis meiosis, the evaluation
has been limited only to the metaphase and anaphase stages.<p>

The acetocarmine and acetoorcein staining technique, used by all
Arabidopsis cytologists, are unfavorable for meiotic prophase studies
in general. A Giemsa technique used in our laboratory is superior in
revealing the details of meiotic prophase especially in plants with
small chromosomes.<p>

As has been already discussed in our earlier papers (Klastrska, 1977;
Klasterska and Ramel, 1979, 1980) the interpretation of the prophase
stages and their sequence is a source of difficulties in plant
meiosis. The time of homologue synapsis is the synizesis described
already by the early cytologists. But this stage later became
eliminated from the meiotic descriptions as fixation artefact and
zytogene became mixed up with early diplotene (for more details see
Klasterska and Ramel, 1979).<p>

MATERIAL AND METHODS<p>

The inflorescences of Arabidopsis thaliana wild type En-2 (2n=10) were
fixed in absolut ethanol: glacial acetic acid (3:1) and stored in the
refrigerator for 1-3 days.<p>

For preparation, the anthers were dissected from the bud under the
stereomicroscope. A mouth-controlled Pasteur micropipette (drawn to
the appropriate thinness in a flame) was used in order to transfer the
very small anthers to a drop of 45% acetic acid on a slide one by one.
The anthers were then heated, squashed and frozen on dry ice. After
removing the cover glass, the slides were put for some minutes in
absolute ethanol and then transferred to 70% ethanol. The slides were
stained thereafter in the following way: they were transferred for
about 5 min to distilled water, and then treated for 5 min in
saturated Ba(OH)2 solution at room temperture. Thereafter they were
washed in running water for 30 min, incubated for 2 hours at
65*degrees*C in 2 x SSC (0.3 M NaCl + 0,03 M sodium citrate 1:1),
rinsed in distilled water and stained with 5% Giemsa solution (Merck)
in Sorensen buffer at pH 6.8, air dried and mounted in euparal.<p>

RESULTS<p>

The meiosis in one anther of Arabidopsis thaliana is synchronised to
such a degree, that only a short part of meiotic prophase is found in
one anther (premeiotic interphase + leptotene; leptotene + synizesis;
synizesis + early to middle pachytene to late pachytene; early
diplotene + second contraction + late diplotene; late diplotene +
diakinesis + metaphase 1). In this way, the sequence of prophase
stages is easily established.<p>

After the premeiotic interphase (Figure 1A), the chromosomes appear as
fine leptotene threads (Figure 1B) which successively are pulled
together into the synizetic knot, including the nucleolus (Figure 1C,
D, E). This stage was called by the early cytologists synizesis or
first contraction. Sometimes the chromosomes appear as being
associated by their ends (Figure 1C, D, arows) and we have suggested
that these associations may be the starting points of the homologue
synapsis (Klasterska and Ramel, 1979). At the end of synizesis, the
homologues are already paired (Firgure 1E, arrows). During the middle
and late pachytene the bivalents unravel (Figure 1 F, G) and then
start to separate (early diplotene, Figure 1H). It seems that the
chromosomes decontract somewhat after the separation of homologues
(diffuse stage) but the size of the dhromosomes is too small for this
to be discerned accurately (Figure 2A). The thin threads concentrate
then to the middle of the nucleus into a configuration named by the
early cytologists "the second contraction" (Figure 2B, C). The
bivalents, which after the second contraction progressively reappear
are first interonnected (Figure 2D, E, F, 3A, B) but the
interconnections later disappear (Figure 3C, D). The anaphase 1 and
anaphase 2 chromosomes (Figure 3E,F) are very small but distinct.<p>

DISCUSSION<p>

The interpretation of all meiotic prophase stages and their sequence
has already been discussed in our earlier publication (Klasterska and
Ramel, 1979). In this paper we only wish to complete this discussion.<p>

In electronmicroscopical studies in plants and animals, the
chromosomes have been found to be attached to the nuclear membrane,
which is considered as a transport vehicle for the chromosomes (Moens,
1973a). The bouquet arrangement of zygotene nuclei known for a long
time as a characteristic of animal meiosis is due to the attachment of
the chromosome ends to a limited part of the nuclear membrane near the
nucleolus. During the early to late pachytene, the attachments of the
bivalent ends move apart on the surface of the nucleus (Moens, 1973b;
Rasmussen, 1976).<p>

The same situation has recently been found in electron-microscopical
studies on plant meiosis. In Zea mays and Lilium longiflorum, the
telomeres of the zygotene chromosomes are attached to a small portion
of the nuclear envelope adjacent to the nucleolus (Gillies, 1975;
Holm, 1977), whereas the ends of the pachytene bivalents appear
randomly located around the nuclear envelope (Gillies, 1975). These
observations are incompatible with the concept of freely distributed
zygotene chromosomes (Darlington, 1935, 1965), but they agree very
well with the older interpretation of meiotic stages (Sharp, 1926).
The zygotene chromosomes fixed by their ends to a limited part of the
nuclear membrane are probably extended in the living nucleus and
collapse to that part of the nuclear membrane, to which they are
attached, under influence of the fixative. In this sense, synizesis
probably is a fixation artefact, but this is irrelevant for the
identification of synizesis as a true meiotic stage, during which the
homologues synapse. This is also the original interpretation of Belar
(1928), who regarded synizesis as modified by the effect of the
fixative but at the same time, he accepted synizesis as a true meiotic
stage during which the homologues pair. Only later, synizesis was
elminated from meiotic descriptions as a fixation artefact with the
consequences that early diplotene became confounded with zygotene (for
discussion see Klasterska and Rame, 1979).<p>

The successive untwisting of bivalents at the middle and late
pachytene, easily observed in meiosis of all plants studied,
apparently reflects the movement of bivalent attachments on the
nuclear membrane.<p>

The appearance of the cells at the stage called in the old
descriptions "the second contraction" may most probably be modified by
the fixative, too. Nevertheless, (1) we observed cells of this
characteristic appearance quite regularly and at a specific time also
in meiosis of Tirritis, Alliaria, Najas, Pisum and Allium, (2) in
these plants, it is possible to follow the progressive change from the
diffuse stage (in Allium, where the diffuse stage is missing, from
pachytene) to the "second contraction" stage, and from the "second
contraction" to the diplotene. (3) This stage was repeatedly reported
in various plants by the early cytologists. Therefore, the regular
appearance of this stage must reflect some regualar processes to a
definite point during meiosis, irrespective of the degree to which its
appearance may or may not be modified by the fixtion.<p>

There is a possibility that the "second contraction" simply indicates
the moment of the release of chromosome attachments from the nuclear
membrane and as the chromosomes become free, they collapse under the
influence of fixation, to the middle of the cell. But the early
drawings of the second contraction (e.g., Mottier, 1907) and our
observations on Allium meiosis (unpublished results) which confirm the
picture of Motier (1907), indicate that the movement of postpachytene
chromosomes may be regulated in some way. Moreover, in meiosis of all
plants we have studied, the ends of the late pachytene chromosomes
always seem free, whereas the bivalents reappearing after the second
contraction are temporaly interconnected by threads which usually
disappear before diakinesis or metaphase. Also these obervations
support the opinion, that the second contraction ought to reflect some
regulation of the chromosomal movements. But as all information on the
movement of postpachytene chromosomes is still lacking, more data must
be collected before any hypothesis can be suggested.<p>

SUMMARY<p>

All metiotic prophase stages are demonstrated in pollen meiosis of
Arabidopsis thaliana. The role of the chromosomal attachment to the
nuclear membrane for the appearance of the prophase stages is
discussed. Arabidopsis meiosis provides further indications that the
current concept of the meiotic prophase in plants is incomplete and
requires a revision.<p>
