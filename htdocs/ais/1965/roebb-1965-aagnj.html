Formerly in the Institute in Gottingen seed-stocks were kept in a
cellar-room at 16-18*degrees*C in a locker (80x50x60 cm) on the bottom
of which each week newly dried silicagel had been spread in a flat
layer. After some time, however, it showed that the seeds so stored
had a germination capacity inferior to those left in the greenhouse
for the same time-interval. The normal germination activity was
regained only after a 14 days' storage in the greenhouse.  This
finding brought about the following investigations.<p>

As is well known (KUGLER 1951, LAIBACH 1956) freshly harvested seeds
of may of the Arabidopsis races exhibit a distinct dormancy.  Seeds of
the race Enkheim (En-2) derived from ripe shedding pods were placed on
wet filterpaper (or soil) for various days after harvest.  The half of
the total number of petridishes was transferred twice in a
refrigerator for breaking of dormancy by an intermittent
cold-treatment (20*degrees*C - 4*degrees*C - 20*degrees*C -
4*degrees*C - 20 *degrees*C each for 12 h).  Then cultivated at 20
*degrees*C for altogether 10 days under continuous illumination the
following germination percentages were received in an average of 6
replications of 100 seeds each:<p>

The race En-2 investigated thus sows a dormancy up to about 50 days
(cf. deviating results of REINHOLZ 1947).  The cold-treatment used
shortens this period of time to nearly the half.  In the parallel
sowing on soil in the greenhouse with cultivation conditions as
similar as those for plants sown on filterpaper, the initial sprouting
inhibition proved to be much more pronounced.<p>

In a second experiment 14 days old seeds of En-2 were stored for
various periods of time at 20*degrees*C in evacuated desiccators over
the following saturated solutions establishing the different
humidities of 5% with P205, 10% with ZnC12, 58% with NaBr, 86% with
KC1, and 88% with K2Cr04.  Seeds were removed from these desiccators
after different storage times and sown on filterpaper; after 10 days
at 20*degrees*C the following germination percentages were counted
from 3 x 100 seeds:<p>

* In a parallel test with the same sample of seeds the germination was
increased by cold-treatment to 73%.<p>

Desiccated seeds stored for 69 days under 5 and 10% rel.  humidity
resp. were transferred into the desiccator with 58% and after
different intervals sown on filterpaper.  The germination percentages
after 10 days then were the following:<p>

From the foregoing experiments it might be concluded that the
after-ripening processes in Arabidopsis seeds are retarded under very
dry conditions. Similarly storage in high humidity prevents seeds from
gaining a sufficient germination capacity at least in the time-span
tested.  This is in accord with the common observation that fresh
seeds immediately sown will not sprout even when seeds of the same
source stored under medial moisture conditions have long reached their
full germination capacity.  A rel. humidity in the atmosphere of about
40-50% which can be adjusted easily with a small air-conditioning
machine, therefore seems to be suitable for the after-ripening
processes as well as for the maintenance of a good readiness for
immediate germination of Arabidopsis seeds.  This is also indicated
with the following date of a germination test with seeds (race En-2)
of different age (number of seedlings 10 days after sowing in %; for
comparison cf. NAPP-ZINN 1964, table 1):<p>
