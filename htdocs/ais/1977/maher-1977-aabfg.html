<h2>RESISTANCE TO 2,4-DICHLOROPHENOXYACETIC ACID IN ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA</h2><p>

A mutant with increased resistance to 2, 4-D has been isolated in M2
after treatment of seeds with ethylemethane-sulphonate.  M2 families
were screened on perlite moistened with nutrient medium and 3x10E-6M
2,4-D which completely inhibits root growth of the wildtype. A number
of putative resistant mutants were isolated but to date only one, 83,
which exhibited appreciable root growth has been extensively studied.<p>

In order to measure the effects of 2, 4-D on root growth seedlings
were grown on agar in a modification of the technique of Contant
(1966).  Polystyrene petri dishes (9 cm) containing 12 ml agar (0.75%
containing 0.1% KNO3) and various concentrations of 2,4-D were sown
with a single row of 22 unsterilised seeds and after a cold treatment
(4 days, 4*degrees*C) were placed at an angle of 60*degrees*C in a
growth cabinet at 26*degrees*C with continuous illumination. Root
lengths were measured at 72 hours either from projected photographs or
directly after straightening roots on the agar. The dosage response
curves for 83 (M4) and wildtype (Figure 1) shows that the mutant has
an approximately ten fold higher E.D. 50.<p>

An early problem encountered in this work was the variable growth of
83 on perlite.  On closer inspection it was found that in many cases
the roots had not penetrated the perlite but were coiled on the
surface. Even when penetration had occurred root tips could often be
seen poking up through the perlite surface.  This growth pattern was
also found after seedlings had been transplanted to soil for, unlike
wildtype, very few roots grew down and through the drainage holes of
the pots.  Moreover, if the rosette leaves were lifted, coiled roots
could be seen on the soil surface with root tips growing up through
the soil. Even so the plants flowered normally and there was no
difficulty in obtaining abundant seed if support was provided for the
inflorescence.<p>

after 72 hours on an agar dish held at an angle of 60*degrees*.  Note
the absence of a positive geotropic response by the mutants.<p>

This apparent lack of a positive geotropic response is most clearly
demonstrated when 83 is grown on agar dishes, as described above, but
without the addition of 2,4-D. Figure 2 is the tracing of a photograph
taken after 72 hours of growth of wildtype and 83 (M4) and shows the
typical features of 83 root growth-circular, clock-wise growth on the
agar surface with a lack of positive geotropic response.  In addition
Table 1 illustrates another interesting and consistent difference
between wildtype and mutant in the rate of root growth which is
significantly higher in the latter.<p>

The F1 from 83 x wildtype displays intermediate resistance to 2,4-D
but has an apparently normal geotropic response.<p>

Further analysis of this and other mutants may provide useful
information on the mode of action of growth regulators and their
interactions in the geotropic response.<p>

I wish to thank Carol Innes for excellent technical assistance. A
fuller account of this work will be presented elsewhere.<p>
