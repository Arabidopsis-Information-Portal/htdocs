We reported last year (CORCOS and LEWIS, 1971) that when whole plants
were placed in liquid media containing Heller minerals, 2% dextrose
and 6% V-8 juice, the plants usually grew into irregular balls 11 to
15 mm in diameter with numerous stems and leaves.  Parts of the balls,
when transferred in fresh medium grew into balls in about 2 weeks.
Hence, healthy growth could be maintained by transferring into fresh
medium every two weeks.<p>

Since this report was made, we have found that plants put into a V-8
juice liquid medium will give rise to offshoots with numerous roots.
These offshoots range in length from 1 to 10 mm and the long ones
remind us of small strawberry rhizomes.  They can be cut and
propagated on solid media (containing VELEMINSKY minerals + 2%
glucose) where in 2 to 3 weeks they flower and seed.  No special
precaution except sterility is necessary. The offshoot is simply laid
on the agar.<p>

Plants suspected of being mutants, that is those that are incapable of
growing normally on standard mineral + glucose medium, have been
transferred into V-8 juice media where they grew offshoots which were
propagated asexually on appropriate media.  By such a method we are
hoping to propagate more morphological mutants which in the past have
been lost because of failure to produce seeds.<p>
