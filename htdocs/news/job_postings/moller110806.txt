PhD Scholarship and Postdoctoral Positions in Plant Molecular and Cell 
Biology
Organelle Research Group, University of Stavanger, Norway
 
 
The University of Stavanger has available a three-year PhD Scholarship 
position and two three-year postdoctoral research associate positions in 
Plant Molecular and Cell Biology, in the Department of Mathematics and 
Natural Sciences. The National Functional Genomics Programme in Norway 
funds all three positions.
 
The successful applicants will be part of a research team studying the 
molecular cell biology of plastid division in Arabidopsis thaliana. We are 
particularly interested in (i) Identifying novel plastid division 
components using protein/protein interaction techniques,  (ii) Isolating 
regulatory proteins of genes encoding central plastid division proteins, 
(iii) Defining protein recruitment to plastids during division using 
quantitative proteome analysis and (iv) Cloning novel plastid division 
suppressor mutants showing altered plastid morphology. 
 
The projects are technically and intellectually demanding and applicants 
should therefore be highly motivated and have a background in plant 
molecular and cell biology.
 
The positions are salaried according to the State Salary Code: PhD 
scholarship NOK 310,700 NKr/annum (EUR 37,700/annum), Postdoctoral 
Research Associate NOK 389,600?418,400/annum (EUR 47,300- 50,800/annum). 
The positions provide for automatic membership in the Norwegian Public 
Service Pension Fund, which guarantees favorable retirement benefits. 
Members may also apply for home investment loans at favorable interest 
rates. 
 
Further information about the positions can be obtained from Professor 
Simon Geir Møller, telephone +47 51 83 17 17, e-mail 
simon.g.moller@uis.no. Project particulars and application procedures can 
be found at http://www.uis.no. When submitting an application please 
follow the guidelines given on the University website.
 
                                            Application deadline 27th of 
November 2006
