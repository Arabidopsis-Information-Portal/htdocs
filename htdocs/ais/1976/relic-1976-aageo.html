Abstract<p>

From our experiments with induction of mutations in Arabidopsis we
obtained numerous mutants, some of them are conserved and propagated
in our laboratory.<p>

In this survey of our collection 64 mutant lines are given with their
symbols and names if existing (according to the principles proposed by
MULLER, 1964) or original denotation. The description of phenotype is
not exhausting in every case; only the most characteristic change of
standard phenotype is shown because of the pleiotropic effects of
mutant alleles.  In some mutants more detailed genetic characters are
given, e.g., segregation ratio, linkage group, etc. Further we give
the dosage or concentration of the mutagen used, the original
genotype, and the generation in which the mutation was detected.<p>

Seeds of all mutant lines from this collection are available in our
department all along with those given in AIS 6, 31, 1969.<p>
