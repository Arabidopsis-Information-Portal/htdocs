Introduction<p>

Arabidopsis thaliana has been successfully used for many years as a
genetic research tool in higher plants (Redei, 1969).  Recently, it
has been shown to also be a suitable plant for somatic cell genetics
(Gresshoff, 1973; Corcos, et al., 1973).  Advances in this field are
obviously dependent upon successful in vitro morphogenesis.
Organogenesis in Arabidopsis tissue culture has been reported
(Gresshoff and Doy, 1972; Corcos, et al. 1973), but its understanding
and its control are still far from being achieved. Growth in
Arabidopsis, as in many other plant species, has been shown to be
dependent on a quantitative interaction of growth substances
(Sheridan, 1974).<p>

Totipotency can seemingly be lost under certain conditions.  For
example, a progressive decline and finally a loss of leaf formation
was reported in long term cultures (Negrutiu, et al., 1975), an
obvious drawback in the manipulation of cell cultures and in the
genetical analysis of the material.<p>

The purpose of this paper was to investigate some of the factors which
might influence the expression of the morphogenetic process, to
improve, if possible, the regeneration efficiency and to "restore" the
capacity of old callus cultures to regenerate complete plants. We
assumed that regeneration of Arabidopsis callus cultures could be
influenced by such factors as genotype (variety), origin of the
explant, hormone composition and concentration during the entire
sequence of callus culture (initiation, maintenance, and
regeneration), light and thermic shock treatments, time intervals
between subcultures, and age of and caryological evolution of the
callus in culture.  Details concerning material, culture conditions,
growth measurements, and chromosomal counts, have been reported
elsewhere (Negrutiu, et al., 1975).  Media used to induce, maintain,
and regenerate callus cultures are presented in Table 1.<p>

I.  Factors influencing in vitro morphogenesis<p>

a.  Genotype.  Clear differences in the amount of differentiation were
obsrved among the different races tested (Estland, Columbia, Wilna,
Coimbra).  Primary calluses derived from Estland seeds on PG1 medium,
and regenerated on PG3 medium, produced the highest percentage of leaf
regeneration (28-57%), but showed poor root formation.  On the
contrary, Columbia had poor leaf formation (0-21%), and strong
rhizogenesis (85-100%).  Differences were also noted among races when
other hormone ratios or other sequences of induction regeneration
media have been used.<p>

b.  Origin of the explant.  Calluses were produced from seeds; root,
stem or leaf segments; and anthers, using Estland on a PG1 medium.
Primary calluses derived from anthers, seeds, and leaves showed the
higher frequencies of leaf formation--60, 50 and 38%, respectively.
Thus, they are considered the best source of callus to establish
Arabidopsis cell and tissue cultures which have to be differentiated
later on.<p>

c.  Effect of different concentrations and combinations of kinetin and
IAA.  The effect of these hormones of regeneration reaction was tested
(Estland, primary calluses from seeds, induced on PG1).  Leaf
formation took place within the range of 10E-6 to 5 x 10E-5 M.
kinetin, and ) to 10E-6 M IAA.  Within this range, regeneration was
mostly enhanced at 10:1 kinetin to IAA (subsequently referred to as
PG3M).  At this level, the leaf and rosette formation was maximal
(38.7% as compared to 30% in the case of PG3).  On the other hand,
anther and root derived calluses regenerated better on PG3 than on
PG3M.<p>

An extremely wide range of hormone combinations and concentrations
allowed root formation to take place.  However, high kinetin
concentrations tended to decrease rhizogenesis, while IAA at levels
higher than 10E-5M, or combinations of high kinetin and auxin
concentrations maintained the callus state.<p>

d.  The sequence of callus induction-callus regeneration media.
Several sequential combinations of different callus induction media
(PG1, PG11, GD4) with different regeneration media (PG3, PG3M, G4)
were compared using primary, seed-derived calluses.  Low kinetin
callus induction media (PG1, PG11) allowed a much better subsequent
regeneration than a high kinetin callus induction medium (GD4). The
type of auxin used was also important. Coimbra gave higher
regeneration values when the callus was induced on a NAA containing
medium (PG11, 66% leaf formation), than on 2,4D (PG1, 27% leaf
formation).  Estland and Columbia showed a poor regeneration reaction
in the case of PG11-PG3 sequence. Thus sequences of callus induction
media of low kinetin content with PG3 or PG3M are more suitable for a
higher regeneration rate. In the case of anther derived calluses, the
best sequence was a Nitsch basal medium (Nitsch and Nitsch, 1969),
containing 10E-6 M kinetin + 1- E-7 M IAA, followed by regeneration on
PG3 (77% leaf formation).<p>

e.  Interval between subcultures.  The frequency of subculturing is
important for the efficiency of the ogan formation.  An eight week
subculture period prior to regeneration enabled us to increase the
percentage of leaf formation 2 to 5 times as compared to a four week
interval.  On the contrary, a long subculture interval (8 weeks)
followed by a last subculture of 4 weeks prior to regeneration does
not seem to have a positive effect on the regeneration as compared to
the control (only 4 week intervals).  Subculturing the calluses at
longer intervals (8 weeks) might increase the regeneration rate of
callus cultures.<p>

f.  Light Treatment.  Calluses induced in continuous diffuse light
(<2000 lux) or transfer of calluses in diffuse light prior to
regeneration improved the efficiency of organ formation.  For example,
50% leaf formation was obtained from Estland seed derived calluses
when callus induction took place in the dark. Seventy-five percent
leaf formation was obtained under diffuse light conditions.  A
light-dark cycle or high light intensities (>8000 lux) during callus
induction or growth decreased the percentage of regenerating calluses.<p>

g.  Thermic shock effect. Treatments of 2 to 6 days at 40*degrees*C
applied prior to the transfer on the regeneration medium markedly
increased the efficiency of oganogenesis--121 to 280% in the case of
leaf formation.  In some cases, the cold treatment was able to extend
the period during which callus cultures still regenerated over the six
month limit previously obtained. The percentage of root formation and
the weight of roots per callus were also enhanced.<p>

h.  Age of callus in culture.  Aging of callus was accompanied by a
progressive decline of the morphogenetic reaction. The limit for leaf
formation for seed derived calluses seemed to be six months after
induction, in the given in vitro conditions. Anther-and leaf-derived
calluses showed a less rapid decline of their leaf formation
capacity--13.5% and 9.8% of the calluses respectively were still
regenerating aftr 6 months in culture (Estland, callus induced on
PG1).<p>

It is intereting to emphasize that root formation is less affected
than leaf formation by the in vitro culture conditions.  It still took
place with high frequencies in 21 month old cultures (Columbia).<p>

i.  Chromosomal instability.  A wide range of heteroploidy was
observed with the increased number of subcultures. The origin of the
explant used to induce callus and the hormone concentration (mainly
kinetin) influenced the degree of ploidy in tissue culture (Negruiu,
et al., 1975).  It has been thought that lack of diploid cells in
cultures was the reason for cessation of leaf regeneration, but the
results showed that the rate of leaf regeneration dropped faster than
the percentage of diploid cells in cultures. Furthermore, tetraploid
regenerants have frequently been obtained, an additional indication
that diploidy is not mandatory for regeneration.  It is more likely
that the reason for nondifferentiation lies in the influence of the
exogeneously applied hormones (mainly 2-4D and kinetin) which might
remain in large concentrations and influence the morphogenetic process
as a whole.<p>

2.  Restoration of the in vitro leaf regeneration capacity.  Three
procedures are herein described which can "restore" the regeneration
capacity of 6 month or older seed-derived calluses.<p>

a.  The concentration of sugar in the medium can be increased, for
example, an increase from 2% to 6% in the glucose concentration in the
PG3 medium has made the occurrence of leaf formation possible in 8 to
18 month old calluses.  In the varieties Coimbra and Columbia there
were 4 to 10% leaf regeneration.<p>

b.  A different sequence of media can be used prior to regeneration.
For example, a 14 day transfer on PG5 or PG6 medium was intercalated
between PG2 and PG5 media. The growth on a medium with low kinetin
content and no aluxin (PG5), or without hormones (PG0) allowed
regeneration to occur in 7 to 15 month old calluses in frequencies
ranging from 3 to 17.3% (Estland and Columbia).<p>

c.  Regeneration of old callus cultures is frequently associated with
the formation of abnormal plants.  If the organs of these plants were
induced to form callus, the latter might regenerate normal plants. We
have used two different methods to achieve this:<p>

1.  The abnormal leaves or roots are used to induce "primary" callus,
which is subsequently transferred onto a regeneration medium,
according to the following:<p>

<PRE>
            PG3        roots )
old callus -------&gt;    leaves) --&gt;
            PG0              )
cultures   -------&gt;    roots )<p>

 PG1          PG3
---&gt; callus -----&gt; plantlet formation
</PRE><p>

Thirty to one hundred percent regenerants were obtained from Estland
leaf callus, and 25 to 60% from Estland root callus.<p>

2.  In vitro formed roots and leaves are used to regenerate them
directly into whole plants.<p>

Various hormone concentrations and combinations allowed leaves to
regenerate into rosettes and whole plants.  (Kinetin 10E-6 to 10E-7 M
and IAA 10E-5 to 10E-7 M.)  Kinetin and IAA were used alone or in
combination with 20 mg/l adenosine-sulphate or 125 mg/l yeast extract.
The best results were obtained with 10E-6 M kinetin, with or without
IAA.  IAA concentration was 10-fold less than the respective
concentration of kinetin. The rate of regeneration was increased with
the addition of 20 mg/l adenine sulphate.  However, the best media
plantlet formation never exceeded 30%.  The first method seems to be
best when dealing with abnormal leaves and roots, the second method
with normal leaves and roots.<p>

The efficiency of in vitro regeneration was markedly increased by a
better control of the culture conditions responsible for organ
formation.  A culture system with an optimal hormone balance during
the successive steps of the development of a callus into a plant was
available.  Optimal conditions for light, cold treatment, and interval
between subcultures were established. The progressive decline and
ultimate loss of in vitro morphogenesis with old cultures has been
partly overcome.<p>

The positive effect of the PG2-PG5 or PGO-PG3 sequence on the
restoration of the morphogenetic reaction and the importance of the
duration of the intervals between subcultures, might support the view
that the decline of in vitro morphogenesis is partly due to an
accumulation of the exogenously applied hormones (mainly auxins) with
the increased number of subcultures. This endogenous accumulation
seems to decrease, and finally prevent, the response of the callus
cultures to the inductive regeneration conditions. The relatively low
efficiency of the restoration process suggests that other major
limiting factors than auxin accumulation are responsible for the
decline of regeneration in in vitro conditions.<p>

Considering the present state of knowledge of in vitro morphogenesis,
it is possible by a judicious choice of material and methods to extend
over 18 months the time that cultures are totipotent, permitting,
hopefully, better somatic cell genetics experiments.<p>
