Leaf colour of F1 plants of crosses between different chlorina mutants<p>

The reversion tests which were already reported in the last issue of
this newsletter (ROBBELEN, 1969) were performed with different
chlorina mutants, all of which were characterized by plain
yellow(green) rosette leaves and a more or less normal plant
morphology and growth. During the investigations, crosses were also
made between these original mutants in a diallelic fashion. When the
F1-plants were grown, it turned out that the leaf colour of the
hybrids followed an unexpectedly complex pattern which is tabulated in
the Figure.  Notice for example that the F1 between V300 x V318 is
yellow, indicating allelism between these two mutants; accordingly 252
plants which were raised as F2 generation from this cross, were all of
the mutant type.  On the other hand, the green F1 plants of the cross
between V290 x V300 demonstrate non-allelism.  Other F1 combinations,
however, show intermediate coloring, e.g., in V81 x V89 yellow-green
rosettes.  Still more complicated is the situation if the interactions
of more than two mutant genes are compared; e.g., the two apparently
allelic mutants V300 and V318 clearly differnt in combinations with
chlorina mutants like V93, V157, V290, V295, V308.  In addition it is
interesting to note that 3 mutant allele (V89, V295, V308) are
partially dominating the + allele of the wild type (race Enkheim).
Finally 9 of the tested 11 mutants can be classified into 2 groups,
within which at least one F1 combination is yellow; just so is the
rest of F1's within each group more yellow than the F1 combinations
with members of the other group.<p>

Also the F2 segregation data of this diallel test are so far rather
confusing.  Among the 25 F2's grown up to now, simple monogenic ratios
were only recovered from all the (5) combinations with yellow F1
plants, where the two parent types could be distinguished from one
another.  The whole rest of F2's was more or less distorted. From
green F1 plants, e.g., in the cross V157 x V290 from a total of 1049
individuals 37.9% were alike V290, 16.1% V157, and 45.9% wild type,
giving a significant surplus of mutant phenotypes compared to a
recessive dihybrid pattern.  Especially in F2's from light green to
yellow-green F1 plants 4-6 classes of leaf colours could be clearly
distinguished with various frequencies, of which detailed analyses are
just underway.<p>
