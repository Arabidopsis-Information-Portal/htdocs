TRANSIENT GENE EXPRESSION IN ARABIDOPSIS 
PROTOPLASTS

Wenbin Wei & Keith Lindsey

*  We have used this method of PEG-mediated direct gene transfer into 
Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts for analysing the transient gene expression 
of gusA reporter gene constructs.  The protocol works well for ecotype 
C24.  We have not tried others.

1. PLANT MATERIAL
 *  Use aerial parts of 3-4 week-old seedlings germinated from surface-
sterilised seed and  maintained aseptically on half strength MS10.

2.  SOLUTIONS
  (i) HALF STRENGTH MS10
 Half strength Murashige and Skoog (1962) Medium, e.g., Sigma
 10 gl-1 sucrose
 8 gl-1 Difco agar
 pH 5.8 , adjusted with 0.1M KOH, autoclave

  (ii) ENZYME SOLUTION
(Damm, B. & Willmitzer, L. 1991.  Arabidopsis protoplast transformation and 
regeneration. In: K. Lindsey (ed.) Plant Tissue Culture Manual, A7. Kluwer 
Academic Publishers, Dordrecht. pp1-17.)
 1% (w/v) Cellulase Onozuka R-10
 0.25% (w/v) Macerozyme R-10
 8mM CaCl2.2H20
 0.5M mannitol
 pH 5.5, adjusted with 0.5M KOH, filter sterilise

  (iii) W5 WASH SOLUTION
 154mM NaCl
 125mM CaCl2.2H20
 5mM KCl
 5mM glucose
 0.5M mannitol
 pH 5.8, adjust with 0.1M KOH, autoclave

  (iv)  SUCROSE
 21% (w/v), autoclaved

  (v) MANNITOL/Mg SOLUTION
 15mM MgCl2
 0.1% MES 
 0.4M mannitol
 pH 5.6 , adjust with 0.1M KOH, autoclave

  (vi) PEG SOLUTION
 40% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000 in a solution of:
 0.4M mannitol plus
 0.1M Ca(NO3)2.4H20
 pH 8.0 , adjust with 0.1M KOH
 *  pH takes 2-3 h to stabilise

  (vii) PROTOPLAST CULTURE MEDIUM
 Murashige and Skoog (1962) medium, e.g., from Sigma)
 0.4M glucose
 0.4M mannitol
 1 mgl-1 2,4-D
 0.15 mgl-1 kinetin
 pH 5.8 , adjust with 0.1M KOH

3.  PROTOPLAST ISOLATION
  (i)  Preplasmolyse 1-1.5 g fresh weight of aerial tissues from 3-4 week-
old aerial tissues in  0.5M mannitol in a 9 cm Petri dish for 1 h.  Do this for 
3 or 4 Petri dishes' worth of  material.
  (ii) Remove the mannitol with a Pasteur pipette and add 25-30 ml of 
enzyme solution.
  (iii) Incubate in the dark at 25oC overnight, without shaking.
  (iv)  Filter the digest through 100 mm, and then 50 mm sterile sieves to 
remove undigested  material, and transfer the filtrate to sterile 15 ml 
centrifuge tubes.
  (v) Pellet the protoplasts by centrifugation at 600rpm for 5 min, and 
gently resuspend the  protoplasts in 10 ml W5 wash solution.
  (vi) Repeat step (v).
  (vii) Pellet the protoplasts and resuspend in 2.5 ml mannitol/Mg 
solution.
  (viii) Load 2.5 ml of protoplast suspension onto the surface of a 5 ml 
'cushion' of 21%  sucrose in a centrifuge tube using a Pasteur pipette.
 *  Take care not to disturb the interface between the two layers.

  (ix) Centrifuge at 600rpm for 10 min.
 *  Viable protoplasts will float at the surface of the sucrose, while cell 
debris will be pelleted.
 *  Steps (viii) and (ix) may be unnecessary.  Check the quality of the 
protoplasts after step (vii).

  (x) Count the protoplasts using a haemocytometer and adjust the 
density to 3x106ml-1 in  mannitol/Mg solution.

4.  PEG-MEDIATED TRANSFECTION
  (i) Transfer 106 protoplasts (in 0.3 ml) to a 15ml centrifuge tube.
  (ii) Add 50 mg plasmid DNA plus 100 mg sheared carrier DNA (e.g., 
herring sperm or  salmon sperm DNA).
  (iii) Add 0.3ml PEG solution, mix very gently by rotating the tube, and 
leave for 30 min.  *  We have found that this 30 min period of incubation 
is essential to allow uptake of significant   levels of DNA.

  (iv) Dilute very slowly with 10 ml of W5 over approx. 20 min, a drop at a 
time.
  (v) Pellet the protoplasts by centrifugation at 600rpm for 5 min.
  (vi) Resuspend the protoplasts in 9 ml of protoplast culture medium.
  (vii) Culture 3 ml (3x106) protoplasts in small (5 cm) Petri dishes in the 
dark at 25oC for 48 h.
