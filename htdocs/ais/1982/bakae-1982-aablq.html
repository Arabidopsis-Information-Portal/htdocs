Comparative investigations on the activity of one of the
photosynthetic enzymes, ribosephosphate-isomerase (RPI, C.E. 5.3.1.6)
were carried out on the leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana, race Enkheim,
and its mutant triplex. RPI accelerates the reaction of the
isomerisation of ribosephosphate (R-5-P) into ribulose-5-phosphate
(Ru-5-P), participating in the regeneration of the acceptor CO 2 at
the ribulose-1.5-diphosphate photosynthesis.<p>

The spontaneous mutant has an inceased number of pods - it forms 3 to
5 on one fruitstalk - which defined its name as highly productive or
triplex. The gene analysis states that the mutation involves the fifth
linkage group.<p>

The plants were grown under uniform conditions. The RPI enzyme
preparations from the original race and mutant leaves were isolated
simultaneously. To obtain RPI enzyme preparations 100g of each plant
leaves were taken. All the procedures of enzyme isolation were carried
out in cold at the temperatures of 0-4*degrees*C. The amount of
protein was defined by Lowry method (Lowry et al., 1951) and RPI
activity by modified Axelrod-Yang method (Axelrod and Yang, 1954).
Purification procedures were selected separately for the original race
and its mutant and were thoroughly controlled and analyzed.<p>

Table 1: The purification of RPI from Arabidopsis thaliana, race
Enkheim and its mutant triplex<p>

In this paper the final data on the purification of enzyme RPI
preparations from leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana, race Enkheim and
mutant triplex are presented.<p>

Table 1 shows the procedure and results of RPI purification from the
leaves of the original race Enkheim and mutant triplex. The data
obtained show that the yield of enzyme protein from leaves of Enkheim
is 3% and of triplex 4%. After all the purification procedures the
activity of RPI from the leaves of the original race Enkheim increases
9-times and the enzyme activity from the triplex leaves 11-times. The
comparison with the original form shows that in protein amount and
specific activity triplex is 1.5-2-times higher than Enkheim.<p>

The differences in RPI activity from the leaves of original race
Enkheim and its mutant triplex are most clearly shown at the
estimation of the total fraction activity.<p>

Thus, the data obtained permit us to make a conclusion on the higher
RPI activity in the triplex leaves which may be one of the reasons for
stimulating the productivity of this mutant.<p>
