Postdoctoral Research Associate - Plant Molecular Biology 

R&A IA GBP 20,044 to GBP 30,002 per annum
Available for 3 years 

Ref:  R2727 

A 3-year, BBSRC-funded postdoctoral position is available for a strongly
motivated individual to study novel nuclear mutations that affect the
efficiency of chloroplast protein import in the model plant, Arabidopsis
thaliana. The mutations were identified in forward-genetic screens for
extragenic suppressors of the well-characterized chloroplast protein
import mutants, ppi1 and tic40. Applicants should have a PhD and a
strong background in a relevant discipline. Experience of molecular
biology research will be essential, and experience of research on
Arabidopsis and/or organelle biology will be highly desirable.
