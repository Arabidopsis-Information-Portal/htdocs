Postdoctoral Position ­ Long-distance Signaling in Arabidopsis
 
 
We are looking for a motivated, independent scientist to join our group
investigating the BYPASS1 signaling pathway.  The bps1 mutant roots make a
novel carotenoid cleavage product that is graft transmissible, and that
affects both root and shoot development.  Future work will focus on how the
root-derived signal affects shoot growth (what are the molecular targets)
and the cellular function of BYPASS1 in the roots.

Successful applicants should have a PhD in a relevant area, and have
experience in some of the following areas: molecular biology, genetics, use
of antibodies, generation of transgenic reporters, yeast 2-hybrid, and
microarray analysis, and excellent oral and written communication skills
            
The University of Utah is located at the foot of the Wasatch mountains.
Excellent skiing, hiking, mountain biking is all close at hand, and six
National Parks are within easy striking distance.
