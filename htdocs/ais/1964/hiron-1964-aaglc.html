Vol 01:<h2>HIRONO, Y.</h2><h2>Effect of glucose on chlorophyll content per fresh weight</h2>

The chlorophyll content per fresh weight of the wild-type and two ch
mutants (ch1 and ch2) grown in test tube under natural light increases
with the glucose concentration of the medium. The ratio between
chlorophyll a and b is fairly constant.<p>

The dry matter percentage also increases with the glucose
concentration (the last column of Table).<p>

The chlorophyll content based on dry weight of plant is not much
affected by glucose if it is supplied in concentrations below 2
percent.<p>

The pigment content was measured b the technique of ROBBELEN (1957a).*
This small amount is not considered as real evidence for the presence
of the pigment and it is rather an unavoidable error of this kind of
technique.<p>
