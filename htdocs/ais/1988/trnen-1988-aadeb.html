SUMMARY<p>

The proportion of random mating in a diallel experiment with 5
different recessive mutant lines was found to be dependent not only on
the female and male contribution but also on the female x male
interaction. When random mating is connected with partial or complete
male sterility the proportion of random mating depends (1) on the
level of pollen sterility of the female genotype, and (2) on the level
of ability of the male genotype to release pollen as far as on the
stigmata of the female genotype.<p>

INTRODUCTION<p>

Predominant self-fertilization with 1 to 2% of random mating was
observed in the first experimental studies on mating in A. thaliana
(Lawrence and Snape, 1971; Robbelen, 1971). On the other hand, Redei
(1975) estimated the proportion of random mating in Arabidopsis not
higher than 10E-4.<p>

Since 1975, we have been estimating the proportion of random mating in
A. thaliana by means of the frequency of complementing wild type
heterozygotes appearing in the progeny of different pairs on
non-allelic recessive mutant lines grown together in mixed cultures.
The experimental pattern ensured the posibility to test the reciprocal
differences in mating and, thus, to evaluate the female and the male
contribution of lines to random mating (Cetl and Plchova, 1975; Cetl,
1976; Relichova, 1978).<p>

Very low frequencies of heterozygotes of about 0.2% were observed
except for the combinations where the ln (lanceolata) line acted as
female yielding up to 10% of heterozygotes (Trnena et al., 1987 and
Cetl, 1987). It was obvious the the abnormal behaviour of the ln line
depended on its partial fertility resulting in the insufficiency of
the pollen to bring about full self-fertilisation land offering, in
the neighbourhood of plants of other genotypes, an opportunity of
cross-fertilization. At the same time, the male lines an
(angustifolia) and lc (lucida) were shown to give different
percentages of random mating, 9.17 and 3.88%, respectively when grown
together with the ln line. It was suggested that the frequency of
heterozygotes depended not only on the female and male contribution to
random mating but also on the interaction of the two genotypes.<p>

In the present study, two further recessive mutant lines were included
in order to search for other genotypes yielding high proportion of
random mating when mutually contacted. Some simple morphological and
anatomical characteristics of the reproduction organs of lines were
determined with the aim to suggest the causes of high proportions of
random mating.<p>

MATERIAL AND METHODS<p>

In 1987, the experiments with recessive mutant lines gr (grisea) with
grayish-green leaves and qn (quasinormalis) with abnormal leaf edges
(Cetl, Dobrovolna and Nestra, 1969) were added to those with recessive
mutant lines an, lc and ln studied in 1986 (Trnena et al., l1987). As
the experimental conditions in the two series were strictly identical
their results could be put together. Thus the whole material
represented a 5 x 5 diallel experiment. Unfortunately, the an + gr
combination was omitted due to the lack of viable seeds of the an
line.<p>

The plants in mixed cultures (generation )) and the progeny of every
single line (generation 2) were treated as described in detail by
Trnena et al. (1987). In generation l, more than 700 plants were
classified in each reciprocal comnbination, at an average.<p>

Several morphological and anatomical characteristics of reproduction
organs of the lines were studied:<p>

(1) The growth of the pistil and stamina on sections of flower buds
stained with Mayer's hematoxiline in B 1, B 2, and B 3 stages
according to Muller (1961).<p>

(2) The long and short diameter of pollen grains immediately before
anthesis (B 3).<p>

(3) Viability of mature pollen glrains by means of staining with
acetocarmine and iodine (IIK).<p>

(4) The ability to release pollen grains without violent injury of
mature anthers. Further characteristics concerned the pods in B 7:<p>

(5) The length of unripe pods.<p>

(6) The total number of seed rudiments per pod.<p>

(7) The numbr of vitually formed seeds per pod.<p>

(8) The percentage of successfully formed seeds in the pod.<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

The percentages of heterozygotes were high when the ln line appeared
as female: 9.17% with an, 3.88% with lc, 1.75% with qn but only .13%
with gr as male. In all other combinations, the percentages of
heterozygotes were low, mostly about .2% and only in single cases
about .4 or .8% (Figure 1).<p>

Various comparisons were possible when the percentages were calculated
from the data pooled over certain groups of combinations. The mean
percentage in the combinations with ln as female (2.21%) was 10 times
higher than the similar mean in all other combinations (.21%) see
Figure 1, right. The reciprocal differences in the combinations with
ln were conspicuous: The mean percentage with ln as female (2.21%) was
18 times higher than with ln as male (.12%0. The reciprocal
differences in all other combinations were less pronounced: The mean
percentage in the reciprocal combinations with higher frequencies of
heterozygotes (.39%) was only 2.6 times higher than in the reciprocal
combinations with lower frequencies of heterozygotes).15%).<p>

The female and male contribution of lines to the proportion of random
mating was evaluated (without the incomplete data for the an line) by
means of analysis of variance (Table 1). The mean squares showed that
the effects of lines as females and as males did not appear
statistically significant sources of variation in the proportion of
random mating when tested by means of F (3; 5): F = 3.58 <F .98=5.41,
and F = 2.45 <F .95= 6.51, respectively. The estimates of the
components of variance, 3.72 for females, 1.84 for males, and 5.04 for
the rest, suggested that the largest part of variation fell on the
rest corresponding to the female x male interaction.<p>

Considering the average female contribution of lines to random mating,
the high degree of ability of the partially fertile ln line to produce
heterozygotes was confirmed. In this respect, the gr and qn lines were
similar to the an and lc lines studied by Trnena et al. (1987). At an
average, they did not produce as many heterozygotes as the ln line
even if the qn line showed a certain tendency to higher frequencies of
heterozygotes (.4 to .8%). Nevertheless, the leading position of ln
did not change when the gr and qn lines were included.<p>

The sequence of lines as females according to their average ability to
produce hetrozygotes with other lines was<p>

ln (2.21%) - qn (.38%) - an (.22%) - gr (.19%) - lc (.08%).<p>

Considering the average male contribution of lines to random mating,
the gr lines did not exceed the an line in its high degree of ability
to produce heterozygotes. In this respect, the qn line was similar to
lc showing medium average frequency of heterozygotes while the gr line
resembled ln with its low average frequency of heterozygotes.<p>

The sequence of lines as males according to their average ability to
produce heterozygotes with other lines was<p>

an (2.07%) - lc (.56%) - qn (.54%) - gr (.16%) - ln (.12%).<p>

Multiple differences between the extreme terms of the two sequences
(28 times among lines as females, and 17 times among lines as males,
respectively) testified for strong divergence of the line means. At
the same time, various examples of female x male effects could be
shown in Figure 1. For instance, the ln appearing, at an average,
excellently as female yielded on one hand, double (but only medium)
proportion of random mating with lc as compared with qn though the
averages of the two lines as males were similar. On the other hand,
the ln line as female yielded high frequency of heterozygotes with an
and almost no heterozygotes with gr. Therefore, not only the female
and male contribution by itself but also the female x male interaction
are to be considered as shown in Table 1.<p>

Studying the morphological and anatomical characteristics of
reproduction organs of lines, it was searched, above all, for
peculiarities connected with high female or male contribution to
random mating.<p>

No differences were found among lines in the relative growth rates of
the pistil and the 4 + 2 stamina. Thus the growth synchronisation of
reproduction organs was not disturbed and protandry or protogny could
not take part in supporting random mating neither in the excellent
female, ln, nor in the excellent male, an. The ln line had smallest
pollen grains in B 3 stage (average of diameters 9.88 and 8.83 micro
m). This fact could be connected with their lowered viability but the
reliability interval overlapped that of the an line which appeared the
best male line (average diameters 10.24 and 9.43 micro m). In other
lines the average diameters were larger. No differences among lines
were found also in viability of mature pollen grains when stained with
acetocarmine or iodine. The ability to release free pollen grains
without injuring the mature anthers was very good in all lines except
for the ln line whose pollen got loose in larger quantities only after
mechanical disturbance of anthers.<p>

The ln line had the shortest pods in B 7 stage (7.1 mm) compared with
14.5 mm in an. In gr, lc, and qn the length of pods was about 10 mm.
These differences were due mainly to the peculiar conditions of seed
setting in the ln line. It is true that already the number of seed
rudiments (eggs) per pod was low in this line (23.1) as compared with
other lines (about 30 or more). But the most obvious difference was
that only 10.9 seeds per pod were formed in ln (47.2%) while about 25
or more (86% or more) were set in other lines.<p>

The specific behaviour of the ln line as female consisted really in
its partial pollen sterility. It was rather the consequence of
difficult release of mature pollen from the anthers than of lowered
pollen viability. On the other hand, the an line with its best
performance as male did not show any deviation in the development and
function of the reproductive organs.<p>

It may be concluded that the frequency of spontaneous heterozygotes
among the progeny of different pairs of lines grown together in mixed
cultures appears clearly genotype-dependent. In the cases connected
with partial or complete male sterility of one of the two genotypes,
the proprotion of random mating depends<p>

(1) on the level of pollen sterility of the female genotype leading to
smaller or larger areas on the surface of stigmata not covered by its
own pollen,<p>

(2) on the level of ability of the male genotype to release pollen as
far as on the stigmata of the female genotype. The final effect
follows also from the interaction of the two components.<p>

This presumable mechanism may be applied not only to partially
male-sterile genotypes as the ln line but also to completely
male-sterile ones as, for instance, the ms-1 line (Koornneef et al.,
1983; Kranz and Kirchheim, 1987).<p>

It seems that the condition deciding for random mating in A. thaliana
is the occurrence of areas free from own pollen (1) regardless of the
way of transport of the extraneous pollen (2) either by means of
immediate contact of flowers of the two genotes or by mediation of
insect vectors (Drescher and Kranz, 1987).<p>

Other mechanisms than pollen sterility leading to random mating may be
imagined in A. thaliana and in similar predominantly self-fertilizing
plant species as, for instance, protandry and protogny conditions for
compatibility, and others.<p>
