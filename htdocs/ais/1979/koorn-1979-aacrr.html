INTRODUCTION<p>

Linkage groups have been established in Arabidopsis by Redei (1965)
and McKelvie (1965). A review of most linkage data was given by Kranz
and Scheidemann (1978). Since McKelvie's mutants are not available
anymore, whilst the representative markers of Redei's 6 linkage groups
seem fairly well distributed among Arabidopsis geneticists, and
moreover were located by trisomic analysis (Lee-Chen and
Steinitz-Sears, 1967; Sears and Lee-Chen, 1970), we will continue to
use Redei's linkage group denotation, and in general to take the
Missouri results as a basis of comparison in our studies with the
trisomic set developed at our department.<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

The results presented in a pevious report (Koornneef and Van der Veen,
1978) and the new data obtained since then can be summarized as
follows (Table 1).<p>

1. On the basis of phenotypic resemblance with the description given
in the above mentioned Missouri publications, and by means of Redei's
markers our trisomic T2 was equated to Round (marker py, linkage group
2), and our T3 to Yellow (marker gl, linkage group 3).<p>

2. Feenstra (1978) showed by linkage analysis that an (linkage group
1) and ch (linkage group 4) were on the same chromosome. Our findings
were in accordance as we found an to correspond to telotrisomic T1A
and ch to telotrisomic T1B. These two telotrisomics yielded the same
primary trisomic (T1) which indicated that both trisomics T1A and T1B
have different arms of the same chromosome additional to the diploid
complement. We now have further confirmed this conclusion (Koornneef
and Van der Beek, 1979).<p>

3. In the previous report, Koornneef and Van der Veen (1978) have
tentatively equalized our T4 to the Concave trisomic. This has now
been confirmed by associating vc-2 with T4 (Table 2). So linkage group
6 represents a chromosome which is not occupied by any other linkage
group established by Redei. (We tested the markers an, ch, py, gl, tz,
and lu, by trisomic analysis).<p>

by Fischerova (1975)<p>

In summary our results are in agreement with the Missouri results
(Table 1), with the important exception that linkage group 4 is on
chromosome 1. It should be noted that post-analysis we have denoted
our trisomics by T1 to T5 and the chromosomes of Arabidopsis 1 to 5
(Table 1); in order to obtain the closest possible correspondence with
the numbers of Redei's linkage groups.<p>

Fischerova's (1975) conclusion that lu and vc-2 are on the same
chromosome is clearly at variance with the above mentioned results and
therefore deserves some special attention. She used two lethal
embryonic chlorophyll mutants, viz. M 4-6-18 and ch-42 and obtained
the following recombinant fractions.<p>

From this she indirectly inferred rather close linkage between lu and
vc-2. We have retested these 4 markers by using for the crosses with M
4-6-18 and ch-42 a variant of the method proposed by Relichova et al.
(1973), who suggested to use Moller's (1963) embryo-test in backcross
populations. With this test F2 plants heterozygous for a lethal
chlorophyll gene can be identified by scoring within siliqua
segregation. So linkage can be easily detected in F2 populations
segregating for embryonic chlorophylls.<p>

SUMMARY<p>

Our results can be summarized as follows:<p>

1) By trisomic analysis vc-2 and ch-42 were found on chromosome 4, lu
on chromosome 5, and M 4-6-18 not on chromosome 4 (Table 2).<p>

2) From crosses between the markers (Table 3) it is clear that M
4-6-18 is linked to lu and not vc-2, and that conservely ch-42 is
linked to vc-2 and not to lu. Secondly the direct cross between lu and
vc-2 did not give evidence for close linkage (Table 4). Finally vc-2
is linked to our ga-1 (which we found to be a chromosome 4 marker).<p>

These results show that Fischerova's conclusion is erroneous and that
the Missouri interpretation of the location of linkage group 5 and 6
is correct. We continue with the location of markers of our collection
by means of trisomic analysis and linkage studies.<p>

In Table 1 we have added some of our markers to Redei's standard set.
They were selected on the basis of being distinguishable in different
genetic backgrounds and on their distribution over the chromosomes.<p>
