Vol 01:<h2>ARNOLD, C. G.</h2><h2>Diploid androgenesis</h2>

Androgenetic plants arise by development of a sperm nucleus in the egg
plasm without participation of the egg nucleus.  Androgenesis can
either be produced by crossing different species or by killing the egg
nucleus for instance by X-rays.  As the plasm is more resistant
against X-rays than the nucleus it may be possible to kill the nucleus
leaving the plasm alive.  An untreated sperm nucleus brought into such
an irradiated plasm would have the chance to develop androgenetically.
If the resulting androgenetic plant shows any differences they must be
attributed to the irradiated plasm.  Androgenesis thus could be a
means for producing plasmatic mutants.<p>

Haploid androgenetic plants are, of course, for this project
unsuitable.  It is desirable to produce diploid androgenetic plants,
caused by pollinating with diploid pollen of a tetraploid plant.  To
receive tetraploid plants shoot apices of seedlings were treated with
colchicine solutions in different concentrations from 0, 02 to 0,1%.
The effect was measured by counting the chromocentres in the resting
nuclei of young petals.  Treatment with a 0,08% solution of colchicine
produced the greatest number of chimeras.<p>

To find out the lethal irradiation dose for the egg nucleus
emasculated flowers were X-rayed with different intensities and soon
after irradiation pollinated with haploid pollen.  2, 4, 6, and 8 days
after irradiation the development of the embryos was checked.  At 7000
r only few embryos reach the state of the controls.  The investigation
will be continued raising the irradiation doses until the sperm
nucleus develops by itself.  Then irradiated flowers will be
pollinated with diploid pollen.<p>
