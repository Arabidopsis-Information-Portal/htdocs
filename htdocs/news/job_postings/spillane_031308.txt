PhD Fellowship 
University College Cork, Ireland 
 
Our lab is seeking applications for a PhD fellowship to conduct research 
on genetics of reproduction in Arabidopsis thaliana polyploids. The 
successful applicant will work within a small team of researchers 
investigating sexual and asexual reproduction (apomixis). Applicants 
should have a First or Upper Second Class  Honours Degree or MSc 
in an appropriate discipline. In particular, we seek applicants who 
have previous research experience in Arabidopsis, particularly on topics 
such as genetics, association/QTL mapping, DIC/fluorescence microscopy, 
in situ hybridisation, cytogenetics or chromatin analysis 
in Arabidopsis thaliana.  The PhD Fellowship is funded for three years 
and collaborators include Dr Magnus Nordborg (Uni of Southern California), 
Dr Tom Juenger (Uni of Texas) and Dr Tim Sharbel (IPK Gatersleben). 
The successful applicant will work closely with a postdoc and an additional 
PhD working within the same funded project. Prospective applicants should 
send an e-mail outlining your research interest and motivations, including; 
(a) your C.V. (please list any publications and experimental skills) & 
(b) contact details and e-mail addresses for 3 referees to: 
Dr. Charles Spillane, Genetics & Biotechnology Lab, Biochemistry Dept 
& Biosciences Institute, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.
