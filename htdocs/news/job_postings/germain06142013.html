    Located in Trois-Rivi&#xE8;res, Qc, Canada, the University of
    Trois-Rivi&#xE8;res is a research focused institution that provides
    extraordinary support to its graduate students. The projects hosted in the
    Germain lab (<a href="http://www.germainhugo.com">www.germainhugo.com</a>)
    focuses on pathogen effector biology with an emphasis on Arabidopsis
    immunity and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking.

    The candidate must hold, a Master Degree (or must be finishing a Master
    degree) or equivalent diploma, and must have exceptional academic record.
    The application is a competition for a scholarship of 20-23 000$CA/year
    (similar in USD) for three years to be issued by the FRQNT. Excellence of
    the candidate, both at the academic level and in research as well the fit of
    the candidate with the proposed project based on previous experience and
    interest of the candidate will be decisive factors. The candidates must
    provide a list of their publication in peer reviewed journal. Interested
    candidate can send their CV to <strong><a
        href='mailto:hugo.germain@uqtr.ca'>hugo.germain@uqtr.ca</a>.</strong> no later
    than July 30th, 2013. The candidate selected by the university to
    participate in the competition will be informed of its application status by
    the end of September <strong>(the candidates that have not been

    2014. Candidates having their own funding (full or partial) are also welcome
    to apply.
</p>
<p>The candidate should have a strong background in molecular biology and
    plant biology. Competence and experience in plant-microbe interaction,
    genomics, bioinformatics, cellular biology and Arabidopsis growth and
    genetics are assets. The candidate will be asked to make construct,
    transformation in various microbes, perform infection assay in Arabidopsis,
    make crosses, genotype plants, perform immunoprecipitation, Western blots,
    protein purification, cellular fractionation, HPLC, etc.</p>
