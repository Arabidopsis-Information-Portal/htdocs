     In mammalian and yeast cells many gene products have been identified that
are involved in the formation, budding targeting and fusion of vesicles that
carry proteins to ensure their correct compartmentalization along the secretory
pathway; however, little is known about the secretory machinery in plants.
Members of the syntaxin protein family are thought to act as receptors for
transport vesicles and may contribute to the compartmental specificity of vesicle
fusion. These proteins are anchored to the target membrane by a hydrophobic
region at the extreme C-terminus, with the majority of the protein facing the
cytosol. The talk given by Diane Bassham from Natasha
Raikhel's laboratory (Michigan State University, East Lansing) described the
isolation of an Arabidopsis homologue of syntaxin, PEP12 by functional
complementation of a yeast pep12 mutant. The isolation of the Arabidopsis Pep12
homologue will thus allow to elucidate the role of a Pep12 in protein
trafficking through the plant secretory pathway and provides a tool to study
the mechanism of vesicle trafficking through the secretory pathway. <P>

     Several classes of receptor-like protein kinases have been isolated in
plants. However, the function of these genes is not known except for the
S-locus receptor protein kinase (SRK) gene of Brassica which, together with a
second S-locus gene that encodes a secreted glycoprotein highly related to the
extracellular domain of the receptor, is involved in pollen-stigma signaling in
the self-incompatibility response. To begin to address the role of receptor
protein kinases during plant development, June Nasrallah's laboratory have
focused on three vegetatively expressed Arabidopsis genes, the ARK genes, which
exhibit sequence similarity to the Brassica SRK gene.  Transcriptional and
immunological analyses have indicated that ARK genes encode two gene products,
the full-length receptor and a secreted form of the extracellular domain of the
receptor.  This result suggests that a soluble cell-wall localized receptor is
involved in the mechanism of signaling by this class of receptor kinases in
vegetative cells as in pollen-stigma interactions.  A role for these genes in
developmental processes is suggested by analysis of ARK-overexpressing
transgenic plants which are stunted, sterile, and exhibit drastically reduced
cell size. <P>

      Recent <I>in vitro</I> evidence indicates that the chloroplast homologue of the
54 kd subunit of signal recognition particle (54CP) is required for targeting
LHCP to thylakoid membranes.  To investigate whether 54CP plays a fundamental
role in intrachloroplast protein targeting, the Hoffman laboratory  is using
both antisense and dominant negative approaches in transgenic Arabidopsis.
Plants transformed with either type  of construct contain reduced levels of
54CP protein.  These plants have a "slow to green" phenotype, i.e. the leaves
are initially pale yellow but eventually green to nearly wild type levels.
Targeting efficiency of chloroplast membrane proteins is currently being
examined in the transgenic plants. <P>

Kevin Pyke (University of London, UK) talked about a very interesting
Arabidopsis mutant, ARC6, that is involved in proplastid and chloroplast
division. The arc6 mutant of Arabidopsis was isolated from a T-DNA mutagenised seedling  population by microscope based screening.  Mesophyll cells from leaves of
arc6 plants contain only 1 to 3 chloroplasts  compared to over 80 in wild
type Arabidopsis leaf cells and this low chloroplast number is maintained
throughout mesophyll development and does not increase during cell expansion.
The arc6 mutant shows normal Mendelian inheritance and maps to the bottom of
chromosome 5. Growth and development of arc6 plants are similar to wild type,
with the exception that leaves of arc6 appear twisted and curled which may
result from a slight alteration in mesophyll cell shape.  In compensation for
the severely reduced chloroplast number in arc6 mesophyll cells, the
individual chloroplasts are very large, with up to a 20 fold increase in
average plan area compared to wild type chloroplasts. Consequently the total
amount of chloroplast cover in arc6 and wild type mesophyll cells is similar,
although arc6 chloroplasts show a 50% reduction in chloroplast thickness.
Despite this radical change in chloroplast phenotype, the internal
arrangement of thylakoid membranes is largely unaffected by the mutation,
although the chloroplast envelope shows considerable undulations and
irregularities in outline when viewed in transverse section.  Ultrastructural
analysis of proplastids in cells of the shoot apex and differentiating
chloroplasts in leaf primordial cells show that arc6 has a major effect on
plastid division at the earliest stages of cell development.  Cells of the
shoot apical meristem contain very few, enlarged proplastids exhibiting a
complex three dimensional morphology.  All arc6 apical meristem cells
examined contain proplastids implying that arc6 proplastids must be capable
of limited division to ensure continuity within cell lineages.  <P> 

Analysis of
root proplastids also shows an effect of the mutation similar to that in
shoot proplastids, implying that the arc6 gene plays a role in proplastid
division throughout the plant.  In particular, the specialised starch-filled
plastids in the columella cells, the statoliths, are also greatly increased
in size and are less abundant.  Another significant feature of the arc6
phenotype is an alteration in the distribution of chloroplasts in stomatal
guard cells.  In arc6 stomata, most guard cells contain only a single large
plastid, compared to 4-5 in wild type.  In 30% of stomata, one of the guard
cell pair completely lacks a chloroplast.  Occasionally stomata are observed
in which chloroplasts are absent in both guard cells.  Our characterisation
of the arc6 mutant has indicated that ARC6 is the first gene in higher plants
shown to play a role in the early development and division of proplastids in
mitotic cells. <P>

 Research in Julian Schroeder's lab is focused on the roles of ion
channels in guard cell signal transduction and in plant nutrition (1,2).
Inward rectifying potassium channels allow the inward movement of potassium
into cells.  These ion channels are important in the uptake and movement of
potassium throughout plants and in the control of cell movements, as in
stomatal opening.  At least three potassium channels have now been cloned
from Arabidopsis.  All three have structural features in common with the
Shaker superfamily of potassium channels such as a predicted six membrane
spanning domains and homology in the S4 (voltage sensing domain) and in the
pore region.  KAT1 was clone in Rick Gaber's lab, AKT1 was cloned in Herve
Sentenac's lab, and ATK2 was cloned by Yongwei Cao in Nigel Crawford's and
Julian Schroeder's labs.  AKT2 is expressed in leaves while AKT1 is
expressed in roots as shown in Northern blots.  It is difficult to get a
good Northern blot for KAT1 but work in Mike Sussman's and Rick Gaber's
labs has demonstrated that KAT1 message is expressed in guard cells. <P>

The pore region of potassium channels (H5 domain) contains amino
acid residues which are important for blocker binding.  Audrey Ichida in
Julian Schroeder's lab has made point mutations at these sites to produce
mutant channels with altered blocker sensitivity in an effort to study the
physiological role of these guard cell potassium channels.  Audrey has
identified mutants that, when expressed in Xenopus oocytes, are less
sensitive to block by external cesium and triethanol ammonium (TEA).  These
results provide valuable information concerning the orientation of KAT1 ion
channels in the membrane.  We are hoping that by introducing these blocker
insensitive mutants into Arabidopsis we will have a dominant phenotype to
study the roles of KAT1 channels in stomatal movements. <P>

Yongwei Cao in Nigel Crawford's and Julian Schroeder's labs has
made a series of chimeric ion channels using KAT1 and the Drosophila
potassium channel EAG which is an outward potassium channel (3).  The
chimera containing the N-terminus of KAT1 through the S4 domain and the EAG
pore domain encodes an inward ion channel when expressed in oocytes.  These
data indicate that the orientaion of KAT1 in the membrane is similar to
other Shaker channels (which are outward conducting potassium channels
while KAT1 is inward).  Therefore differences in the gating mechanism
rather than in the overall orientation in the membrane controls the
direction of ion flux through these potassium channels.  The mechanism of
KAT1 channel gating is an important area for future molecular studies. <P>

Stomatal closing occurs due to a decrease in guard cell turgor
caused by a efflux of potassium and anions from guard cells.  Analogous to
the requirement for proton pumping to drive potassium influx into guard
cells during stomatal opening, plasma membrane depolarization is required
to drive potassium efflux during stomatal closing.  Slow anion channels in
the plasma membrane of guard cells are a central controller of stomatal
closing.  The activation of slow anion channels allows anion efflux, a
requirement for stomatal closing, and also depolarizes the plasma membrane
which activates outward potassium channels and drives potassium efflux. <P>

When slow anion channels are blocked by NPPB, a benzoic acid
derivative, or 9-anthacene carboxylate (9-AC), abscisic acid (ABA)-induced
stomatal closing is prevented.  These blockers also prevent the inhibition
of stomatal opening by ABA.  Work in our lab is focused on the
physiological regulation of slow anion channels during ABA-induced stomatal
closing.  Early work by Julian Schroeder demonstrated that increases in
cytoplasmic calcium activates slow anion channels and indicated that this
regulation was indirect. <P>

In patch clamp experiments Christian Schmidt in Julian Schroeder's
lab found that cytoplasmic ATP was required to maintain slow anion channel
activity and that ATP could not be replaced by non-hydrolyzable analogs
(4).  These data suggested that protein phosphorylation was involved in the
regulation of slow anion channel activity.  In further experiments
Christian Schmidt found that K252A, a kinase inhibitor, inhibited slow
anion channel activity at the whole cell and single channel level.
Consistent with these results, okadeic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor, was
found to maintain slow anion channel activity in the absence of cytoplasmic
ATP.  These results indicate that ABA either inhibits a protein phosphatase
or activates a protein kinase and that slow anion channel (or associated
regulatory protein) phosphorylation is required for activation of slow
anion channels. <P>

This hypothesis is supported by experiments in which the effects of
kinase and phosphatase inhibitors was tested on ABA-induced stomatal
closing conducted by Yuh-jen Liao and John Esser in Julian Schroeder's lab.
 K252A completely blocked ABA-induced stomatal closing while okadeic acid
enhanced ABA-induced stomatal closing.  The regulatory effects of ABA on
slow anion channel activity in guard cells are currently under
investigation in our lab and should further reveal the mechanism of ABA
signal transduction. <P>
