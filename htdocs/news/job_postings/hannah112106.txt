A post-doctoral fellowship is available for up to three years to
investigate the molecular mechanisms of cold acclimation in Arabidopsis.
Initially, the candidate should complete two well-established projects
that continue our recent studies (see Hannah et al., 2005, PLoS Genet.
1, e26, http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.0010026; Hannah et al.,
2006, Plant Physiol. 142, http://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.106.081141). The
first uses real-time PCR and expression profiling to investigate
interactions between cold and other signalling pathways. The second
project investigates the role of novel proteins in determining freezing
tolerance. These high-interest candidates were selected from our earlier
profiling studies and homozygous KO mutants are already available. These
are being screened for differences in freezing tolerance using
established protocols, and for molecular phenotypes using transcript and
metabolite profiling.

The candidate will have access to the extensive institute facilities and
resources, which provide the ideal environment for research, cooperation
and learning (http://www.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/). The position will also
allow the freedom for the candidate to develop new projects within the
bounds of understanding the regulation and development of plant stress
tolerance at the system level.

The candidate should have a sound background in plant molecular biology
and the ability to pursue an independent project in an international
research environment. Experience in stress physiology would be an
advantage.
