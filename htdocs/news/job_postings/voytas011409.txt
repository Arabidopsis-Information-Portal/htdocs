 
Advertisement for a Postdoctoral Position 
 
A postdoctoral position is available in the laboratory of Dr. Dan Voytas at the University 
of Minnesota to work on a new and powerful platform for making targeted sequence 
modifications in plant genes.  The platform uses zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) – enzymes 
engineered to create DNA double strand breaks in specific target loci.  Cleavage of target 
genes by ZFNs introduces mutations at the cut site by imprecise repair through non-
homologous end-joining (Mol Cell 31:294).  In the presence of a homologous DNA 
template, specific modifications can be introduced into target genes by homologous 
recombination (Plant J 44:693).  The candidate will implement gene targeting in a crop 
plant with the goal of conferring traits of agronomic value.  The position involves 
considerable interactions with industry and entails travel to Europe to work with 
collaborators.  The incumbent should posses a PhD in molecular biology, genetics or 
plant biology.  Experience working with plants is considered essential, and expertise in 
plant metabolism and physiology is desired.  The position will remain open until filled 
and will last for three years. Interested applicants should send a CV and the names and 
contact information of three persons who can provide a letter of reference.  Please send 
information by email to chra0004@umn.edu.
