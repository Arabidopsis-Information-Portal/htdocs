To elucidate the question whether phytochrome participates in the
photoperiodic reaction of Arabidopsis, plants were irradiated with
far-red light (FR) for 15 min at the beginning of the darkness at
different photoperiods.<p>

For the experiments the race Estland 2075/4 was chosen for its early
growth and small dimensions. The plants grew in sterile flasks on agar
medium with the half concentration of a Knop solution prepared
according to VELEMINSKY and GICHNER (1964).  Luminescent tubes LB-40
giving 20 wt/m2 at the level of the plant rosettes were used as a
light source. The duration of the diurnal illumination varied from 4
to 24 hours with two hour intervals.  FR was obtained from reflecting
incandescent lamps (300 wt) by filters consisting of 2 cm water, a
dark-blue glass filter as well as 3 red and 1 dark-blue cellofan film.
The maximum of radiation corresponded to 730 nm; the intensity of the
radiation at the rosette level was 17 wt/m2.<p>

The figure shows the typical quantitative dependence of flowering on
the duration of the diurnal illumination, with a local maximum at
10-12 hours day length (curve I).  FR given immediately at the
beginning of the dark period markedly accelerated the development of
the plants (curve II).  This acceleration was faster with the shorter
days than with the longer ones.  FREDERIQ and DeGREEF (1966) observed
similar effects in Marchantia, where the active form of phytochrome
(Pfr) controlled the orthotropic growth of the thallus.<p>

As FR extracts Pfr out of the system, it is reasonable to assume that
the absence of Pfr hinders the reproduction, and the lowering of its
level below a certain limit promotes it.  At the other hand in the
experiments without FR radiation the bud formation of the plants is
faster with the longer days or with the continuous illumination (CI),
whereas the amount of Pfr is sufficient during the whole cycle. To
overcome this contradition, one may suppose that during the day the
level or the activity of Pfr is low; but on tuning the light out this
level of activity increases and remains high during the greater part
of the night.  In this case it should be expected that a short day is
at least not less favourable for the development than C.I.  However,
this is not true. This non-coincidence of the observed dates with the
expected ones may partly be explained by the delay of the
morphological manifestation rate of the reaction.  In fact, in other
experiments the addition to the medium of 3% sucrose considerably
accelerated the bud formation and under these conditions plants
irradiated by FR after turning out the light formed buds under a
4-hour daily illumination at the same day as those under C.I.<p>
