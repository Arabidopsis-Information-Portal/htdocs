A number of more recent investigations of variation in natural
progenies of Arabidopsis have cast some doubt on the long-held belief
that the species is strictly autogamous (NAPP-ZINN, 1964; DOBROVOLNA,
1966; JONES, 1968, 1971; KARBE and ROBBELEN, 1968).  Since all of
these investigations concern metrical characters, however, none
provide an unambiguous test for the presence of heterozygotes in
open-pollinated progenies.  The present experiment was designed to
provide such a test.<p>

Each of 10 plants of the Wilna-2 inbred line was closely (6 cms) and
completely surrounded by a ring of 6 plants of the LANGRIDGE line,
making ten groups of seven plants in all.  Five of these groups were
placed outdoors in an open situation (block 1) and the remainder in a
more sheltered place between a pair of glass houses (block 2), the
groups in both blocks being not less than 2 m apart.  The Wilna-2 line
breeds true for the recessive trait, glabrous leaves, while plants of
the LANGIDGE line exhibit the dominant, wild-type character, hairy
leaves.  The plants of both lines came into flower in the open at
approximately the same time and were allowed to continue with the
minimum of attendance until they died naturally.  Plants of the
LANGRIDGE line were then removed carefully and ripe siliquae were
harvested from the Wilna-2 plants over a three-week period on up to
four separate occasions at the end of the experiment..  At this time,
white flowering stems of both lines had grown into one another, the
plants being approximately 30 cm tall.<p>

The seed so obtained was sown individually in boxes of soil in the
glasshouse, 400 seeds being sown, where supplies allowed, from each
harvesting occasion - plant combination.  Germination was good with a
rate of 96.4% and a total of 10,395 seedlings were scored three weeks
after the seed was sown.<p>

Now if each of the ten Wilna-2 plants under test had set seed
autogamously, none of their progeny, mutation apart, would be expected
to bear hairy leaves.  In fact, a total of 180 seedlings did so, a
proportion which yields an overall estimate of the frequency of
outcrossing in these plants of 1.73 +/- 0.12%.  There were,
furthermore, significant differences between both plants and blocks
with respect to their frequency of outcrossing, as the following table
makes clear:<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol08/vol08-pg6-tab1.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

Thus the average frequency of outcrossing in the first block,
occupying the more open situation, is 2.15%, while that in the
relatively more sheltered second block is only 1.19%.  There are also
significant differences between harvesting occasions within plants.
In block 2, the frequency of outcrossing is highest among the progeny
of the first harvest.  In block 1, on the other hand, though the
progenies are heterogeneous in this respect, no consistent trend
emerges.<p>

There can be no doubt from these results that outcrossing can occur in
this species; its cause, however, is much less clear.  The test was
carried out under a high plant density in the belief that contact
between adjacent influorescences caused by wind movement might be the
causal mechanism of cross-pollination, a belief which receives some
support from these results in that the frequency of outcrossing is
higher in block 1 than in the more sheltered block 2.  On the other
hand the frequency of outcrossing on this view, is expected to
increase with age in that later flowers on well-developed side shoots
can more easily make contact than those on the main one. The results
from the second block, however, suggest that the frequency of
outcrossing is highest for these early flowers. Cross-pollination by
contact therefore appears to be ruled out.  Though visits by insects
to flowers of this species are not common in the urban environment in
which this experiment was performed, hover flies (family Syrphidae)
have been observed occasionally to visit plants in the glasshouse.
Indeed, casual, infrequent visits by insects of this type would be
expected to cause the rather erratic frequency of outcrossing may well
be lower than that which is obtained in natural populations of the
species.<p>

We should welcome further information concerning both the frequency of
outcrossing in the species, as well as the causal agent of its
cross-pollination.<p>
