The gene loci of two homoallelic mutants (ch1, ch2,) and of a third
mutant (ch3) have primary effects on the biosynthesis of chlorophyll b
(Cb) and secondary effects on the production of other chloroplast
pigments (KRANZ, 1971).  In agreement with preceding results the
mutant ch3 is found to be based on the recessive alleles of a second
ch gene, which behaves complementary to the alleles ch1 and ch2 of the
first gene, i.e., the double heterozygote +ch3/ch1+ resembles the green
phenotype of the wildtype, and the double recessive genotype ch1ch3/ch1ch3 is
lethal, whereas the two single recessives resemble the light green and
yellow phenotypes of the parental mutants ch1 and ch3.  Further
information on the extent and time of gene action in the process of
the chlorophyll formation will be obtained by refining the analytic
methods for the detection of the pigment precursors.<p>

Figure 1: Difference (delta E) (above) and derivative spectra (delta
E', and delta E'') (below) of the double heterozygous genotype +ch3/ch1+
minus the parental mutant ch1+/ch1+ absorption<p>

This analysis emphasizes the differences (delta E) in the absorption
spectra of the leaf pigments of the different genotypes and not the
absolute values of the extinction (E).  The derivation of (delta E) is
very effective in demonstrating small differences (SHIBATA, 1957;
MEISTER, 1966).  For that reason the extinction of the extracts
(acetone 80 p.c.) of plants with one flower was measured with a Zeiss
PMQ II spectrometer; the data were stored by punched tape, the
difference was corrected for chlorophyll a (Ca) and its first and
second derivative (delta E' and delta E'') was calculated by computer
processing.  In Figure 1 an example is given; its upper part shows the
difference spectrum calculated from the extinction of the green
heterozygote +ch3/ch1+ minus that extinction of the homozygous mutant
ch1+/ch1+ without Cb.  The lower graphs show the spectra of the first
and second derivation.  delta E = 0 signifies equal absorption of the
same pigment at the wavelength concerned.  delta E' = 0 and delta
E'' approching minimum means pigments in excess in the green heterozygote.<p>

The results so far obtained by this method are summarized as follows:
1) Besides the end products of the chlorophyll biosynthesis, Ca664 and
Cb647 five pigments can be observed at certain wavelengths.  2) In the
green genotypes resembling the wildtype the content of the pigment for
lambda(delta E max = 631 nm) (P631) exceeds that of the mutants ch1
and ch3.  3) When the difference spectrum is calculated from the
absorptions of the heterozygotes minus the ch1, no excess in the
pigment P636 can be observed.  4) Substracting the absorption of the
ch3 from the heterozygotes the derivative spectra show more P636 in
the heterozygotes than in the mutant.  5) Probably there are
differences in the pigment C669 between the double heterozygotes from
reciprocal crosses.  6) The double heterozygotes contain more pigment
C684 than the mutants.<p>

The results from this analysis show that the synthesis of P631 rsp.
P636 is probably blocked to a certain extent by the mutant genes
concerned.  Complementary interactions between the first and the
second ch gene on the other pigments can be observed.  Further
experiments will be necessary to confirm that the five pigments are
transformation products in the biosynthesis of Ca664 and Cb647.
Hereby more precise information about the primary action of the
different genes on the reactions during the chlorophyll formation can
be expected.<p>
