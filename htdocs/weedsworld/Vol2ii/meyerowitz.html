Weigel spoke about the functions of the meristem identity 
genes LEAFY and
UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS in establishment of floral meristem 
identity, and in
induction of the B function organ identity genes AETALA3 
and PISTILLATA. 
Ectopic expression of LFY gives ectopic flowers (in 
the positions where
shoots would be), and the flowers are of normal structure. 
 35S-LFY also
causes early flowering in Arabidopsis (as measured by 
rosette leaf number),
but in short days only.  Remarkably, expression of LFY 
from a 35S promoter in
Poplar, which normally flowers in five years, allows 
flowering in six months
in noninductive long day conditions.  Ectopic expression 
of UFO does not give
ectopic flowers, and gives an abnormal flower phenotype 
in which sepals
become petalloid and carpels, staminoid.  This mimics 
the phenotype of
uniform expression of B function genes, showing that 
UFO is sufficient to
activate the B function organ identity genes.<P>

Irish described experiments on the nuclear localization 
of the B function
organ identity gene products, the AP3 and PI proteins. 
 AP3-GUS fusion
proteins, when ballistically introduced to onion cells 
attached to the 35S
promoter, show GUS staining in cytoplasm.  PI-GUS fusions 
act similarly. 
Delivering both genes to the same cells allows nuclear 
staining.  The
interpretation given is that an AP3-PI heterodimer localizes 
to the nucleus,
while each protein alone does not.  If true, this would 
represent a new
mechanism of nuclear localization in plants and an additional 
level of
control of the B function genes.<P>

Beth Savidge described the expression of the CAULIFLOWER 
and APETALA1 genes,
and the consequences of mutations in them.  One consequence 
is that, in an
ap1 cal double mutant, AG is not activated.  In either 
single mutant it is. 
This indicates a redundancy in the function of AP1 and 
CAL for the induction
of AG.  35S-CAL and 35S-AP1 plants have an apical terminal 
flower, mimicking
the tfl mutant phenotype, and showing that either gene 
alone is sufficient
for converting an inflorescence meristem to a floral 
meristem.<P>

Milo Aukerman summarized the complex interactions of 
the late and early
flowering genes, and described the molecular cloning 
of the LUMINIDEPENDENS
late flowering gene.  It codes for a novel protein, 
and when fused to GUS,
the GUS activity is nuclear.  The LD promoter fused 
to GUS shows that the
gene is active in young but not old leaves, and is always 
on at the shoot
apex.  Epitope tagging of the protein allowed quantitation, 
and showed that
is on at higher levels in floral apices that in seedling 
apices.<P>

Guillermo Cardon described work in snapdragon that led 
to the cloning of two
zinc finger proteins that bind upstream of the SQUAMOSA 
gene, the snapdragon
orthologue of APETALA1.  Six similar Arabidopsis genes 
have been cloned, at
least three of these bind to the AP1 promoter.  One 
of these, SPL3, is
developmentally regulated and comes on before AP1 as 
assayed by RNA blots. 
The other two (SPL1 and 2) are constitutively active. 
 35S-SPL3 plants are
early flowering, and also can have bracts under the 
first flower.  It seems
plausible then that SPL3 is a genuine upstream regulator 
of AP1.<P>

Steven Clark described the CLAVATA genes CLV1 and 3, 
showing that they act to
suppress excess cell division in shoot and floral meristems. 
 Genetic
interactions between clv1 and clv3 indicate that they 
act in the same process
(e.g. clv1/+ clv3/+ plants show a clv mutant phenotype; 
clv1/clv1 clv3/clv3
double mutants look no different than either single 
mutant).  clv mutations
act to partially suppress SHOOT MERISTEMLESS mutations, 
indicating that one
function of the CLV loci is to act opposite to STM, 
such that CLV represses
meristem cell proliferation (or enhances cell differentiation) 
and STM
promotes cellular proliferation (or acts against differentiation). 
 The
molecular cloning of the first of CLV loci, CLV1, was 
described; it appears
to be a transmembrane receptor ser/thr kinase.<P>
