Description:
A postdoctoral position will be available February 2008 in the laboratory of Dr. 
Olga 
Zabotina, Department of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Molecular Biology at Iowa 
State 
University.  Research will focus on the biosynthesis and metabolism of 
hemicelluloses in 
plants using biochemistry, genetics and reverse-genetics approaches.  Research 
will also 
focus on functional characterization of enzymes involved in these processes.  
These 
efforts will be directed towards the fundamental understanding of cell wall 
formation and 
development in plants and involvement of its components into stress response and 
adaptation as well as search of the ways of plant modification for biofuel 
production. 

Applicant must have Ph.D and a strong background in plant biochemistry and 
molecular 
biology. Experience in the various molecular biological techniques (standard 
recombinant 
DNA techniques, mapping, microarray, etc) is desirable. The initial appointment 
is for 
one year and the term will be extended for up to three years contingent upon 
funding and 
satisfactory performance. Salary is commensurate with experience. Health and 
retirement 
benefits are provided with the position. Iowa State University is an equal 
opportunity/affirmative action employer and encourages applications from 
underrepresented groups. Review of applications will continue until a suitable 
candidate 
has been identified.
