A postdoctoral position is available starting immediately in the lab of Christian Hardtke 
at the Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Lausanne, Switzerland. Our 
department offers excellent research infrastructure combined with a lively, interactive 
and international scientific community, located in the beautiful Lake Geneva region.

The candidate for this SNF-funded position is expected to build on recent progress in our 
lab to investigate the role of BRX family proteins in various aspects of growth and 
development in Arabidopsis and other species, with an emphasis on the transcriptional 
and post-translational hormonal control of BRX and its interaction partners (building on 
Mouchel et al, Genes & Development, 2004; Mouchel et al., Nature, 2006; & recent 
progress).

More details about the project are available upon request.

Strongly motivated candidates with demonstrated expertise in molecular techniques are 
encouraged to apply.

Please forward applications including a curriculum vitae and contact information for two 
senior scientist referees by e-mail to christian.hardtke@unil.ch.
