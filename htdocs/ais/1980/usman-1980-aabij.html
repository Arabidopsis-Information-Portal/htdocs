Constantly increasing income to the atmosphere of such anthropogenic
contaminations as oxides of nitrogen and sulphur, chlorine and
fluororganic combinations which actively destroy ozone layer can lead
to the continuous increase of intensity of UV-irradiation that reaches
the Earth's surface. Possible ecological and microevolutional
consequences of such increase of intensity of UV-rays for populations
of living organisms, for populations of higher plants in particular,
are of great interest.<p>

Influence of UV-rays on fitness of plants of Arabidopsis as well as
the dependency of this quantity on plant genotype was investigated.
Under the fitness we mean here the quantity that equals average number
of progenies per sown seed (Fisher, 1930). The experiment was carried
out at the station of Rui-Dasht (2200 m above the sea level). The
plants were grown at the following intensities of UV-rays:<p>

a) open area; b) the area under the usual polyethilene foil allowing
75% of UV-rays of range "A" (380-320 nm) and 67% of UV-rays of range
"B" (320-285 nm); c) the area under the stabilized foil allowing 23%
of UV-rays of range "A" and 7% of UV-rays of range "B".<p>

Table 2: Influence of UV-rays on the survival of heterozygotes for xa.<p>

In each area of the boxes with soil plants of seven different genetic
lines were grown: En (original race Enkheim), 122 xa, 127 xa, P 10/53
(lines, hetrozygous for lethal chlorophyll mutation of xa type),
*gamma*-40 (spotted rosette leaves), 2/19 (dwarf) and 315 (brittleness
of pods). On each area 200 seeds of each line were sown.<p>

It is seen from Table 1, that when the intensity of UV-rays increases
the fitness of all lines decreases. It occurs mainly owing to the
increase of mortality of plants at early stages of ontogenesis (death
of plants after formation of 4 regular leaves was not practically
observed) and after delaying of development. But decrease of fitness
for variant lines is different. For lines En, P 10/53 and 127 xa it is
too small to be significant, for lines 315 fitness of plants is
5-times less, and for *gamma*-40, 2/19 and 122 xa it is 1.5-2 times
less (Table 1).<p>

Under the influence of UV-rays fitness of heterozygotes for xa is also
changed. Under the lab conditions of the artificial light in the
progeny of heterozygous plants segregation 2:1 occurs, that is, the
survival of homozygotes of wild type and of heterozygotes for xa is
the same. But, under the Alpine UV-rays the survival of heterozygotes
is 1.5-3 times less than that of the homozygotes fo the wild type
(Table 2).<p>

That means that UV-irradiation is an effective factor of
microevolution which determines significant differences in fitness of
plants with different genotypes. It is interesting to note, that of 7
eventually selected lines line En, the original race, appeared to be
the least sensitive to the UV-rays. Therefore, it is possible to
suggest that UV-rays are the factor of stabilizing selection which
destroys at the first place individuals with pigment mutations which
effects even in the heterozygous condition. The fact of absence of
chlorophyll mutations in Alpine populations of Arabidopsis can serve
as an indirect confirmation of this suggestion (Usmanov et al., 1978).
Therefore, it is possible to conclude that the increase of intensity
of natural UV-rays can change both the rate and direction of
microevolutional processes in populations of plants, and the decrease
of genetic variability seems to be the most possible and results in
the decrease of adaptive potential of populations.<p>
