A postdoctoral position is available to study the biophysics of cellulose 
synthesis. The project aims to apply high resolution and single-molecule 
sensitive imaging techniques to characterize the motility of the cellulose 
synthase. As material we will use intact plants (established lines and new 
ones to be developed) and we are particularly interested in using in vitro 
preparations to achieve greater opportunities for experimental 
manipulation. The position requires a Ph.D. in a relevant area of biology 
or biophysics and preference will be given to candidates having experience 
with purifying active protein complexes. The position is supported by an 
NSF grant to Lori Goldner (Physics) and Tobias Baskin (Biology). The 
Goldner lab uses single-molecule-sensitive physical and optical tools to 
study the dynamics and interactions of biomolecules and bio-molecular 
complexes. The Baskin lab studies the role of cellulose in growth. The 
University of Massachusetts is an Equal Opportunity Employer and we 
encourage all qualified persons to apply. To apply, please send your cv to
