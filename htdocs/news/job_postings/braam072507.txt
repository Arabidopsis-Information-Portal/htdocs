POSTDOCTORAL POSITION:
PLANT ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSES:  CELL WALL MODIFICATION AND CALCIUM SIGNAL 
TRANSDUCTION

Laboratory of Janet Braam
Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology
Rice University

A postdoctoral position is available to participate in research focused on 
determining the mechanisms by which plants sense environmental stresses, 
interpret calcium signals, and regulate cellular and organismal responses.  
Integrative approaches to elucidate the physiological and cellular functions of 
the xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase (XTH) and the calmodulin-like gene 
families of Arabidopsis are underway.  See: 
http://www.bioc.rice.edu/~braam/projects/index.html for more information.

A strong background in plant biology, molecular biology, biochemistry and 
genetics is desired.  Only highly motivated individuals with proven track 
records should apply.  Applicants should send a curriculum vitae, a cover letter 
describing research experience and interests, and the names and email addresses 
for at least three references to:  braam@rice.edu.
