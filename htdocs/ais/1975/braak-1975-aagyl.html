The nitrate reductase-less mutant B25 (OOSTINDIER-BRAAKSMA and W.J.
FEENSTRA, 1974) grows very poorly on nitrate as the only N-source.
Selection for revertants can therefore be carried out simply by
looking for well growing plants on a nitrate medium. After EMS
treatment about 30,000 M1 plants were screened, but no revertants were
found.  Among M2's of 1000 M1 plants 7 independently arisen revertants
could be isolated (isolation numbers B25R1, B25R2 etc).  Some data
about the first 4 revertants will be given here.<p>

All revertants grow well on media with nitrate as the sole N-source,
and are chlorate sensitive like the wildtype.  All revertants regained
the ability to synthesize nitrate reductase, though on ammonium
nitrate medium B25R1 exhibits a low level of Nitrate reductase
activity, about equal to the level on ammonium medium.  F1's of
revertant x B25 showed chlorate resistance (B25 phenotype) and all
except the F1 of B25R1 x B25 showed poor growth on a nitrate medium
(also B25 phenotype).  Thus for B25R1 dominance relationship depends
on the criterium used, whereas for the other revertants the
restoration of nitrate reductase activity is recessive.  Results from
F2-analysis of the cross revertant x wildtype suggest for all
revertants a mutation in a gene segregating independently of B25.
Results of Km studies of nitrate reductase from wildtype and
revertants do not suggest that the properties of the enzyme are
different.<p>
