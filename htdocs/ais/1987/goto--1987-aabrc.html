A single gene recessive mutant called the pin formed or 24-a of
Arabidopsis thaliana is unable to develop flower organs. This mutant
has been induced and selected by H. Kappert (1959), and was firstly
demonstrated by A.R. Kranz during the 2nd International Symposium on
Arabidopsis Research, 1976, held at Frankfurt/Main.<p>

The pin-formed mutant usually develops secondary shoots lacking any
flower organ (Figure 1). Most of the shoots terminate with reduced
flower organs, i.e., no petals and/or stamens, and the stems are
usually fasciated. The mutant plants are not reproductive and can only
be obtained from the heterozygous +/pin genotype whose phenotype is
identical with the wildtype.<p>

Since gibberellins applied to the vegetative rosette promote flowering
of Arabidopsis, however, there are some reports that gibberellin does
not necessarily promote the flowering process although it enhances the
bolting of the long day plants (see Bernier et al., 1981). Therefore,
investigating the defective function of the pin gene we may expect
that the role of gibberellin is normal in the mutant and treatment
with GA-substances will not normalize the flower development. Thus,
the process of flower induction is separate from the hormonal control
of bolting also in Arabidopsis. On the other hand, since short-stemmed
GA-defective mutants of Arabidopsis can be normalized to wildtype
phenotype by treating with GA (Koornneef, 1980), uncontrolled
overproduction of native gibberellins can be alternatively assumed for
the pin-mutant.<p>

Kappert (1959). Shoots terminate like threads without flower organs,
or with elongated pistils and sometimes with deformed petals, but
never with anthers.<p>

We have expected the pin-formed mutant is useful to examine the role
of gibberellin in the flower development separately from bolting
process. Present study aimed to ascertain whether gibberellins are
efficient on the development of flower organs using this mutant.<p>

Seeds were obtained from AIS-seed bank (access. no. 2064), selected
from mutant F97. The mutant can only be maintained from wildtype
phenotypes segregating the mutant type in a Mendelian ratio of 3:1
which shows the parent plants to be heterozygous (+/pin). This sample
was harvested from wildtype pheonotypes in F3, thus resembling a
mixture of homozygous +/+ and heterozygous +/pin genotypes. The seeds
were sown on the soil in pots, and allowed to grow in a green house
(20*degrees*C, 16h light/8h dark cycle) after 4 days cold treatment
(2*degrees*C, darkness). Gibberellins (GA 4+7 and GA 3) were applied
to the leaves (50 micro l/day/plant) from the 4th day after
transferring to the greenhouse. Treatment with GA 10E-2 M was
interrupted for one week to avoid damage of plants developing
rosettes.<p>

Table 1 shows the frequency of the pin-formed plants, which in the
absence of any selection is expected to appear in 10% of F 4
generation. With ts-test we concluded that the frequency in appearance
of the pin-formed plants was not affected by gibberellins, i.e.,
gibberellin cannot change the phenotype of the pin-formed mutant.<p>

II. Shoot apex with deformed ovary.<p>

III. Shoot apex with deformed pistil composed of sterile ovary and
stigma.<p>

IV. III plus deformed petals.<p>

V. III plus deformed stamens composed of filament and aborted anthers
lacking pollen grains.<p>

VI. V plus deformed petals.<p>

The stem apex of the pin-formed plant usually becomes sharp like a pin
tip. However, some plants develop deformed sterile flower organs at
the top of the stem, which are able to be classified into several
stages according to their morphological imperfection (Fugure 2). Table
2 shows the effect of gibberellins on coming to perfection of flower
morphology which was set on the basis of the indiction in Figure 2.
High concentration (10E-2M) of both the gibberellins seemed to
decrease the frequency of the plants completely lacking flower organs.
This suggests that giberellins may promote the process of flower
organization. However, it is necessary to confirm this suggestion by
examinations using greater number of the pinformed plants.<p>

pin-formed plants.<p>

Table 3 shows the number of rosette leaves developed by the time of
bolting. Gibberellins reduced the number of leaves (i.e., hastened the
bolting) in both the normal land pin-formed plants, the effect being
greater in GA 10 4+7 than GA 3. This may indicate that gibberellins
act to promote the process of shoot elongation of the pin-formed
plants in the same manner as of the normal plants.<p>

the pin formed plants<p>

Conclusion of the preliminary results obtained confirms the
independence of the flower development from the gibberellin control of
bolting and that native GA is not overproduced in the pin mutant of
Arabidopsis. Evidently, defective function of the pin gene is already
expressed at the level of flower induction which has to be confirmed
by further investigations.<p>
