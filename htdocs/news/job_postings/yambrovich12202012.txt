The Plant Genome Research Program (PGRP) at the Boyce Thompson Institute at 
Cornell University offers paid, 10-week summer internships for students 
interested in a research career in plant sciences to protect the 
environment, enhance human health, and improve agriculture. This is a 
great opportunity to gain research experience in the following areas of 
plant science research: 



 - Bioenergy and Bioproducts 

- Cell and Developmental Biology 

- Disease and Resistance 

- Genomics and Systems Biology 

- Molecular Biology 

- Plant-Insect Interactions 

- Biochemistry 

- Epigenetics 

- Plant-Fungi Symbiosis 

- Breeding for Crop Improvement 

- Environmental and Stress Response 

- Science Education 

- Bioinformatics and Computer Science 



By participating in PGRP summer internships, students gain a broader 
knowledge of plant genetics and take away a better understanding of genuine 
scientific research. Students in the internship program will have the 
opportunity to: 

- Work closely with graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and 
scientists on a supervised independent project within the framework of the 
mentor's research program 

- Attend weekly plant science seminar with scientists from BTI, 
Cornell and the USDA 

- Present their research to the other students, scientists, and 
mentors at our PGRP Student Symposium 

- Attend lab meetings, read and discuss recent literature related 
to their project 

- Participate in fieldwork, depending on the lab
