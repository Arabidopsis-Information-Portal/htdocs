Genome-wide mapping of recombination in Arabidopsis thaliana 

We are using high throughput sequencing to determine the segregation of 
genetic markers as a means to map genome-wide meiotic recombination 
frequencies in the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. The research associate 
will work jointly with Dr Ian Henderson and the Department Bioinformatics 
Group of 6 researchers led by Dr Krys Kelly. The associate will perform 
computational analysis of high throughout sequencing data to generate 
crossover frequency maps, which will be correlated with other genomic and 
epigenomic datasets. This work has important implications for population 
genetics and crop improvement. 

Applicants should have a PhD and substantial experience of a computer 
language (e.g. R, Perl). Experience in statistics, statistical genetics, 
quantitative genetics or genomics would also be beneficial.
