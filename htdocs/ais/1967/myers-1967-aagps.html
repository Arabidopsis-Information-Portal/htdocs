	The seed output of Arabidopsis thaliana race "Estland" was scored from populations grown in a factorial experiment with four plant densities and three mineral nutrient levels.  The experiment had a six-fold replication.<p>

	The populations were raised on "acid-washed" sand (99% 2-0.2mm) in polyethylene pots 5 cm high and 6 cm internal diameter at the top.  Seeds were sown on the surface of the sand with regular spacings at the following densities:  1 seed/pot (30 sq cm/seed); 10 seeds/pot (3 sq cm/seed; seed-seed distance 1.75 cm); 100 seeds/pot (0.3 sq cm/seed; seed-seed distance 0.55 cm); 1,000 seeds/pot (0.03 sq cm/seed; seed-seed distance 0.175 cm).<p>

	After the seed had been sown the sand was moistened with distilled water.  Six days later the seedling cotyledons were expanded and Hoagland's solution (HOAGLAND and SNYDER, 1933), with iron supplied as the ferric sodium salt of EDTA, was applied at normal strength (H); 1/10 dilution H/l0; and 1/100 dilution (H/100).  Thereafter at weekly intervals the pots were flushed with distilled water and recharged with the appropriate solution.  The experiment was carried out in a glasshouse with a 15 hours/9 hours light/dark alternation.  From the populations seed was collected daily over a fruiting period of six weeks by cutting off ripe fruits. The seed was subsequently counted and expressed as the total seed production of each population over the 2 1/2 month duration of the experiment.<p>

	Results and discussion:  Seed production of the population is shown in Figure 1.  Populations supplied with the H and H/10 solutions showed a homeostatic plateau of seed production at densities greater than 10 seeds/pot.  Similar plateaus of seed output with increasing density have been shown to occur in other annual plant species (HARPER, 1961).  However, populations supplied with the H/100 solution showed a peak seed output at the sowing density of 100 seeds/pot.  At the sowing density of 1,000 seeds/pot seed output was markedly reduced to a level below that of even the single plant/pot population.<p>

	Figure 2 shows seed output as seed production per plant.  Homeostasis of seed output shown by populations supplied with the H and H/10 solutions was achieved by adjustment in the form and seed output of individual plants rather than by mortality of the plants in the populations.  This adjustment of form included overall plant size, the development of side branches, the number and size of fruits produced, and the number of seeds/siliqua.<p>

	Figure 2 demonstrates that in the populations supplied with H/100 solution and at a sowing density of 1,000 seeds/pot seed production of individual plants was below the critical level of 1 plant giving rise to 1 seed.  In fact, mortality occurred in these populations. This was sudden and extensive after the plants, which were minute, had been at the early leaf stages for nearly two months.  However, no pathogenic cause was detected and death was attributed primarily to starvation. After this wave of mortality a few survivors flowered and fruited amongst which the limiting condition of  seed/plant appeared to predominate.<p>

	Ecologically, the results suggest that field populations growing at low levels of available nutrients are more density-dependent in seed output than populations growing at higher levels of available nutrients.  In this way, population density at low nultrient levels is potentially more sensitively controlled by inherent population feed-back mechanisms.<p>

	Implicit in the phenotypic plasticity exhibited by Arabidopsis thaliana in this experiment is the necessary precaution of standardising growth conditions in any critical comparative study of variation within the species.<p>

	Details and a fuller discussion of the experimental findings are to be submitted for publication elsewhere.<p>

<h2>Use of Arabidopsis for mineral nutrition experiments</h2><p>

	Arabidopsis thaliana, grown in aseptic culture on chemically defined agar media, is an ideal tool for mineral nutrition research.  A great diversity of races and mutant types is available for study, and the media is easily altered to produce any complete or partial mineral deficiency desired.<p>

	In a class experiment, "Estland" wild type was grown under 24 hour photoperiod in a media in which NaNO3 replaced KNO3.  The composition of this media per plant is as follows:<p>

	Every two days ten plants grown in the potassium deficient media and ten control plants were harvested, and the fresh and dry weight was obtained.  &#197;t the final harvest, the dry plant material was bulked and ashed.  The ask was dissolved in 5% HCl, and the potassium content determined with a BECKMAN flame spectrophotometer at 767 millimicrons with reference to a standard curve.  Germination rate, flowering time, and the visible appearance of the plants was also noted.<p>

	95% of the seeds sown on the potassium free media germinated, but the potassium deficient plants grew more slowly than the controls (Fig. 1).  The floral meristem elongated only about 1 cm, the older rosette leaves died before flowering, and all leaves had a red color.  The results of the photometric analysis are:<p>

	However, these severe visible and chemical symptoms of potassium deficiency are strongly contrasted by the normal life cycle of the stressed plants. The experimental plants had a mean flowering time of 22 days after sowing, only one day later than the control.<p>

	The only source of potassium was that provided by the seed and contamination in the media, which was evidently limited to very low levels.  Despite such a severe environmental stress, and the severe restriction on growth imposed by this, the potassium deficient plants were reserved; all flowered producing small pods.  From these twenty plants, however, only two seeds were obtained.<p>

Arabidopsis as an indicator of soil fertility<p>

	A few years ago it was observed that on the different soil batches, brought to the greenhouse, the growth of Arabidopsis greatly varied with apparently no association with the visible structure, color or other obvious characteristics of the samples.  Later six other samples were simultaneously collected.  Four of the samples included soil from the maize breeding nursery.  One was taken from the continuous corn plot (corn since 1889) of the Sanborn Field of the University (historical site from which S. A. WAKSMAN isolated the fungus producing the antibiotic Aureomycin).  One sample was obtained from the never cultivated field known as the Tucker Virgin Prairie.<p>

	Maize and Arabidopsis were seeded in pots using the six soil sources. Dry matter of seedling plants was determined for each species on each lot.<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol04/vol04-pg28-tab1.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

	The extremely low weight of Arabidopsis on the Tucker Virgin Prairie Soil was not expected.  The relative response of the maize growth on the six samples was in line with previous knowledge of their respective levels of fertility. The varied response of Arabidopsis on these six soils suggest some element was limiting its growth which cannot readily be detected by the growth of maize.<p>

	A recent experiment demonstrated that with phosphorous application (5 ml 0.2 M Sorensen buffer per each 3-inch pot) normal yield of Arabidopsis can be obtained even on soil samples No. 5 and 6.  It appears that Arabidopsis is a very efficient indicator of readily available phosphorous content of the soil.<p>

	It is interesting to note the dry weight of maize on sample No. 5 is in excellent agreement with the data collected on Sanborn Field during the first 49 years of the experiment, where continuous corn (no fertilization) had a forage yield 68.6% relative to continuous corn with 6 tons manure applied annually (SMITH, 1942).<p>
