The dose of chemical mutagen is known to be expressed as concentration
multiplied by the time, D = C x t (BLIXT, EHRENBERG and GELIN, 1966).
To our knowledge, however, there are no experiments comparing the
effect of lasting treatment by low concentrations with that of brief
high concentration treatment, D = C x t = const. being observed.
There are grounds to believe that a study of the differences in the
effect of these two types of treatment may prove essential for the
problem of dose-effect relationships.<p>

Our study of the effects of treatment with N-nitrosomethyl urea of
Arabidopsis thaliana HEYNH. dry seeds (race En-1) revealed the
following regularities.  Doses equal in value may prove both equal
different as to their biological and genetic effects in M1 and M2.
Doses in the range under investigation proved to be equivalent for
germination capacity which is of little sensitivity.  Germinating
capacity was reduced down to 50% with respect to the control in all
the tested products equalling 25 mM x hr, no matter by what components
they had been formed. The same was true for less toxic doses.<p>

For the effects of viability, sterility, leaf spotting in M1 and
mutation rate in M2 non-equivalence of equal dose products of
concentration multiplied by exposure time was revealed.  The
non-equivalence in the range of similar, equal-value doses manifested
itself in the fact that the effect changed proportionally to exposure
or concentration values.  In fact, for the doses 12 mM x hr changes in
viability were directly proportional to concentration values, for
higher doses changed directly proportionally to exposure values.  The
effect of leaf spotting for all the tested doses changes in a direct
proportion to exposure which appears of special interest and calls for
further investigation.  For that purpose the dose range, especially of
those inducing the given effect (3 mM x hr to 15 mM x hr) was tested
for the widest possible set of factors. The actual values for the
exposure are determined by the ability of the seeds of retaining
viability after excessively long soaking and mutagen solubility for
concentrations. The solutions were prepared in phosphate citrate
buffer pH 5.0, t = 22*degrees*.  The exposure time was expressed in
hours, NMU concentration in millimoles.  The concentration and
exposure values were placed by the sides of a square similar to Punnet
lattice, in the points of crossing the values, doses being marked as
products of both the values (Fig. 1). Equal values are thus found
along certain diagonals of the square.  After treatment the plants
were grown in test-tubes in vegetation chamber.  The effect under
investigation, the rate of chlorophyll chimerae (leaf spotting) in M1
were expressed as the ratio of the number of the plants with spots on
the rosette leaves to all the plants at rosette stage in the given
variant.  Statistical treatment of the data obtained by means of
dispersion analysis for one-factor complexes revealed that the results
are highly significant (P &lt; 0.01).  Figure 2 shows significant
differences in the effect values along the diagonals, i.e., for doses
equal in value.  For D = C x t = const. the rate of chlorophyll
chimerae in M1 increases with an increase of the exposure duration and
the corresponding decrease of the concentration.  It can be concluded,
therefore, that the effect is determined by the time factor.  In
addition, dose testing in a wide range made it possible to reveal an
opposite direction of "dose curves" for two indices: the rate of
chlorophyll chimerae in M1 and mutation rate in M2.  The dose which
provides the maximum of mutation rate and also more high doses
connected with further decline corresponded to the dose range in which
the effect of chlorophyll chimerae began to manifest itself and
increased which is in keeping with some previously obtained data
(GICHNER and VELEMINSKY, 1966).  Both the above mentioned features
give ground for certain assumptions concerning the nature of
chlorophyll chimerae themselves.  Besides the assumptions of plastid,
gene and chromosomal mutations underlying this phenomenon (ROBBELEN,
1965; BLIXT and GELIN, 1965) can be evolved another hypothesis.  A
tissue area with some chlorophyll defect can be regarded as somatic
offspring of a changed embryonal cell which underwent a chlorophyll
mutation under NMU effect connected with induced exchange.  The above
process which was previously referred to as muta-crossingover (RAPPORT
and DEMCHENKO, 11969), provides the transfer of the recessive mutation
into homozygote and, thus, its phenotypical manifestation in M1.  We
hope to support this assumption by means of spot tissue culture
experiments. The transition of the changed somatic cell through the
non-differentiating callus growth and further regeneration to the
pathway of gametophyte will make it possible to analyse the alteration
which took place in it.  These experiments are underway.<p>
