<h2> Mutation induction by fractionated doses of isopropyl methanesulfonate in Arabidopsis</h2><p>

Isopropyl methanesulfonate (iPMS) is a monofunctional alkylating agent
which reacts so fast that mutation experiments without after-effects
can easily be arranged (MULLER, 1967). The rate constant for the
reaction with water is 0.71 per hr at 25*degrees*C (EHRENBERG et al.,
1966).<p>

In experiment I anaerobically presoaked seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana,
race 'Dijon G' were treated with 80 mM iPMS (buffered, pH7, prepared
at the start of treatment) for 1 hr at 24*degrees*C.  This treatment
was repeated either immediately or after 3 hrs, 12 hrs, 23 hrs and 47
hrs storage in N2-water at 24*degrees*C.  Other variants were exposed
only to the first or the second treatment respectively (see table).
51 hrs after the first treatment all variants were transferred to
aerobic conditions allowing germination.  In experiment II presoaked
seeds were treated with 40 mM iPMS at 24*degrees*C for 1 hr, 2 hrs, 3
hrs and 4 hrs.  (After each hour the solution was renewed.)  After
treatment the seeds were washed and submerged in water for 3 hrs.  The
frequencies of embryonic lethals and chlorophyll mutations were
determined by the embryo test (MULLER, 1966).  The results are
summarized in the table.<p>

From the results the following conclusions may be drawn: (1) Mutation
induction proceeds at an increasing rate as treatment time increases.
Therefore, the dose-response relation is described by a sigmoid curve,
if the frequency of mutated cells (or silique progenies) is considered
and by a shoulder curve, if the mean number of mutations per cell (or
progeny) is considered. (2) The mutagenic response is not
significantly influenced by the dose rate (4 x 40 mM vs. 2 x 80 mM).
(3) Dose fractionation does not significantly change the mutation
frequency, at least, if the interval between the treatments does not
exceed 24 hrs.  The first treatment yields relatively few mutations,
but sensitizes in some way the seeds to the second treatment. The
sensitized state is stable under anaerobic conditions.<p>

As pointed out previously (MULLER, 1966) the shape of the dose curve
does not indicate a definite mechanism.  Even if the results do not
significantly differ from the equation M = aD2 there is no reason to
consider only a two-hit mechanism and to ignore other explanations.
One of these involves the progressive inactivation of a repair system
by the mutational treatment.  But is also possible that mutations are
far more probable after a double alkylation within a DNA region than
after a single alkylation.  These explanations could account equally
well for the results of the dose fractionation experiment because
both, the alkylation of DNA and the inactivation of the repair system
could be preserved in anaerobically stored seeds.<p>

All dose curves obtained with chemical mutagens in Arabidopsis (e.g.,
GICHNER, 1965); GICHNER and VELEMINSKY, 1967; MULLER, 1964, 1966, and
unpubl.) are shoulder curves, i.e., they differ significantly from a
linear curve. This is true also for the results published by Van der
VEEN (1968).  The special interpretation proposed by this author is
based on the supposition that there is a constant threshold dose for
all seeds (and cells) of the treated population.  (Note, that Van der
VEEN cites the results of MULLER (1966) incompletely and incorrectly
and that indeed his interpretation cannot be applied to these
results.)<p>
