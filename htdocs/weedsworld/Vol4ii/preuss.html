Session 3: Cell Signalling</H1>

<P>Many aspects of plant development are regulated by communication between
cells, and several examples were described in the session on cell signalling.

<P>In the <I>Arabidopsis </I>root meristem, initial cells divide in a stereotypical
manner to generate the radial pattern of the root. Philip Benfey (New York
University) described characterization of two mutations, <I>scarecrow</I>
(<I>scr</I>) and <I>short-root </I>(<I>shr</I>), that disrupt the normal
division pattern of the initial that generates the root cortex and endodermis.
Apparently, SHR is required for endodermal differentiation and SCR for
regulation of the longitudinal asymmetric division. <I>SCR</I> encodes
a putative transcriptional regulator expressed in the endodermal cell file
and in the cortex/endodermal initial. The progressive refinement observed
in the SCR expression pattern during root regeneration suggests that radial
patterning involves positional information possibly transmitted through
cell-cell signalling within the regenerating region.

<P>The development of the <I>Arabidopsis</I> floral meristem is also regulated
by cell signalling. A fixed number of floral organs arranged in four concentric
whorls is achieved through regulated proliferation and differentiation
of meristem cells. Hajime Sakai (Meyerowitz lab, California Institute of
Technology) has cloned and analyzed the function of the <I>SUPERMAN</I>
(<I>SUP</I>) gene, a putative transcription factor with a zinc finger domain.
SUP appears to regulate cell division in whorls that form stamens and carpels,
but functions antagonistically in each whorl. In the stamen whorl, SUP
functions to repress cell division, but it promotes division in the carpel.

<P>Pollination requires the establishment of cell-cell interactions between
male and female cells that do not share a common developmental lineage.
Daphne Preuss (University of Chicago) described mutations that provide
insight into two stages of pollination: 1) interactions between pollen
and stigma cells, and 2) guidance of pollen tubes to ovules. The major
pollen surface components consist of a family of oleosin-containing proteins
that likely mediate interactions between proteins and lipids at the pollen-stigma
interface. Alterations that alter the abundance of lipids and proteins
on the pollen surface cause defects in pollen hydration. Subsequent interactions
between pollen tubes and pistil cells require the action of at least two
genes <I>POP2</I> and <I>POP3</I>. While expression of these genes in the
pistil is sufficient to rescue function of mutant pollen tubes, recent
genetic tests indicate that pollen tubes that encode wild-type alleles
have a growth advantage over their mutant counterparts.

<P>On the epidermal surface, regulated cell division and cell expansion
are required to achieve an organized pattern of stomates, trichomes and
root hairs. Fred Sack (Ohio State University) described the cellular interactions
that occur during stomatal patterning. Strikingly, wild-type <I>Arabidopsis</I>
plants rarely form two stomata in contact with each other. This regular
pattern results from the controlled placement of asymmetric cell divisions,
such that precursor cells are not formed near existing stomata. The too
many mouths mutant forms stomatal clusters that result, in part, from the
misplacement of these divisions, causing precursors to form adjacent to
existing stomata.

<P>Leaf petioles offer another example of regulated cell expansion. Tony
Schaeffner (Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet) described tortifolia (<I>tor</I>)
mutations that affect morphogenesis of the petiole of <I>Arabidopsis</I>
leaves. The mutants have twisted petioles, and curiously, the direction
of twisting is gene-specific, with recessive <I>tor1</I> and <I>tor2</I>
defects causing right-handed torsion, and semi-dominant <I>tor3</I> defects
causing left-handed twisting. Petiole twisting in these mutants is caused
by uneven cell expansion, and not by differences in the rates of cell division,
and the <I>tor</I> phenotype is not controlled by environmental factors,
such as phytohormones, light, or gravity. <I>tor1</I> maps near to a mutation
called <I>spr2</I> (Takashi Hashimoto, Nara Institute of Science and Technology,
Japan) that causes hypocotyl torsion and root slanting.</BLOCKQUOTE>
