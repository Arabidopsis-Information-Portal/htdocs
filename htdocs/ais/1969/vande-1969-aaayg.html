Netherlands)<p>

Prior to the present experiment, VAN DER VEEN and WIRTZ (1968) carried
out a small scale model selection experiment to assess the frequency
of EMS-induced genic male steriles: Having treated Landsberg-'erecta'
seeds with 10 mM EMS (24*degrees*C, 24 hrs), they selected 116
M1-plants for harvesting one fully fertile fruit per plant, and
screened the 116 M2's (size 12 plants) for fruit-length resp.
pollen-release.  Six promising recessive male steriles were carried on
to M3 (via heterozygotes), backcrossed to the parent of origin, and
reselected.  A 6 x 6 diallel between heterozygotes showed the 6
mutations to be at 5 different loci.  Four of the six lines were
discarded for incomplete expression of m.s. and/or partial expression
of m.s. in the heterozygote, 3) complete female fertility, and 4) no
phenotypic differences with the parent of origin other than those
resulting from sterility.  The second line (Ms2-Ms2) is equally good,
but ms2ms2 switches to male fertility in the later flowers.  Both
lines have normal meiosis in pollen mother cells and young pollen
formation, but the pollen decays while the anthers fail to open.<p>

MULLER (1968) reported an X-ray induced recessive male sterile in race
Dijon G.<p>

The present authors treated seeds of line Ms1-ms1 with 10 mM EMS
(24*degrees*C, 24 hrs), and the M1 consisted of 754 fertiles and 796
male steriles (expected 775 and 775; P= 0.30 - 0.20).  On 9 of the
male steriles a fully or nearly fully fertile sector was found, either
in the main inflourescence or as a side branch, the remaining parts of
these plants being completely male sterile.  N.B.  Spontaneous
crosspollination produces at the most an occasional seed on
ms1ms1-plants.<p>

In all 9 cases, restored fertility was transmitted to the M2 (see
Table), i.e., the revertant M1-sectors were not "physiologically"
induced by EMS-treatment, but resulted from dominant mutations, which
moreover were carried by the sporocyte tissue itself!  (Though
cytoplasmic restoration seems unlikely in view of the segregation
patterns in M2 and M3, we are nevertheless carrying out the test ms1
ms1 x pollen from fertiles).<p>

Further points shown by the Table are:<p>

1.  The 9 M2's (36 seedlings transplanted per fam.) had fertile:
sterile segregations varying from 2:1 (No. 5) to 1:1 (No. 7).  In the
case of EMS-induced pyrimidineless-to-normal revertants (VAN DEN BERG
and FEENSTRA, 1968), the mutant homozygotes were phenotypically
non-revertant (leading to 1:1, which indicates interallelic
complementation.  In our case, however, a progeny-test of all fertile
M2-plants by means of M3 (24 seedlings transplanted per fam.),
revealed resp. 5, 6 2 and 2 homozygous fertiles in No's 1, 2, and 3.
Moreover, the consistent decrease of revertant-deficit from M2 to M3
(all segregating fam. pooled per descent), leads us to expect that
also in No's 4 till 9, fertile (= RR) homozygotes will be found.<p>

2.  The revertant-deficit can be explained on the basis of gametic
selection.  A high level of seed-set excludes selective
non-fertiliztaion of egg-cells.  Here, we will test the model of
certation, thus excluding selection in the female tetrads, i.e.
assuming 1:1 among the eggcells. Denoting the relative frequencies of
R- and r-pollen by p' and q', and the observed rel. freq. of RR, Rr
and rr by f1 f1 and f0, the expected rel. freq. are 1/2p, 1/2 and
1/2q. Then q' (see Table) can be estimated as 2 f0. (Of course, after
progeny testing q' can be obtained via f) + 1/2f1 = 1/2q + 1/4).
Significant is that the M2 contains about 50% Rr (expected 1/2N).  It
should be noted that phenotypic extension (by enzymatic crossfeeding)
of genotypic Rr-sectors in M1 will also lead to an rr-excess in M2,
but at the same time to less than 50% Rr.  In fact, No's 5, 6, 8 and 9
rather show a small excess of Rr.  Finally, it is seen that certation
(q') consistently decreases from M2 to M3, though at varying rates.
Similar trends with chlorophyll mutants have been ascribed by various
authors to certation, diminished in successive generations by natural
selection in the pollen.<p>

At the moment we are trying to find RR in all 9 descents, and make a
10 x 10 diallel (including Ms2 Ms1) to test for allelism with the Ms1
Ms1 locus, resp. for allelism at other loci (external suppressor
loci).  This involves 45 large F2's to distinguish between
non-segregation and at best 15:1 segregation.<p>
