TRANSFORMATION OF ARABIDOPSIS BY VACUUM INFILTRATION

This protocol is based on the work of Nicole Bechtold, Jeff Ellis and
Georges Pelletier.  My modifications were incorporated to streamline
their procedure.  The most significant changes eliminate the need to
uproot and re-plant infiltrated plants.  - Andrew Bent

Plant Growth:

1.  Grow plants of the appropriate genotype to a stage at which bolts
are just emerging.

I have found that it works well to grow 12-15 plants in a 3.5" pot.
If pot is covered with nylon window screen after planting, plants grow
through the screen and when pot is inverted for infiltration less dirt
falls out.  If plants are grown for the first four weeks in short days
you will get larger plants and a greater seed yield (transfer plants
to long days to induce bolting).  Success may also depend on frequent
fertilization and strong light intensity.

2.  Clip off emerging bolts to encourage growth of multiple secondary
bolts.

Infiltration will be done four to eight days after clipping.

Vacuum Infiltration:

3.  Grow a large liquid culture of Agrobacterium carrying the
appropriate construct.

Start a 25 ml overnight (LB + antibiotics) two to three days ahead of
time.  Add this culture to 400ml of LB + antibiotic the day before
infiltration.  My experiments were done using A. tumefaciens
GV3101pMP90 (C. Koncz and J.  Schell, 1986,
Mol. Gen. Genet. 204:383-396).

4.  Harvest cells by centrifugation (5K 10min. in GSA rotor,
preferably at room temp.) and resuspend in 3 volumes infiltration
medium (OD600 approx.  0.8).

Harvest cells at an OD600 of >2.0.  A 400 ml culture will give enough
cells for infiltration of at least six pots.

5.  Add Agrobacterium (in infiltration medium) to a dish or beaker and
invert plants (pot, soil, and all) into liquid solution.  Be sure
bolts and entire rosettes are submerged.

A one liter beaker filled with >200 ml of solution fits well with our
3.5" pots.  Bacterial solution can be extended by reusing for at least
one additional pot.

6.  Place beaker into bell jar.  Draw a vacuum until bubbles form on
leaf and stem surface and solution starts to bubble a bit, then
release vacuum very rapidly.

The necessary time and vacuum pressure will vary lab-to-lab.  Practice
on a few dispensable plants first. Good infiltration is visibly
apparent as uniformly darkened, water-soaked tissue.  Be sure to have
good traps in your vacuum system or you will quickly saturate the pump
oil.

7.  Remove plants from beaker, lay them on their side into a plastic
flat and cover with plastic wrap or a dome to maintain humidity.  The
next day, uncover plants and set upright.

8.  Grow approximately four weeks, keeping bolts from each pot
together and separated from neighboring pots.

9.  When siliques on plants are very dry, harvest seed (all seed from
one pot together).

Selection of Putative Transformants:

Kanamycin selection protocol: (Note that Basta selection is much less
labor intensive - but your present binary vector system is more likely
to encode antibiotic resistance.)

10.  Pour selection plates.

Plastic 150 x 15 mm petri dishes are convenient.

11.  Sterilize seed.

A variety of sterilization protocols are appropriate.
I place seed in 15 ml plastic orange cap tubes and then treat:
1 minute in ethanol or isopropanol
5 minutes in 50% Bleach/50% water/0.05% Tween.
3 rinses with sterile water.

It is advisable to add one or two control seeds from a known
transformed plant onto a marked location on at least a few of the
selection plates.  Sterilize these seed also.

12.  Plate seed by resuspending in sterile, room temperature 0.1%
agarose and spreading onto selection plates.  Dry plates in laminar
flow hood until seed no longer flows when plate is tipped.

Use one ml agarose for every 500-1000 seed.  Plate 2000 to 4000 seed
per 150 x 15 mm plate.  Higher densities can make antibiotic selection
less effective.

13.  Vernalize plates for two nights in cold room.  Move plates to
growth chamber.

14.  After about 7 days, transformants should be clearly identifiable
as dark green plants with healthy green secondary leaves and roots
that extend over and into the selective medium.

15.  Transplant plantlets to soil,  grow, and collect seed.

Transplanting success is improved by breaking up agar around root
prior to pulling, by removing any adhering chunks of agar from root
before planting, by saturation of soil with water after transplanting,
and by growing plants under a dome (for high humidity) for the first
day or two.  If you break the root, put plantlet onto a new selection
plate for a few days before transplanting.


Infiltration Medium:
 1/2 X Murashige & Skoog salts
 1 X B5 vitamins
 5.0% Sucrose
 .044 uM Benzylamino Purine
     (10 ul per liter of a 1 mg/ml stock in DMSO)

Selection Plates:
   1/2 X Murashige & Skoog salts
   0.8% Agar
 Autoclave, cool, then add:
   1 X B5 vitamins
   Antibiotic (such as Km 50 ug/ml)
