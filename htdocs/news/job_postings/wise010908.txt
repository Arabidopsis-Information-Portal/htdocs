Postdoctoral Position - Bioinformatics/Computational Biology 
USDA-ARS / Iowa State University 
Functional Genomics of Plant Disease Defense 
 
A postdoctoral research position is available immediately in the Crop 
Genomics and Informatics Laboratory (CGIL), a collaborative effort of 
ARS and Iowa State University scientists.  The overall goals of the 
"Functional Genomics of Plant Disease Defense" project are to utilize 
genomics tools and resources to accelerate comparative analysis of 
disease defense pathways important in agriculture 
(http://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0500461). 
 
The candidate will work with a team responsible for molecular, 
genetic, and functional characterization of genes associated with and 
required for R-gene mediated resistance responses using barley 
powdery mildew and barley stem rust as model systems.  The candidate 
will work with GeneNetwork [http://www.genenetwork.org/] to integrate 
eQTL analysis modules into the multi-crop plant expression database, 
PLEXdb [http://plexdb.org/] to enable visualization and analysis of 
quantitative gene expression- and trait data collected from 
segregating populations and diversity panels.  Biologically relevant 
co-expression networks will be extracted and tested for function in 
disease defense. 
 
Recent Ph.D. in Bioinformatics/Computational Biology or a closely 
related field is required.  Knowledge of Genetics/Cell 
Biology/Pathology/Biochemistry are desirable.  Salary starts at 
$54,494 (GS-11).  Funding is available for two years with possibility 
of extension.
