Postdoc in Functional Genomics and Natural Variation

A two year postdoctoral position is available in the Department of Biology at
Duke University to study molecular genetics of plant defense. The applicant
must have a PhD degree in molecular biology, biochemistry, genetics, or a
related field. Prior experience with plant biochemistry, Arabidopsis genetics,
transformation, and other genomics methods is desirable.  The research project
involves functional characterization of loci controlling the biochemistry of
plant defense.

Our laboratory is located in the French Family Science Center, a very new
facility housing a number of lab groups with closely related interests. Recent
work in our laboratory is summarized at:

Funding is available for two years beginning immediately, with the possibility
of further extension. Interested applicants should email a cover letter, a
brief statement of research experience, CV and names and contact information of
three references to: Dr. Thomas Mitchell-Olds, tmo1@duke.edu.  Duke University
is an equal opportunity employer.
