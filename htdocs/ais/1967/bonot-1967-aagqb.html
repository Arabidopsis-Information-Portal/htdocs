	In previous investigations on the penetration of heterologous 3H-DNA in Arabidopsis (BONOTTO, JACOBS, and LEDOUX, 1965) it was found that the labelled macromolecules were taken up either by the plant in toto or by its isolated organs. The results reported here indicate that the presence of disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate (EDTA) in the incubation mixture increases the penetration of the exogenous labelled DNA.  <p>

	Rosette leaves cut from 49 day-old plants were incubated for different periods of time in 0.01 M NaCl or in 0.01 M NaCl plus 0.066 M EDTA, both containing 40 micro g/ml of 3H-DNA (3H-DNA of Escherechia coli having a specific activity of 2.2 x 10-E6 dpm/micgo g). The leaves were then washed nine times (3 times with 0.01 with 0.01 M Nacl, 3 times with unlabelled DNA in 0.01 M Nacl, and 3 times with distilled water) in order to eliminate contaminant 3H-DNA, and assayed for total radioactivity by liquid scintillation after a two-hour hydrolysis at 60*degres*C with hydroxide of hyamine. The results of this experiment are given in Figure 1.<p>

	In two other experiments the roots of 34-day-old flowering plants (15-25 cm long) were placed 20 hours in contact with labelled DNA dissolved in 0.01 M NaCl plus 0.066 M EDTA respectively.  The plants were then washed as mentioned for the leaves and cut into 1 cm long segments which were assayed for total radioactivity.  In order to eliminate the error due to contamination, the roots which were in contact with the labelled DNA were cut and discarded. The results of these experiments are reported in Table 1.<p>

	Our findings indicate that EDTA increases notably the uptake of a heterologous 3H-DNA into the isolated rosette leaves (Figure 1) and the transport from the roots to the stem and to the flowers (Table 1).<p>

	It was reported that EDTA enhances the action of some chemical antibacterial agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa NCTC 8203 and NCTC 7244 and against Escherichia coli (BROWN and RICHARDS, 1965).  Moreover, EDTA enhanced the action of lysozyme on Ps. aeruginosa (REPASKE, 1958) and the absorption of heparin from the gastro-intestinal tract of rats (WINDSOR and CHRONHEIM, 1961).<p>

	Pretreatment with EDTA caused an increase in the frequency of chromosomal aberrations induced by the polyfunctional alkylating agent triethylenemelamine (TEM) or by N-nitroso-N-methylurea (NMH) in root meristems of Vicia faba (MICHAELIS and RIEGER, 1965; MICHAELIS et al. 1965).  No sensitization with EDTA, however, was observed in treatments with l-methyl-3-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidine in Vicia faba (GICHNER et al., 1963) and with EDTA and X-rays in Drosophila melanogaster (ONDREJ, 1965).  In Arabidopsis EDTA did not influence the mutagenic activity of EMS (GICHNER and VELEMINSKY, 1965) and only slightly diminished the mutation frequency by NMH (MULLER, 1966).<p>

	In our experiments the effect of EDTA might be related to its well known chelating properties.  The removal of Mg++ or Ca++ or both from the cell wall may affect its physico-chemical properties so that permeability barriers to foreign macromolecules were strongly reduced.  It is known in fact from electron microscopic investigations that after EDTA treatment the structure of cell walls in pea roots becomes loosened (KLEIN and GINZBURG, 1960).<p>

	Another hypothesis to explain the action of EDTA (TIZIO, 1965) is that the observed stimulation of the permeability to 3H-DNA might depend on the inhibition or activation of enzymes involved in the absorption process.<p>
