Recent advances in culturing plant cells now make it possible to apply
the powerful techniques of microbial genetics to higher forms. These
new developments include the production, culture, selective plating,
regeneration, and diploidization of haploid cells as well as
protoplast formation, fusion and uptake of exogenously supplied
molecules and particles. The stage is now set for the induction,
detection and identificiaton of desired mutants for the study of
biosynthetic pathways and for increasing desirable agronomic
characteristics.<p>

Plant cells can be grown indefinitely as masses of undifferentiated
cells on agar (tissue culture) or as very small cell aggregates with
isolated cells remaining dispersed as they grow in liquid media
(suspension cultures).  Such cells required mineral salts, a carbon
source, several vitamins, and hormones to support growth and
proliferation. Cells grown in suspension culture appear to te
unorganized and do not show any obvious structural and biochemical
evidence for function other than continuous division.  However, when
cultured under suitable conditions--and this has been shown in a few
species--they can be induced to differentiate, yielding complete
plants. The process of morphogenesis from unorganized cells may occur
either by embryoogenesis in the absence of exogenous hormones or by
organogenesis, induced by cytokinetins.<p>

Recently advances have been made in defining techniques for isolating
protoplasts and their regenertion into whole plants.  Protoplasts
(wall-less cells) are generally obtained by treating cells or tissues
with hydrolytic enzymes. The nutritional requirements of protoplasts
are similar to those of cells cultured in vitro.  It has been shown to
be possible to prepare protoplasts under conditions which prevent or
permit their fusion. This opens up the exciting prospect of somatic
cell hybridizaiton (using eithr diploid or haploid protoplasts.<p>

Tissue Culture in Arabidopsis<p>

One can very easily obtain "callus" from Arabidopsis thaliana. The
first tissue cultures were obtained in 1965 from seedlings
(Loewenberg, 1965) and from hypocotyl (Zieburg, 1965) and in 1966 from
seeds (Shen and Sharp, 1966 or part of mature plants (Yokoyama and
Jones, 1965). Suspension cultures can also be obtained very easily
(Anand, 1966; Corcos, 1971; Corcos and Lewis, 1972).  The introduction
in the medium of coconut milk or kinetin induces the formation of
callus.  The presence of 2-4D at a concentration of not less than
10E-6 facilitates the growth of an undifferentiated callus.  If 2-4D
is at a lower concentration, root primordia grow and develop as roots
(Anand, 1966; Corcos and Lewis, 1972).  It is only above 1 milligram
of 2-4D per liter that the tissue looks completely undifferentiated
(Negrutiu, Beeftink and Jacobs, 1975).  2-4D can be replaced with
para-chlorophenoxyacetic acid and coconut by kinetin without
impairment of growth (Corcos and Lewis, 1971).  Addition of vegetable
juice (V-8 brand) instead of just vitamins seems desirable since it
leads to a faster growth of tissue. Callus masses in a medium
containing vitamins instead of V-8 juice are irregular in shape with
irregular growth points and contain a large number of tracheids.
Dextrose instead of sucrose has been shown to be a better carbon
source (Negrutiu, Beeftink, and Jacobs, 1975).<p>

In our laboratory we have obtained the best growth in liquid medium
containing Heller minerals, 20g of dextrose/liter, 90cc of filtered
vegetable juice (V-8), lmg of kinetin and 3mgs of 2-4D per liter. The
tissue forms round, nodular yellow clumps of cells which shows little
internal differentiation, only a few tracheids. &#160;Suspension
cultures from stem, root, and hypocotyl have been established as
permanent cultures which are subcultured every three months (Corcos
and Lewis, 1971).<p>

That organogenesis is possible with Arabidopsis was discovered very
early.  Yakoyama and Jones (1965) found that by varying the
concentrations of IAA and kinetin, they could control root and shoot
formation from undifferentiated tissue. Stewart, Kent and Mapes in a
study of sequential and synergistic effects of growth regulating
substances observed differentiation (1967).  But Corcos, Piper, and
Lewis (1973) showed that a simple transfer of cells from suspension
media into solid media containing IAA (0/.03 mg/liter) and kinetin (1
mg/liter) permitted the formation of roots, shoots, flowers, and seeds
that germinated and gave rise to normal diploid plants.  However, this
redifferentiation seems to be affected by seasonal factors
independently of humidity, light, and temperature.  Recently,
(Demchenko, Avetisov, and Butenko, 1975), the use of tissue has been
proposed to investigate the origin of chlorophyll chimeras in M1 after
mutagenic treatment.<p>

It has been possible to get callus and plant regeneration from
chlorophyll defective cells.  However, all attempts to produce seeds
from these regenerants failed. The reason for this failure in
sporogenesis has not been elucidated.<p>

Cultures of haploid cells and of protoplasts have been recently
obtained.  Haploid tissue and plants which originated from anthers
were cultured successively on mineral salts, vitamins, iron chelate,
sucrose agar, IAA or NAA and kinetin (Gresshoff and Doy, 1972).  Young
actively dividing cells in tissue and cell suspension cultures gave
the best release of protoplasts which stayed alive for some weeks.
However, no cell division was observed (Negrutiu, Beeftink, and
Jacobs, 1975). These successes should not blind us to the difficulties
ahead. There are many problems to be solved before we can efficiently
use tissue culture in our biochemical studies with Arabidopsis.<p>

Cells and plants derived from tissue and cell cultures are in many
cases far from being identical to the original ones, possibly because
of changes in chromosome numbers as well as mutation and natural
selection.  Mutation and cytological instability provide us with a
wide range of viable genotypes, but they pose the problem whether it
will be possible to preserve a particular genotype in continuous
culture. Genetical stability is critical for the isolation of point
mutations and their exploitation for biochemical pathway studies.
Fortunately, it has been shown that the incorporation of chemicals
into the culture medium might help in preserving the haploid state.
This has been shown to be the case with parafluorophenylalanine with
tobacco. The auxins indoleatic acid and naphaleneacetic acid were both
reported to be better than 2-4D dichlorophenoxyacetic acid in the
culture media for maintaining stability of chromosome number. The fact
that we can induce diploid and haploid cells to produce normal plants
by exogenous supplies of auxins should not let us forget that this
method, though highly practical, is crude and artificial. These
hormones are probbly foreign to the tissue itself and the problem of
how endogenous phytohormones do indeed control differentiation remains
entire.  There may be new phytohormones to be discovered.  Obviously,
research in this field is at much more sophisticated level than that
of finding the right concentration of variable exogenous hormones via
the culture medium.<p>

In spite of these problems, we can consider the future of tissue and
cell culture in Arabidopsis as bright, for we shall have in the near
future at our disposition, two new methods of inquiry: the mass
production of haploid cells and protoplasts.  The genetic use of
single haploid cells is obvious--the uncovering and selectively
recovering induced variability. As to the use of protoplasts, it is
not envisaged for the purpose of combining existing variability as it
is with crop plants, but rather as an aid to introducing foreign
genetic material (from macromolecules to organelles).  Protoplast
culture is a suitable system to incorporate foreign DNA or viruses
into the cell and study the consequences of that incorporation. The
field of biochemical genetics of both haploid cells and protoplasts is
virtually virgin.<p>
