NITSCH (1967) reported that hypocotyl sections from Arabidopsis in the
presence of kinetin (1 mg/l) and adenine (10E-4) produced adventitious
buds which produced influorescence in long days.  YOKOYAMA and JONES
(1965) succeeded in slowly proliferating cotyledon, leaf, root and
stem tissue on Nickell's medium containing coconut milk and kinetin.
Redifferentiation was also reported in their abstract.  STEWARD, KENT
and MAPES (1967) in a study of sequential and synergistic effects of
growth regulating substances observed differentiation. Basal medium
(B) supplemented with 1.25-5.00 ppm naphtalene acetic acid (NAA)
promoted very active growth of the callus, whereas basal medium plus
coconut milk (CM) contributed to organization. When the media were
sequentially changed as follows (B+CM+NAA) moved to (B+NAA) moved to
(B) there was a clear improvement in morphogenetic development.<p>

culture<p>

We have been able to obtain an abundant formation of growth of callus
in a medium containing 2-4D, vitamins, kinetin, glucose, and minerals
(CORCOS and LEWIS, 1971).  Preliminary work indicated that a simple
transfer of callus on solid media containing I.A.A. (0.03 mg/l)
andkinetin (1 mg/l) prmits the formation of roots, shoots, flowers and
seeds.  A study in the Spring of 1972 was made to ascertain if this
was the best combination of the two hormones for differentiation from
Arabidopsis callus or it was shown for tobacco callus (SKOOG, 1957).<p>

Hypocotyl callus was grown on 9 different media. The basal medium was
the one of VELEMINSKY and GICHNER (1964) to which was added the
concentrations of kinetin and IAA given in Table 1.  For each
treatment, 20 replicate 100 ml test tubes with steel caps were used.
The test tubes were kept under constant light, at room temperature for
a period of four months, the time necessary for the callus to
differentiate rootts, leaves and stems, flowers and pods.  Table 1
summarizes the results.<p>

Table 1: Percentages of test tubes with roots, leaves, flowers and
pods are indicated<p>

Root differentiation occurred independently of the concentration of
kinetin or IAA.<p>

However, stems and leaves, flowers and pods differentiated only when
the concentration of kinetin was 1.0 to 1.5 mg/liter and IAA 0.03 to
0.3 mg/liter. The number of pods and seeds (as seen in the pods) was
greater when the concentration of IAA was 0.3 mg/liter which is ten
times grater than the concentration that SKOOG used.<p>

We can conclude that differentiation of callus into normal plants is
possible in media containing glucose (20 g/liter), 1.0 to 1.3 mg of
kinetin 0.03 to 0.3 mg of IAA liter without transfer to sequential
media.<p>
