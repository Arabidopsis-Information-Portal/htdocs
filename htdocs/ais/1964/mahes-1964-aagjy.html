Vol 01:<h2>MAHESHWARI, N., and R. D. IYER</h2><h2>Developmental conditions in Arabidopsis</h2>

Material of Arabidopsis thaliana procured from Saharanpur, India, and
from Netherlands is grown aseptically in test tubes on solid nutritive
medium.  The seeds are exposed to 8 *degrees*C for 48 hours for
optical germination.  Kinetin (10-6 mol.) and red light have been
found to enhance germination.  The critical photoperiod is 8 hours,
and 5 cycles are needed to induce flowering.  However primordia appear
12-15 days after germination of seeds and the entire life cycle is
completed within 21 days.  Kinetin promotes flowering at 10-1 and 10-8
mol.  The cold requirement of seeds cannot be replaced by gibberellins
or auxins.<p>
