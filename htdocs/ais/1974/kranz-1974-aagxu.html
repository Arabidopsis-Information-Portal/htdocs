<h2>Isolation of mutants defective in certain phytochrome-mediated photomorphosis</h2><p>

After a selection of mutants defective in phytochrome-mediated
photomorphogenesis we have isolated 6 of these mutants out of 30 lines
of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) HEYNH. These show an increased seed
germination by 5 minutes red after 10 minutes far red (FR+R) in
contrast to 10 minutes FR and 5 minutes R plus 5 minutes FR (FR+R+FR).
Two of these selected mutants originated from the wild type which was
obviously not stimulated by R.  One mutant resulted fromthe
chlorophyll b-defective mutant ch3, whose germination is slightly
increased by FR+R, and there are also two other mutants which are the
homoallelic mutants ch1 and ch2.  Whereas the mutant En-2 f1y+b
selected from the wild type shows an increase in the hypocotyl length
and the development of the cotyledons after FR plus R (figure 1), the
mutant ch3 shows only an increase of the hypocotyl length. This effect
is not significant in the mutants V81 v2 and En-2f1g (standard errors
are overlapping).  On the other hand hypocotyl lengthening is
significantly reduced after FR+R-compared with FR- and
FR+R+FR-treatment in the mutant ch2.<p>

Figure 1: Differences in certain phytochrome-mediated
photomorphogenetic reactions in 6 mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana.<p>

(R = red light with lambda max = 658 nm +- 60 nm and
0.95x10**4erg/cm**2/sec.  FR = far red light with lambda max = 725 nm
and lambda min &lt;= 680 nm and 0.65x10**4erg/cm**2/sec.) For methods
see DIEKMANN and KRANZ (1973).<p>

These results indicate that after FR+R the amount of activation of the
phytochrome to Pfr may be dependent on the specific genotype, and thus
very different photomorphogenetic phenomena are produced. This leads
to the following hypothesis for future work: The differences in
photomorphogenesis observed originate from 1) different primary
effects of various Pfr-forms, and/or 2) from different efficiencies of
one active Pfr form. In both cases certain genes need to be activated
for control of the further differentiation.<p>
