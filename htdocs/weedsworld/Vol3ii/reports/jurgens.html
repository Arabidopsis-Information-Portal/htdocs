<H1>Session 4: Embryogenesis</H1>
<H4>Chair: Gerd Juergens, Universitaet Tuebingen, Federal Republic of Germany</H4>

Various aspects of embryogenesis were addressed in the talks and posters
of this session: pattern formation, morphogenesis, cell expansion, cytokinesis,
promoter traps and somatic embryogenesis.<p>
<A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Norwich/sessions/S27.html" target="_top">K. Barton</A> (Madison) gave a detailed description of the localised expression
in the embryo of the <I>STM</I> gene involved in shoot meristem development
(Long <I>et al</I>., 1996, Nature <B>379</B>, 66-69). <I>STM</I> expression starts in the globular
embryo and then the pattern evolves in a specific way. No <I>STM</I> expression
was observed in topless embryos, while pinhead affects the later refinement,
and <I>clv1</I> and <I>clv3</I> enlarge the <I>STM</I> expressing region.
Conversely, <I>UFO</I> is not expressed in <I>stm</I> heart-stage embryos.
These results suggest that <I>STM</I> plays an important early role in shoot
meristem development. Related posters presented shoot meristem mutants (<I>zll,
wus, stm</I>; T. Laux lab, Tuebingen)
and root meristem mutants (<I>hb</I>t ; B. Scheres lab, Utrecht).
<p>
<A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Norwich/sessions/S29.html" target="_top">R.A. Torres Ruiz</A> (Munich) described mutations in several genes affecting
apical development of the embryo and reported on progress in cloning two
of the genes, <I>GK</I> and<I> PEP</I>. The <I>MP</I> gene involved in basal
development of the embryo was subject of a poster (T. Berleth lab, Munich).
The <I>MP</I> gene which is also required for postembryonic development
may play a role in cell &quot;axialisation&quot;. This idea will soon be
put to test as cloning of the <I>MP</I> gene is almost done.
<p>
Two talks addressed the problem of embryo polarity.<A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Norwich/sessions/S26.html" target="_top"> J.Z. Zhang</A> (C. Somerville
lab, Stanford) reported on the <I>twn2</I> mutation which produces twin
embryos. The embryogenic apical daughter cell of the zygote does not divide
but persists on top of a new embryo which is &quot;regenerated&quot; from
the extra-embryogenic basal cell. Surprisingly, the <I>TWN2</I> gene appears
to encode a valyl tRNA synthese-like protein. <A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Norwich/sessions/S28.html" target="_top">G. Juergens</A> (Tuebingen) in
his introductory talk summarised what is known about the <I>GNOM/EMB30</I>
gene and its role in embryogenesis. The 163 kDa gene product shows limited
sequence similarity (&quot;<I>sec7</I> domain&quot;) to the yeast secretory
protein <I>sec7p</I> (Shevell <I>et al.</I>, 1994, Cell <B>77</B>, 1051-1062). More similarity was found to another yeast ORF which is not essential for cell viability in yeast (Busch <I>et al</I>., 1996, Molec. Gen. Genet. <B>250</B>, 681-691). While the primary function of the <I>GN</I> protein is still unclear, a molecular marker for apical development is variably located in <I>gn</I> embryos (Vroemen <I>et al</I>., 1996, Plant Cell <B>8</B>, 783-791).
<p>
Molecular markers would aid in analysing developmental mutants, and two
posters presented studies of promoter trap lines with interesting GUS expression patterns (K. Lindsey lab, Durham, and P. Gallois lab, Perpignan). Another
approach uses the visualisation of the cytoskeleton with tubulin antibodies
(U. Mayer lab, Tuebingen) which may particularly be useful to characterise
morphogenesis (embryo shape) mutants, such as <I>fass, knopf, enano</I>
(R.A. Torres Ruiz lab, Munich), <I>mickey</I> and <I>obelix</I> (Beeckman
<I>et al</I>, Gent/Munich) and cytokinesis mutants, such as <I>keule</I>
(F. Assaad <I>et al</I>., Munich/Tuebingen), <I>cyt1</I> (formerly: <I>emb101</I>; D. Meinke lab, Stillwater OK), and <I>knolle</I>. The <I>KNOLLE</I> gene which encodes a cytokinesis-specific syntaxin-related protein (Lukowitz <I>et al</I>., 1996, Cell <B>84</B>, 61-71) was discussed in more detail by G. Juergens (Tuebingen).
<p>
In conclusion, the study of embryogenesis has become more diverse, still
lacking a unifying conceptual framework. New approaches and unexpected findings
will certainly continue to challenge established views. For example, somatic
embryogenesis may soon become a routine procedure for testing developmental mutants as well as a source of new molecules, such as the somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase (<I>SERK</I>) associated with embryogenic potential (S. De Vries lab, Wageningen).<p>
