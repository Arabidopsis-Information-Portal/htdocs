*Ph. D study position at **Lakehead University, Ontario Province, Canada, 
from January 2011 or May 2011.* 

*In Arabidopsis thaliana, the IRREGULAR XYLEM (IRX) genes are required for 
proper xylem development. Loss of functions of IRX genes, 
glycosyltransferases, causes a collapsed xylem phenotype and decreases 
xylose and cellulose in the cell walls. This results in a mutant plant which 
is much smaller than wild type plant. Some IRX genes are specifically 
expressed in the cells undergoing secondary wall thickening and targets to 
the Golgi, where glucuronoxylan is synthesized. In order to study how those 
genes are involved in xylem development and how it coordinates with other 
related genes, we transformed irx mutant plants with HA/Strep II tagged IRX 
genes under the 35S and native promoters. Overexpression of IRX genes with 
35S promoter did not rescue the phenotype. However the expression of IRX 
genes under the native promoter rescued the mutant phenotype. We need a Ph. 
D student to work on tagged IRX protein complex isolation from rescued 
plants and detect IRX proteins using anti-HA or anti-Strep II antibody by 
Western blot. The isolated IRX protein complexes will be run on 2-D gels and 
subjected to Mass Spectrometry Analysis for identifying interacting proteins 
of IRX. Further protein-protein interaction confirmations and biochemical 
assays may be followed. More experiments will be developed to analyze the 
functions of IRX proteins.
