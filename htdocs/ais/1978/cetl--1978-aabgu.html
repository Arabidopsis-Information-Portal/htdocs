In the last years of Arabidopsis research, attention was drawn to
natural populations. As stressed already by Professor W. Laibach
(1951), flowering time appears to be the most differing and variable
trait of A. thaliana in diffrent natural populations. Napp-Zinn (1964)
showed that differences in the flowering time did not exist only
between population samples but also within them, both between and
within corresponding lines. Ratcliffe (1964, 1965) suggested a
relation between the geographical-climatic position of localities and
the flowering time of ecotypes.<p>

A systematical study of the flowering time variability in Moravian
natural populations was done in our laboratory (Cetl, 1965; Cetl,
Dobrovolna and Effmertova, 1968, 1969). One of the conclusions was
that, at least over the territory studied, the non-random geographical
distribution of natural populations as to the flowering time reflects
adaptation and is genoclinal (Cetl, 1976c). Briefly speaking, late
flowering genotypes are prevailing in dry and warm lowlands while
early flowering genotypes in wet and cold highlands. Evidence was
obtained statistically by means of correlation between the
geographical-climatic characteristics of localities, expressed as
height above sea level and average yearly and monthly temperatures, on
the one hand, and two flowering time indexes, viz., percent of
generative plants during a 42 day experiment, g, and mean number of
days to the apparance of flower primordia in the generative plant
fraction, x (days), on the other. Intentionally chosen experimental
growing conditions (temperture 25*degrees*C, continuous illumination)
were analyzing, allowing to constitute a large scale from very early
to very late flowering genotypes, including those not flowering at
all.<p>

Unfortunately, these considerations were supported by only one measure
of the generative condition of individuals since, indiscriminately,
all plants displaying flower primordia between the 7th and 42nd day
after germination were classified as generative. The other flowering
time index, the mean number of days to the appearance of flower
primordia, was meaningful only in population samples with a large
proportion of generative plants, thus in a part of the whole material.
Here newly compiled data will be given based on a subdivision of the
entire generative plant fraction into separate subfractions. The aim
was to search for those subfractions which gave the highest values of
correlation coefficients with geographical-climatic conditions of
lcoalities and flowering response was not consisdered only from the
view point of its strength but also of its slope, and regession
coefficients were calculated simultaneously with the correlation ones.<p>

Material and Methods<p>

In all the 258 population samples collected from 1963 to 1975 the
total fraction of genertie individuals appearing during a
42-day-experiment was subdivided in two ways: (1) From the appearance
of flower primordia in the earliest plants (7 days) successively to
13, 15, 17, 20, 28 and 42 days, respectively, i.e., into six
"overlapping" subfractions. (2) From 7 to 13, 14 to 20, 21 to 28, and
29 to 42 days, respectively, i.e., into four "alternative"
subfractions.<p>

In calculating correlation and regression coefficients, the height of
localities above sea level was transformed to ln m while the yearly
average temperature given in *degrees*C remained untransformed.<p>

The values of the two geographical-climatic characteristics were taken
as independent variables, the percentage of generative plants in
individual subfractions as a dependent variable. Thus only the
regression of percentage generative plants on the height and
temperature data, respectively, was taken into account.<p>

Results<p>

The data of Figure 1 for the height above sea level and of Figure 2
for the yearly average temperature correspond with each other and
differ only in the sign, the former demonstrating a positive while the
latter a negative correlation and regression. They are, with one
exception which will be shown later, significantly different from zero
at least at P = .01 and in the majority of cases even at P = .001.<p>

In successive "overlapping" subfractions, the correlation and
regression coefficients are increasing gradually from the 7 to 13-day
to the 7 to 28-day subfraction where a numerical maximum was found. A
further increase was not observed.<p>

In successive "alternative" subfractions a numerical maximum was found
at the 14 to 20 day subfraction while in the 29 to 42 day subfraction
the two coefficients eere, in contrast to all the preceding, not
different from zero significantly.<p>

Discussion<p>

In comparison with the results published for the total generative
fraction (7 to 42 days) by Cetl (1976c) where data on 218 populations
samples collected and tested from 1963 to 1974 were summarized, the
correlation coefficients obtained here on more numerous material are
in a good agreement as to sign, magnitude and statistical
significance.<p>

The aspect of subdividing the total fraction of generative genotypes
gave, however, some new information. In "overlapping" subfractions,
enlarging the extent of subfractions beginning from the earliest 7 to
13 day subfraction, the correlation coefficients were permanently
increasing, and the 7 to 28 day subfraction showed maximum values
unanimously. It means that the proportion of genotypes giving floral
primordia in the laboratory experiments between the 7th and 28th day
after emergence is in the closest relation to both the height above
sea level and the average yearly temperature in localities, and that
just this group is the most responsible for the grographical
distribution of populations within the territory. Extending the
subfraction size over 28 days led to no further increase in
correlation coefficients to all suggesting the latest subfraction not
to be meaningful from the point of view of the geographical
distribution. In "alternative" subfractions, the transition from the
earliest 7 to 13 days subfraction to the latest 29 to 42 days
subfraction was connected with an almost intermediate maximum of
correlation coefficients at the 14 to 20 days subfraction. Thus the
proportion of plants showing floral primordia between the 14 and 20th
day has an analogical significance as the 7 to 28 days subfraction
mentioned above. The zero correlation coefficients in the latest 29 to
42 days subfraction are also in agreement with the discussion of
results obtained in the "overlapping" subfractions. The differences of
the regression coefficients in particular subfractions corresponded
well to those of the correlation coefficients demonstrating that not
only the strength but also the slope of the relation studied followed
the same dynamics. The data in Table 1 showed that in the two
subfractions with maximum values of the two coefficients the
percentage of generative plants increased by 48 and 29, respectively,
if the elevation expressed as ln m rose by 1 unit, and decreased by 17
and 7, respectively, if the average yearly temperature rose by 1
*degree*C.<p>

The correlation and regression coefficients were conspicuously higher
in the "overlapping" than in the "alternative" subfractions. This fact
may be connected with the somewhat different size of individual
subfractions as to the number of days: the former subfractions
covered, in average, a larger number of days than the latter (16.5 vs
.9). The differences between the individual population samples played
a minor role in larger subfractions. This consideration leads us to a
statement that the correlation coefficients, although highly
significant statistically, were not too high numerically, and only
their maximum values were as high as .5 resembling a limit of any
practically significant correlation. This fact demonstrates that
certain complications were involved contradicting the general trend
towards the prevalence of late flowering genotypes in the warm
lowlands and of early flowering genotypes in the cold highlands.<p>

Table 1: Regression equations in "overlapping" and "alternative"
subfractions for the percentage of generative genotypes and the height
above sea level of localities (g/ln m), and for the percentage of
generative genotypes and the mean temperature per year in localities
(g/*degrees*C).<p>

Three types of these complications can be given: (1) Some early
flowering population samples showing a high proportion of generative
plants were found in localities with low geographical position and
high temperature and, vice versa, some late flowering population
samples showing low proportion of generative plants in localities with
high geographical position and low temperature, even in the
subfractions giving maximum values of correlation coefficients.
Following examples mostly deviating from the general trend can be
given:<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol15/vol15-pg98-tab1.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

(2) In numerous cases the highland populations displayed a retardation
in flowering compared with populations from medium localities:<p>

In this way similar deviations arose as shown in (1). All subfractions
up to 28 days were affected in the same direction.<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol15/vol15-pg98-tab2.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

(3) While the two georaphical-climatic characteristics of localities
were distributed +/- normally the distribution of population samples
acording to their percentage of generative plants in individual
subfractions was not normal. Under these circumstances, the estimation
of correlation and regression coefficients would be not unambiguous if
strict rules of biometrics were taken into account requiring to have
the two correlated characters distributed normally, Even if this
obstacle were unavoidable under the eperimental pattern used, it might
influence the values of the two coefficients and the conclusions
deduced from them in an undefinable manner.<p>

In spite of the difficulties given, the calculated correlation and
regression coefficients seem to prove that the genoclinal pattern of
the distribution of populations within the height and temperature
gradient studied remained preserved when the total fraction of
generative genotypes was partitioned into separate subfractions. The
maxima in the "overlapping" 7 to 28 days subfraction and in the
"alternative" 14 to 20 days subfraction suggest the proportion of the
medium early genotypes to be the most significant in the genoclinal
distribution. Discussion the consequences of an obvious population x
time interaction it is clear, however, that the role of other early
genotypes cannot be underestimated.<p>

It is difficult to speculate on the causes of above complications.
Considerable deviations from the general trend of geographical
distribution given in (1) might be connected with a downward
migration. All five samples from lowland localities with a high
proportion of generative genotypes were collected on the bank of the
Svratka river southwards of Brno and it may be suspected that they
represent recent colonizations resulting from the seed of highland
populations carried by water or ice. On the Svratka bank near Modrice,
three other population samples (Mod-1, Mod-2, Mod-4) were found with g
= O, 35.4 and 52.0 percent of generative genotypes in the 7 to 28 days
subfraction. These figures, along with the g = 89.5 in Mod-3, might
testify the presence of all possible interstages from "recent" to
"ancient", well adapted populations. The low proportion of generative
genotypes in other five samples from more elevated localities might
also bear upon an upward migration as may be judged from a rather
synanthrop character of populations. In one of the localities given,
TS, a rapid rearrangement in the population took place towards
accumulation of early genotypes in several years following.<p>

A preliminary report on temporal and local changes of the flowering
time in Moravian populations (Cetl, 1977) should be mentioned in this
context. It reports on human influences connected with the destruction
of the present soil surface to be responsible for shifting to early
flowering.<p>

The other source of complications (2) flows from the retardation in
flowering of many highland populations at the initial stages of
laboratory experiments. It is not excluded that this behaviour might
be connected with lower optimum temperature for flowering in those
samples. While temperatures about 25*degrees*C may be optimal in the
samples from medium localities they may be supraoptimal in the samples
from the most elevated localities. One or two examinations of highland
samples showed that they may develop to flowering with the same speed
of those from medium localities if exposed to moderate temperatures of
20 to 25*degrees*C.<p>

The choice of a certain unique set of experimental growing conditions,
although necessary for comparing the results obtained in large series,
may cause similar inevitable complications. General decrease of the
temperature used in laboratory examinations, howeve,r would diminish
the analyzing property of the experimental environment chosen as to
the flowring time variability in large majority of other population
samples.<p>

The third group of complications (3) concerns the lack of normal
distribution of the percentage of generative genotypes in individual
population samples so that the estimation of both correlation and
regression coefficients might be biased. One of the possibilities to
overcome this complication is the choice of nonparametric methods.
For this reason, the estimation of Spearman's correlation
coefficient, rS, was examined in the subfraction 7 to 28 days for g
and ln m; rS was found to be equal to .6148 (without correction for
recurring xi and yi values) or to .6095 (with correction), with P<.01
while r according to Pearson was equal to .5652 +/- .0516. The
differences are slight. Unfortunately, there are no corresponding
estimations of regression coefficients. In each case, the error drawn
from Pearson's correlation coefficients used in the given case is only
low. The problem of the regression coefficients in such a system seems
to be open to further examinations.<p>

A more fundamental problem of the reliability of the statistical
approach to the solution of genecological regularities is emerging
besides that of rather technical problems connected with biometrical
procedures. Advantages as well as disadvantages of this appraoch are
evident. In reality, a causal explanation of the distribution pattern
cannot be replaced by statistical evidence directly and
satisfactorily, and only certain general tendencies may be suggested
by means of a simple correlation and regression analysis. Under
circumstances so happily constituted for both the environmental and
the genetical characteristics of populations expressed numerically,
correlation and regression represent the first and most simple step to
trace the clinal distribution pattern quantitatively.<p>

Partial correlation analysis is to be mentioned as a following step
for detecting causal relations more closely. In order to extend the
investigation in such a direction a higher number of environmental
characters would be necessary. No account was taken of microclimatic,
edaphic and biotic properties of the localities as yet. Many of
evidently important "factors" could not be traced or even expressed
quantitatively. Of course, many of them were carefully recorded in
each locality as, for instance, exposition, slope, soil, and
phytocoenosis. Up to now we were not succeeding in assorting all these
valuable data systematically even if certain suggestions are evident.
Rather small but distinct deviations from the general trend of
distribution were observed when microclimatic differences between
localities were present in the same macroclimatic zone. A clear trend
of deviations related to exposition and slope, hopwever, could not be
specified. The edaphic factor was deciding rather for the presence or
absence of A. thaliana populations than for differences in their
flowering time; soils on limestone rocks and on Carpathian sediments
were found to be unfavourable for Arabidopsis (Ratcliffe, 1965). The
accompanying plant species and the kind of plant cover seem to be very
important; populations from woody phytocoenoses (bushes, forest
margins, clearings and tracks) displayed a shift towards late
flowering compared with those from corresponding open localities
(grassy phytocoenoses or fields). Fine microclimatic differences due
to a higher buffering capacity of woody stands as to temperature
evidently played a significant role. As to human influenced
differences, it would be possible to classify all localities studied
into "natural" in more or less natural grassy or woody phytocoenoses
on one side, and into "synanthrop" in segetal and ruderal
phytocoenoses inclusive of initial stages in naturally or artificially
uncovered areas (Jones, 1968; Kranz, 1976; Paponova, 1977) on the
other, of course with all possible interstages. Our study on temporal
and local changes of the flowering time in Moravian populations (Cetl,
1977) may be mentioned in this respect again. The possibilities of
including all these "factors" into a system of partial correlation
analysis are only to be looked for.<p>

The third step in further investigations should join the present
experimental population genetic approach with the theory of population
genetics. Cetl and Plchova (1975) and Cetl (1976c) outlined some
possibilities to study the genetic structure of A. thaliana
populations by means of behaviour not only of recessive markers in
experimental populations but also of flowering time alleles in natural
populations and their laboratory derivatives. Up to now, however, the
present theoretical models of spatial genetic variation (Felsenstein,
1976) are not ready for such a connection, though they initiate
fruitful ideas about the causal relations in the theoretical
distribution of genes under migration and selection. Above all, it
should be searched for intermediate members in the chain connecting
the theoretical and experimental branch of population genetics in the
problem of clinal distribution.<p>

The theoretical model for one locus (Cetl, 1976a,c) was applied to a
group of natural populations from lowland localities (Cetl, 1976 b,c,)
under certain simplifications. It was shown that frequencies of a +/-
common late and +/- rare early flowering genotypes may be at
equilibrium and that the equilibrium may be connected with balanced
polymorphism. Thus the problem of adaptation and genoclinal
distribution in the system studied seems to be based on two different
but mutually connected mechanisms: (1) on the selection advantage of
late genotypes in the lowland localities, and (2) on the selection
advantage of the heterozygotes leading to the equilibrium in the
condition of balanced polymorphism (Cetl, unpublished).<p>

Figure 3: Correlation coefficients (r, above) and regression
coefficients (bg, in the centre, and bgn, below) in "overlapping"
(left side) and "alternative" subfractions (right side) for the
percentage of generative genotypes in the laboratory experiments (g)
and into the field experiment to the end of the vegetation period (gn)
with standard errors; d - days after emergence.<p>

The ultimate aim of each genecological study is not only to describe
and explain the present state but also to construct hypotheses on its
historical shaping. There are no conclusive data on the origin of the
species A. thaliana. Sometimes, the center is located in Western
Europe (Redei, 1975). Numerous species of the genus Arabidopsis are
distributed in the mountain regions of Central Asia (Yunusov,
Kasyanenko and Usmanov, 1969). In Moravia, lowland populations occur
mainly in "natural" phytocoenoses while the highland populations seem
mainly in the "synanthrop" ones. Thus the highland populations seem to
be rather secondary, and this matter of fact demonstates that the
upward direction of colonization is very probably (Cetl, Manouskova
and Relichova, 1973; Cetl, 1976c) might have served as a resource for
this upward colonization.<p>

The adaptive aspect of the genoclinal distribution of Moravian A.
thaliana populations should be mentioned in this context. According to
our hypothesis (Cetl, Dobrovolna and Effmertova, 1969; Cetl, 1976c)
only late flowering (winter annual) genotypes may survive in the
winter period owing to their ability to remain in the vegetative
condition during the relatively warm autumnal period while early
flowering (summer-annual) genotypes would pass into the generative
condition prematurely, yet before end of the vegetation period and, by
this way, lose their wintering ability. Thus it seems to be useless to
connect maximum adaptation with a definite rather narrow group of
genotypes; searching for a definite threshold appears to be more
adequate.<p>

Effmertova (1967) carried out an outdoor experiment in the
environmental condition corresponding to those of Moravian lowland
localities (Brno) and to the usual period of seed shedding and
germinating (June to October). She showed that genotypes diverged
according to their behaviour in the laboratory experiments: while late
flowering genotypes remained vegetative, early flowering genotypes
became generative to the end of the vegetation period, indeed. Nine
laboratory lines ("races") and twelve population samples covering a
wide range from very early to very late flowering were studied.<p>

The latter part of material allows us to compare the percentage of
generative plants in more or less natural conditions at the end of the
vegetation period with that obtained in different subfractions at
laboratory examinations. In this way it might be recognized at what
number of days to the appearance of flower primordia in our laboratory
experiments the proportion of generative genotypes squares with that
in natural conditions during the autumnal period. This number of days
corresponds then to the threshold which separates the summer annual
from the winter annual genotypes. In searching for this threshold,
correlation and regression coefficients were calculated again. The
strength and slope of the relation between the percentage of
generative genotypes in the field experiment (gn) was measured whereby
both regression coefficients were taken into account (Figure 3). The
maximum values of correlation coefficients occured in the same
subfractions compared with those in Figure 1 and 2, i.e., in the
"overlapping" 7 to 28-days subfraction and in the "alternative" 14 to
20 days subfraction. In these subfractions, the two regression
coefficients were close to 1 suggesting a good mutual agreement of the
proportion of generative plants in the field and laboratory
experiments.<p>

If the question is put of the subfractions of the laboratory
examinations giving the best agreement with the proportion of
genotypes becoming generative durign the autumnal period it can be
answered that it concerns the whole 7 to 28 days subfraction or, in a
more narrow sense, the 14 to 20 days subfraction. If, however, the
question is put of the limit at which the summer-annual genotypes may
be separated from the winter-annual ones according to the laboratory
examinations it can be said that this limit lies at 28 days or, in a
more narrow sense, at 20 days.<p>

This conclusion though drawn from a rather small sample (n=12) may be
generalized for the whole material. As the 21 to 28 days "alternative"
subfraction falls under those whose correlation and regression
coefficients are diminished by retarded flowering of many highland
populations it can be said that in our laboratory experiments the 28th
day after emergence represents a threshold between the group of summer
annuals and that of winter annuals; under environmental conditions of
our lowland localities, all individuals and genotypes appearing flower
primordia up to the 28th day after germination in our laboratory
examinations would become generative during the autumnal period and
decay during the winter period while all others inclusive of those not
flowering to the end of the examinations at all would remain
vegetative and winter successfully.<p>

It is interesting to note that in our laboratory experiments all
genotypes appearing flower primordia 17 days after emergence or later
displayed without exception a distinct vernalization response (Cetl,
unpublished, 1966, 1965). Thus the vernalization requirement of all
genotypes appearing flower primordia in the laboratory between the
17th and 28th day seems to be satisfied naturally in the lowland
localities during the autumnal period, and such a low vernalization
requirement does not prevent the plants from premature passing into
the generative condition. Thus only genotypes possessing a higher
vernalization requirement and appearing flower primorida in the
laboratory later than 28 days after emergence seem to be well
protected in that environment.<p>

Effmertova (1967) suggested a certain relation between late flowering
and the length of the after ripening period of seeds and concluded
that under natural conditions the behaviour of genotype during
autumnal period depends not only from the flowering time determined by
its vernalization (and photoperiodic) response but also by its
after-ripening condition. The same conclusion was stressed once again
by Napp-Zinn (1976) referring to the pioneer papers of Napp-Zinn
(1964) and Ratcliffe (1965) on the mechanisms of adaptation in A.
thaliana. It is clear that a long lasting after ripening period of
seeds may protect a genotype from the premature passing into the
generative condition as effectively as late flowering genes connected
with a considerable vernalization reaction. If selection operates
towards a high wintering ability the two mechanisms are largely
equivalent and mutually replaceable. Unfortunately, only one of these
mechanisms could be studied under accepted experimental pattern.<p>

Germination properties of A. thaliana seeds from natural populations
were thoroughly studied in the meantime (Napp-Zinn, 1975a,b, 1976;
Ratcliffe, 1976). An especially interesting discovery was made by
Ratcliffe (1976) who proved that an efficient store of viable seed may
persist in the soil for several years and secure the survival of a
population. From such a point of view, our experiments carried out
with post dormant seed (3 to 4 months after harvesting) concerned only
the readily disposable part of this reserve. Undoubtedly, the early
germinating fraction participates in the life of a population in a
decisive way while the following fractions may play a significant
role, in the most cases, only secondarily, for instance, under
extremely unfavourable growing and fruiting conditions or under hard
checks into the present plant cover or soil surface.<p>

Nevertheless, each further progress in the field of genecology and
adaptation of A.. thaliana seems only possible when the two adaptive
mechanisms will be studied simultaneously and in mututal relations. It
must be kept in mind that the genetic basis of germination variants
has yet been unknown though some recent studies (Napp-Zinn (1976)
presented during the 2nd International Symposium on Arabidopsis
Research referred still more closely to the problems of the present
communication. The author states explicitly (pg 30) that the
correlations between altitude and flowering time observed in our
Moravian populations did not hold true for the Rhineland populations.
No explanation of the difference was given. Several causes of that
disagreement might be suggested (1) differences in the experimental
technique used, (2) differences in the extent of the material studied,
and (3) differences in the general character of the two trritories
explored. The two latter points seem to be decisive.<p>

It is true that all our considerations about the adaptive basis of the
cline studied concern as yet the lowland part of the Moravian
geographical climatic gradient where the prevalence of late flowering,
winter annual genotypes seem to be satisfactorily explained. As to the
highland of the gradient a hoypothesis was put forward by Cetl,
Dobrovolna and Effmertova (1969). It was supposed that a colder and
shorter autumnal period delays seed ripening and overcoming dormancy.
In conformance with Yunusov, Kasyanenko and Usmanov (1969), the
fruiting period is shifted towards late summer and autumn with
increasing elevation (even if not so drastically as in Tadjikistan),
and this shifting seems to be sufficient to prevent germination,
overcoming dormancy and passing of plants into the generative
condition. The selective disadvantage of last flowering genotypes with
a vernalization requirement in our highland remains obscure.<p>

Summary<p>

Medium early flowering genotypes seem to play a decisive role in the
spatial distribution of A. thaliana populations within the height and
temperature gradient of Moravia where late flowering genotypes prevail
in dry and warm lowlands and early flowering genotypes in wet and cold
highland. Exceptions from the general trend may be ascribed to
migration and to retarded flowering of many highland population
samples under experimental growing conditions. Causal explanation of
A. thaliana genecology should be based on partial correlation analysis
and on the joint approach of experimetnal and theoretical population
genetics. Discussion on the adaptive character of the genoclinal
distribution pattern concerns the flowering time and after ripening
conditions. Only genotypes appearing flower primordia in our
experimental examinations 28 day after emergence and later are shown
to be able to winter successfully under the environmental conditions
of the Moravian lowlands.<p>
