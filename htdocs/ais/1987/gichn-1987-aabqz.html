Investigators studying the potential mutagenicity or antimutagenicity
of sparingly soluble compounds continually face the problem of
selecting appropriate solvents. The water insoluble compounds tested
in mutagenicity assays are mostly dissolved in water miscible organic
solvents. The objective of this presentation is to illustrate the
differential response of two promutagenic nitrosamines - NDMA and NMBA
- and two direct acting mutagenic nitrosamides - MNNG and MNU - to the
presence of four widely used organic solvents: DMSO, acetone, ethanol
and DMF.<p>

Seeds (about 1000) of A. thaliana, race Dijon, were immersed for 3 h
at 25*degrees*C in l ml of the organic solvent mixed with 0.2M
citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 5) or in buffer alone (referred to as
pretreatment) and then for 3 h at 25*degrees*C in 2 ml of the mixture
containing the mutagens and organic solvents (referred to as
treatment). The concentrations of the organic solvents were the same
both in the pretreatment and in the treatment. The pH of the mutagenic
solution was checked at the start of the mutagenic treatment and
during the 3 h treatment did not vary beyond pH 5+/-0.2 (with the
exception of solutions containing DMSO). After treatment, the seeds
were rinsed for 30 min in water and sown on soil in a greenhouse.<p>

For estimating the mutation frequency, the methods developed by Muller
(1963, 1964) were used. Three siliquae from 60 plants, i.e., 180 M 1
siliquae were scored in each treatment (Tab. 1).<p>

Table 1: The effects of organic solvents dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO),
acetone, ethanol and dimethylformamide (DMF) on the mutagenic activity
of promutagenic N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and
N-nitrosomethyulbutylamine (NMBA) and direct acting mutagens
N-methyl-N'nitroN-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) and N-methyl-N-nitrosourea
(MNU) in Arabidopsis thaliana.<p>

The frequency of mutations (i.e. the frequency of segregating M 1
siliquae) induced by the promutagenic nitrosamines NDMA and NMBA, was
markedly reduced in the presence of the organic solvents. The
inhibition of mutagenesis was dose dependent, e.g., 50% DMSO reduced
the frequency of NDMA induced mutations to 8.9%, 25% DMSO to 31.6% and
10% DMSO to 68.9%, compared to 85.6% of mutations after NDMA-treatment
in the absence of DMSO (all data not presented, for details see
Gichner and Veleminsky, 1986).<p>

These results confirm the earlier data demonstrating that organic
solvents inhibit the mutagenicity of promutagenic
N-nitrosodialkylamines in the Salmonella/Ames assay (Yahagi et al.,
1977; Mori et al., 1985). According to latter authors, the
antimutagenic activity of organic solvents is a result of their
interference with the process of metabolic activation of the
promutagens.<p>

The activities of the direct acting mutagens MNNG and MNU were also
significantly reduced in the presence of DMSO. High concentrations of
DMSO, despite the used buffer, elevated the pH of the mutagenic
solution (50% DMSO to pH 7.2 - 7.3) and this increase of pH probably
conditions the "inhibitory" effects of DMSO towards MNNG and MNU
mutagenesis. In contrast, all other solvents (acetone, ethanol, DMF)
enhanced MNNG-mutagenesis. The potentiation of MNNG-mutagenesis was
dose-dependent, e.g., 4% acetone increased the frequency of mutations
to 25%, 8% acetone to 51.7% and 12% acetone to 70.2% compared to 10.6%
of mutations after 0.4 mM MNNG-treatment alone (Gichner and
Veleminsky, 1987).<p>

Unlike MNNG-treatment, the mutagenicity of MNU was only slightly
affected by the presence of organic solvents acetone, ethanol and DMF.<p>

The concentrations of solvents applied did not decrease the
germination of Arabidopsis seeds and had no, or only a negligible,
effect on the frequency of mutations.<p>

CONCLUSION<p>

The organic solvents DMSO, acetone, ethanol and DMF inhibit the
mutagenic activity of the promutagens NDMA and NMBA in A. thaliana.
DMSO further inhibits the mutagenic activity of the direct acting
mutagens MNNG and MNU, probably due to its effect on the pH of the
mutagenic solution. The other organic solvents acetone, ethanol and
DMF markedly potentiate MNNG- mutagenesis, but have only a slight
effect on MNU mutagenesis.<p>

The results emphasize the significance of choosing an appropriate
solvent for testing chemicals for potential mutagenicity of
antimutagenicity and the necessity of including "solvent" controls in
the mutagenicity assay.<p>
