Subject: PhD student and Post-Doc positions open in the Wood Development Group (PI: Ykä Helariutta [Academy Professor]), University of HelsinkiApplicants are searched for two positions: (1)A post doctoral position: An ERC funded project on symplastic communication.  We have recently identified extragenic suppressor mutations for gain-of- function allele of Callose Synthase 3 (CalS3) locus (Vaten et al. Dev Cell 21:1144-55).  We believe these mutations provide an interesting entry point for understanding  how callose regulates cell-to-cell movement of developmental signals through  plasmodesmata. (2) A graduate student position: An Academy of Finland funded project on the role of cytokinin signalling during root vascular development in Arabidopsis. We are investigating how cytokinin regulates procambial development (Mähönen et al. Science 311:94-98; Bishopp et al. Curr Biol 21:917-26). We have identified new components as an entry point both based on genetic screens and microarraysApplicants should send 1) a cover letter describing previous achievements, future career ambitions and motivation for this position; 2) Curriculum vitae with a list of publications and contact information of two referees to email address: yrjo.helariutta-at-helsinki.fi. The deadline for applications is March 10th, 2013. However, the position can be filled earlier if a suitable candidate is found.Please feel free to contact for more information,e-mail: Yrjo.Helariutta-at-helsinki.fiphone:09-19159422http://www.biocenter.helsinki.fi/bi/Helariutta/http://www.helsinki.fi/eng/
