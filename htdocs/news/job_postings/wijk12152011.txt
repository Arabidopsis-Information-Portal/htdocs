  Posted December 2, 2011. I am looking for a postdoc with demonstrated 
  expertise in mass spectrometry-based quantitative phosphoproteomics. 

  Postdoctoral position in Quantitative Phosphoproteomics in Arabidopsis 
  and maize at Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 
  Mass-spectrometry based quantitative phosphoproteomics now allows for 
  the identification and quantification of thousands of phosphopeptides. 
  Consequently, the role of (de)phosphorylation in plant development, 
  metabolism and interactions with the environment can be studied 
  systematically. This project concerns the role of phosphorylation in 
  regulation and integration of metabolism, gene expression and protein 
  homeostasis in maize and Arabidopsis, with an emphasis on plastids. 
  The postdoc will work closely together with plant biologists, 
  geneticists, biochemists and other mass spectrometry experts in the 
  van Wijk lab, as well as bioinformatics collaborators on Cornell 
  University campus. The applicant must have demonstrated experience in 
  mass spectrometry-based quantitative phosphoproteomics (through 
  quality publications) in plants or other biological systems. 
  Experience with plants is not necessary, but would be advantageous. 


  Salaries will be commensurate with experience with generous employee 
  benefits according the Cornell Human Resource Office. 
  Review of applications will begin immediately, and continue until the 
  position is filled. I am looking to fill the position as soon as 
  possible. Application Instructions: Send your curriculum vitae, a 
  statement of research interests and career goals, and three names of 
  references by email to: Klaas J. van Wijk, Department of Plant 
  Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.
