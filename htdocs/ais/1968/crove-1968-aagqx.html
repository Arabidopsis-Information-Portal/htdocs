<h2>The value of numerical taxonomy for Arabidopsis research</h2><p>

This report has two purposes: (1) to summarize relationships among the
strains of the LAIBACH collection of natural races based on
comparative information available; and (2) to make nontaxonomists
aware of the techniques of numerical taxonomy and its possible value
to them.  ROBBELEN (1965) presented comparative data on 12 characters
for 154 lines of 120 strains of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) HEYNH. With
his permission I proceeded to analyze the above data using the
standard techniques of numerical taxonomy (SOKAL and SNEATH, 1963).
Due to space limitations, the reader who is not a numerical taxonomist
may find the following description of the particular technique used to
be too brief.  A complete treatment of the method and explanation of
its terms may be found in the above book.<p>

The data presented by ROBBELEN may be represented as a character (12
rows) by line (154 columns) table.  Call each line an OTU (Operational
Taxonomic Unit - taxon to be classified).  Each character was
standardized to remove the weighting effect due to measurement of the
different characters on different measurement scales.  For example,
the character leaf pubescence had four states while that of leaf width
had only two states.  The fact that different characters have
different numbers of possible states would allow each character to
affect subsequent estimates of similarity differently.  It is this
type of weighting that is removed here. The next step is to calculate
the distance between each OTU in the context of a twelve dimensional
space formed by the twelve characters.  A phenogram, or tree diagram,
is constructed from the calculated distance relations.  SOKALs
distance coefficient was used and the OTU's were clustered into a
phenogram by the Unweighted Pair Group Method, using averages.
Computation required less than two minutes on the CE 625 computer at
the Univeristy of Kansas. &#160;Total computing cost was less than $10.<p>

The results appear in Table 1 and Figure 1.  Because of space
limitations and for other reasons it seemed best to present the
results as a "truncated phenogram", one that showed the relationships
among groups of OTU's, with the members within each group listed in a
table. Truncation was carried out at the distance value of 1.0.  That
is, OTU's clustering with each other at a distance of 1.0 or less were
placed in the same group.  Of course, the advantage of simplicity of
presentation of the results is obtained only by a decrase in the
accuracy of presentation of relationships among individual lines
within a group.  Normally, all OTU's (lines) would be shown separately
in a phenogram. The agreement of the non-truncated phenogram with the
original distance values is estimated by the cophenetic correlation
coefficient, where zero suggests no agreement and one suggests perfect
agreement.  In this analysis the correlation was 0.776.<p>

Twenty-seven clusters of lines (OTU's) of A. thaliana were apparent in
the data.  The study involves too many OTU's to allow an adequate
summary of results in this short report.  However, if one added the
country of origin to each line in Table 1, several groups are found to
consist mostly of lines from one country. But in general the results
do not show a clearcut separation of strains according to their
country of origin and of lines according to their strains. This is the
result of several factors, most of which ROBBELEN (1965, personal
communication) has pointed out.  These include low number of
characters, relatively low sample size used to estimate each character
in each line and the innate plasticity of the vegetative characters
employed.  For these reasons a truncated phenogram was used, because
finer, more accurate resolution among the strains must await increased
observations on a greater number of characters. But the present
analysis still remains an objective summary of the relationships among
lines on the basis of ROBBELENs data. This was its first purpose.<p>

Turning to the second purpose, numerical taxonomy can aid the
geneticist and physiologist by indicating efficiently the
relationships (a) among lines within a strain and (b) between strains
that he, or others are analyzing. For example, assume that we had
obtained a more accurate estimate of phenetic relationships among the
120 strains, say one based on 100 characters.  Investigator A reads
that B, working with strain BLA observed 95% germination of seeds
stored in a certain way for six months as well as several other
interesting characters that were not included in the original 100.
Investigator A works with several other strains and wants to know if
his strains may be likely to possess the same characteristics. By
reference to a phenogram depicting relations among all the strains, A
can assess quickly how closely related phenetically strain BLA is to
any of his strains.  Similarly, suppose A wishes to know why a certain
two strains cluster together, or why a line of one strain clusters
with other strains instead of its own. By examination of the date he
can ascertain in which characters the two OTU's are similar and in
which ones they differ, thus enhancing his understanding of their
relationship.<p>

Genetics and evolutionists may be more interested in a multivariate
character analysis instead of a strain analysis.  One could use the
same methods but instead of a tree diagram of strains, one would have
groups of characters.  The investigator would then be interested to
generate hypotheses as to why certain characters cluster together.  Is
it due to pleitropy, to an adaptive complex, etc.?  Actually, the
above method is relatively inaccurate.  Better results can be obtained
by related methods used in numerical taxonomy that do not result in a
tree diagram, as, for example, principal components analysis (SEAL,
1964).<p>

The above brief discussion cannot give justice to the value of
taximetric techniques as an efficient heuristic procedure to summarize
information and to serve as a context for generating biologically
important hypotheses that can be tested by subsequent experiments.
Its presentation here is chiefly to call attention to a technique of
considerable promise This does not mean that to use it a physiologist
must become a numerical taxonomist. Rather it points to another
direction in which cooperation among biologists of various disciplines
could pay big dividends.  Specifically, a continuing data bank of
information of Arabidopsis strains could be set up and maintained
along the lines used for the maintenance of strains at Gottingen.
Revised reports that incorporate new information both about strain and
character relationships could be issued periodically.  Such a data
bank for over 100 strains of Aedes segypti is being established at
Notre Dame to provide all investigators with as much information as
possible about their strains.  Perhaps a committee should be
established to investigate the feasibility of this for Arabidopsis<p>
