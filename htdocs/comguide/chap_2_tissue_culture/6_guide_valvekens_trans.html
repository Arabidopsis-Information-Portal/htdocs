TRANSFORMATION

*  The protocol described here is mainly intended as a guide for 
newcomers, but I hope that people with expertise in transformation will 
also benefit.  I have tried to stress details, tips, and any pieces of 
information that are important for obtaining transformants.  Some of 
these points come from my own experience, others from Renate 
Schmidt or Caroline Dean.  They, George Coupland and June 
Swinburne have critically read the protocol -- many thanks.

*  Before doing any transformation experiments it is advisable to acquire 
some background on this topic.  The following references are useful 
reading: Lewin, B. 1990. Interaction of Ti plasmid DNA with the plant 
genome.  Genes IV. Oxford Univ. Press. pp744-749; Zambryski, P. 
1988. Basic processes underlying Agrobacterium-mediated DNA 
transfer to plant cells. Ann. Rev. Genet. 22, 1-30; and Valvekens, D., 
Van Montagu, M. and Van Lijsebettens, M. 1988.  Agrobacterium 
tumefaciens- mediated transformation of Arabidopsis thaliana root 
explants by using kanamycin selection. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 
5536-5540.  I am closely following, and unless specified reproducing, 
the original protocol of Valvekens et al.  The Valvekens' protocol, as 
followed in Caroline Dean's lab, appears in this book (Transformation), 
the media and the protocol described here are essentially identical.  
However, there are some differences in the practicalities of the process.  
A variation of Valvekens's protocol, by Nigel Kilby and Ian Furner, also 
appears in this book (Transformation: modification).  It achieves root 
formation in the transformed, regenerated plants, with the aim of moving 
them to soil.  Nevertheless, I find it more convenient to continue the 
transformation process in tissue culture, thereby obtaining sterile seed.

*  If you do not have experience in transformation according to 
Valvekens's protocol, you are advised to work with only one construct 
and not to embark on a large scale experiment.  When the method is 
working, try to obtain all the independent transformants you need with a 
particular construct from the same experiment.  If a few constructs (up to 
four) are to be introduced separately into Arabidopsis, then it is 
advantageous to carry out the transformations concurrently.  In this case, 
handling of plates, pots and so on is greatly facilitated by assigning one 
colour to each construct.  It is very helpful to write a list including: the 
number of the individual transformed callus, date when it is moved to 
GM, date when it is moved to a pot, date of collection of seed, and 
remarks.

*  I emphasise that I have used this protocol for transforming A. thaliana 
Landsberg erecta, using Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58C1 containing 
the plasmid pGV2260.  Variations in growth times, regeneration 
efficiencies and so on can be expected with other strains.

1.  MEDIA, ANTIBIOTICS & HORMONES
  (i) GM AGAR
 *  Use Difco Bacto Agar.  It is advisable to store 1 litre conical lasks with 
0.5 l of GM agar in the  cold room.  When you need the agar, melt it in the 
microwave oven.

  (ii) CIM
 *  Prepare IM  1l-1
Gamborg B5 salts  3.84 g
Glucose 20.0 g
MES 17 g/102 ml pH 5.7  3.0 ml
Distilled H2O  up to 1l
 *  Dissolve all the components with a magnetic stirrer and place the 
solution in 400 ml bottles.   Autoclave and store them in the cold room.  
When you need CIM, add the hormones:

2,4-D@5.0 mgml-1 100 ugl-1
Kinetin@0.5 mgml-1 100 ugl-1

  (iii) CIM-AGAR
 *  Prepare IM + gel rite agar 0.25%.  It is advisable not to put more than 
0.5l of medium in a  single flask (of 1 l).  Otherwise the flask becomes too 
heavy for pouring the medium properly.   Autoclave, cool down to 
~45oC, add the hormones and pour the medium on petri dishes.  In  my 
experience, gel rite gives better callus regeneration than Bacto Agar.

  (iv) PREPARATION OF ANTIBIOTIC STOCK SOLUTIONS
 *  All in sterile distilled water.

VANCOMYCIN@100 mgml-1
In the flow hood, add 5 ml of sterile distilled water to the vial containing 
500 mg.  Shake and use.  Leave any remaining solution in the original 
vial on ice and store it at -20oC as soon as possible until next used.

AUGMENTIN@50 mgml-1
Weigh the right amount into a weighing boat.  In the flow hood, add 
sterile water, and filter sterilise using an Acrodisk.  You can filter pouring 
the solution in the flask with the medium, or in a tube.  Never leave the 
augmentin stock solution on ice or freeze it.  It will go off (becomes 
brown).

KANAMYCIN MONOSULFATE@50 mgml-1
Prepare a few ml.  Sterilise through an Acrodisk and make aliquots of 50 
ul in the flow hood.

  (v) PREPARATION OF HORMONE STOCK SOLUTIONS
 *  Hormones are the most important factor for good regeneration of 
transformed root cells.   Take all necessary precautions to ensure proper 
preparation and handling of your stock  solutions.  Use high quality 
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as the solvent.  Sigma supplies it in 5  or 10 
ml aliquots in ampoules (Catalogue No. d 2650).  Once open, use the 
whole contents of  the ampoule.  It is advisable to weigh at least 5 mg of 
any hormone in order to minimise errors.
 Concentrations of stock solutions:
For CIM For SIM
2,4-D@5 mgml-1 2-iP@5 mgml-1
Kinetin@0.5 mgml-1 IAA@1.5 mgml-1

 *  Once you have prepared the stock solution, make aliquots of 55 ul, 
except for the 2-iP,  where they should be of 550 ul.  Store them at -
20oC for up to two months.  Once an aliquot  has been thawed, use the 
right volume and discard the rest. Never reuse remaining stock  
solutions.
  (vi) SIM AGAR (with and without antibiotics)
 *  The amounts of hormones and antibiotics given are for 0.5 l.

  (i) Do exactly the same as if you were preparing CIM-agar.  However, 
when adding the hormones, add:
2-iP@5.0 mgml-1 500 ul
IAA@1.5 mgml-1  50 ul
  (ii) Antibiotics added to the plates to be used in the first two weeks after 
having washed the explants:
Vancomycin@100 mgml-1 3.75 ml
Augmentin@50 mgml-1 2.0 ml
 *  Augmentin is probably not necessary when the Agrobacterium strain 
is kanamycin sensitive  (C58C1 is kanS).  In this case, both vancomycin 
and kanamycin act upon agrobacteria.   However, if you infect with a 
strain that is kanamycin resistant, add augmentin because  vancomycin 
alone is likely to result in agrobacteria taking over.

  (iii) Prepare 2 plates (aiming for ~25 mlplate-1), to be used for the + 
regeneration control (1 for each week).  To the rest of the medium, add:
Kanamycin monosulfate@50 mgml-1 47.5 ul
  (iv) Plates for the following weeks:  decrease by 1/3 the concentration 
of vancomycin, adding 2.5 ml0.5 l-1, and omit augmentin.
 *  I prepare sets of plates for two weeks at a time.  After having poured 
the medium, leave the  lids open for ~20 minutes and, once the medium 
has set, place the plates in the original plastic  bags and store them in the 
cold room.  Always keep the plates horizontal as gel rite is "soft" and  
your plates can be ruined if you incline or invert them.

2.  SOWING THE SEED
 *  To obtain high quality roots, sow ~100 seeds/GM agar plate, leaving 
the seed evenly  distributed.

  (i) You can sprinkle the seed on the medium (separate any clumps of 
seed).  However, I sow the seed one by one, using forceps, with a 
template underneath (it only takes about 10 min per plate).  Four plates 
with seedlings/construct may be enough to obtain 10-30 independent 
transformants.  Use deep petri dishes (e.g., Falcon 3003, 20 mm deep), 
which allow better growth of the seedlings than conventional ones and,  
are, therefore, likely to improve the quality of the roots. 
  (ii) Place the plates at 4oC for 4 d, to break seed dormancy.  Then move 
the plates to a growth room.  After 2-3 weeks, condensation can appear 
on the inner side of the lid.  Try to avoid this by placing two short pieces 
of Micropore 3M tape vertically on opposite sides of the plate (instead of 
one long piece horizontally).  This allows better gas exchange (Renate 
Schmidt, pers. comm.) and helps to keep the inside of the plate less 
moist.  On the other hand, you can always remove the tape occasionally 
and dry the lid with sterile filter paper.
 *  It is advisable to sow seed on a few plates every week, thereby 
providing a constant supply of  roots, until you are confident that the 
transformation experiment has worked.  This will save you  a lot of time if 
you have to repeat a transformation.


3.  ROOT PREPARATION
 *  The best time for preparing roots is after an incubation period of 
approximately four weeks in  the growth room.  Use the plates when the 
plantlets have not yet started to bolt, the roots are  white, and the 
medium is not too dry.  Discard old plates, as the efficiency of 
transformation is  likely to drop substantially.
  (i) Remove all the aerial part of the seedlings, taking groups of a few 
stems with forceps and cutting them out, at the medium surface, with a 
scalpel.  Then completely remove any leaves or aerial parts still 
remaining.  Add 15-20 ml of CIM.  Mix it gently with the medium, and pull 
the roots out with forceps.  Sometimes it is possible to take all the roots 
together, as a large root mass, instead of the roots of individual plants.  If 
possible, do it this way because it is quicker.
  (ii) Transfer the roots to a petri dish containing ~25 ml of CIM to wash the 
roots.  Remove the original medium as much as possible, but try not to 
damage the roots.  Repeat this step.  Make 3-5 bunches of roots and 
place them on the surface of a CIM-agar plate.  Spread the roots with 
forceps and a spatula, so that they occupy a larger area and are in close 
contact with the medium, but without burying them. Remove the excess 
liquid with a Gilson pipette.  Leave the surface of the plate dry, in order to 
prevent hormone dilution.  Seal the plates with 3M tape and leave them 
for 3 d in the growth room.  Use one CIM agar plate per GM with 
seedlings plate.

4.  ROOT EXPLANT PREPARATION
 *  Before you start, check the roots carefully for contamination (see 
Transformation).  If you  discover any, either discard that plate or if it is 
localised to a single spot, use the roots which are  furthest from the 
contamination.

  (i) Take individual bunches of roots and transfer them to an empty petri 
dish.  Cut them first longitudinally, making root strips ~0.5 cm wide.  After 
this, cut the roots perpendicularly, every ~0.5 cm.  To make the actual 
root explants, 2 or 3 of these root pieces may be necessary.  An average 
of 30-40 root explants can be obtained from each CIM agar plate with 
roots.  Use a fresh empty petri dish per CIM agar plate with roots.

5.  INFECTION OF ROOT EXPLANTS
 *  Always include the appropriate antibiotics in Agrobacterium cultures. 
Also make sure you  already have a recent culture before obtaining the 
roots.  24-36 h. before the infection of root  explants, start a 5-10 ml 
Agrobacterium culture by inoculating with 50-100 ul of a recent  
saturated culture.  Once the final culture is saturated, keep it always at r.t. 
until infecting the  roots.  Storage of cultures at low temperatures results 
in poor transformation efficiency.

 *  It is wise to remove the antibiotics before infecting the root explants.  
To this end, spin the  cells down and resuspend them in the original 
volume of fresh YEP.  You can use an  Eppendorf tube with 1 ml of 
culture (keep the conditions sterile).

  (i) Transfer 1 ml of cell suspension into 20-25 ml of CIM in a petri dish.  
Soak the root explants for 2-10 min, trying not to disrupt them.  Longer 
times could be detrimental as Agrobacterium is toxic to plant cells.  
Transfer the root explants to a sheet of sterile filter paper 8.5 cm in 
diameter (place the filter on an upside down lid of a petri dish).  Take one 
explant, dry it incompletely on 2-3 stacked sheets of fresh filter paper 
and place it on the CIM-agar plate.  Do the same with the remaining 
explants without overdrying them.  Use 2 CIM agar plates per original 
petri dish of roots, thus placing 15-20 infected root explants per CIM-
agar plate.

 *  Make sure the agrobacteria in CIM do not sediment, by shaking the 
plate before transferring  each set of root explants.  This will facilitate a 
more uniform infection of the roots.

6.  CO-CULTURE OF THE ROOT EXPLANTS WITH AGROBACTERIUM
 *  In my opinion, after 2 d incubation in the growth room the presence of 
agrobacteria must be  evident.  Each root explant should be contained in 
a slightly whitish area.  If this is not the  case, prolong the culture for up
to 24 h.  This should allow for enough time to have a good  agrobacterial
growth.  If you are uncertain of what to do, you can always wash the explants in
 two sets, allowing different co-culture times. 

 *  On the other hand, other people with experience in transformation 
believe that  Agrobacterium growth must not be evident.  If it is, the same 
plant cell can be transformed  several times, thus carrying the construct 
in more than one locus. However, around 70% of my  transformants 
have single locus insertions.

 *  If the growth of agrobacteria is insufficient, there will be very few 
transformation events,  resulting in too few green calli.  On the other 
hand, agrobacteria overgrowth can produce  several transformants per 
root explant, leading to several, very close green calli in most root  
explants.  This makes it difficult to distinguish between individual 
regenerating calli and even  chimaeric regenerating plants can be 
formed, coming from different transformation events.  If  the agrobacteria 
overgrowth is very severe, root cells can be killed and no transformants 
will be  obtained.  Both extremes are, therefore, undesirable.  Aim for an 
average of 1-2 regenerating  calli per root explant.

 *  It is also possible to infect the cut roots and make the explants 
afterwards (see  Transformation).

7.  WASHING THE ROOT EXPLANTS
 *  In Valvekens's protocol, washes are done in CIM + vancomycin.  
However, vancomycin is very expensive and can be omited (see 
Transformation).

 *  You will need several plates with 25-30 ml of CIM (SIM can also be 
used), hereafter called A, B, and so on.  In addition you will need a "root 
collector."  This is a portion of metalic sieve (a triangle of approx. 2 
cm/side) in which a long, thin spatula has been inserted.  Sterilise it by 
autoclaving or by immersion in 90% ethanol.  Do not flame it as this will 
damage the sieve.

  (i) Wash together the 15-20 infected root explants contained on the 
same CIM-agar plate.  Transfer them to plate A and separate them 
thorougly using forceps so that the roots are properly washed.  Transfer 
the roots to plate B.  Collect the remaining roots in plate A with the root 
collector and transfer them to plate B (with forceps).  Wash the roots in 
plate B as before and transfer them with forceps to plate C placing them 
in 15-20 groups.  Collect the remaining roots in plate B and add them to 
a few of those groups of roots.  Transfer the clumps of roots to three 
stacked sheets of Whatman No.1 filter paper, 8.5 cm in diameter, and 
allow them to dry.  Collect the remaining roots in plate C and add them to 
a few of the drying root clumps.  Following this procedure, the roots are 
properly washed.  This avoids the possibility of agrobacteria taking over 
in the SIM agar plates.  Incidentally, if this happens it is very difficult to
get rid of the agrobacteria and your chances of successful transformation are
very low. 
  (ii) Transfer the reconstituted root explants to SIM agar plates 
containing the appropriate antibiotics and leave the plates in the growth 
room.  It is advisable not to reuse any of plates A, B or C for further 
washes.  In additon, the root collector should be sterilsed, by immersion 
in 90% ethanol, after washing each set of explants coming from the 
same initial CIM agar plate.  This will avoid a general contamination if there 
was a previous one, which had been masked by growth of 
Agrobacterium.
 *  Hormones (especially IAA) and antibiotics are likely to lose activity after 
several days in the  growth room.  From now on, transfer your root 
explants into fresh SIM agar plates weekly.  Five  to 6 weeks after the 
washes, discard your root explants.  You are likely to obtain only a few  
more regenerating shoots.

8.  HANDLING OF THE REGENERATING CALLI
 *  After approximately 3 weeks, green calli will be regenerating into 
shoots-leaves (hereafter  called regenerating shoots).  Wait until they 
form a structure of ~5-8 mm in length, because  regenerating shoots that 
are too small tend to die in GM.  However, do not leave the  regenerating 
shoots in SIM agar for too long as they may show poorer regeneration or 
even  die.  Cut the regenerating shoot at its base, removing callus as 
much as possible, and transfer it  to a GM agar plate.  Deep plates are 
better, as they allow more space for the regenerating shoot  to grow and 
bolt.  Deep plates are, however, 4 times the price of conventional plates.  
You can  place up to 10-12 regenerating shoots per plate.

 *  From now on, regeneration continues with neither kanamycin 
selection nor plant hormones  in the medium.  Number each 
regenerating callus that you transfer to GM and, obviously, give  the 
same number to anything developing from that callus.  Check your SIM 
agar plates every  few days; more regenerating shoots will appear.  
Transfer as many regenerating shoots as  possible to GM.  You are likely 
to lose plants at every stage.

 *  When the regenerating callus produces many "leaves" but does not 
bolt, keep teasing the  material apart, maintaining the meristem(s) until 
the plant normalises and forms a proper  rosette.

9.  HANDLING OF THE REGENERATING TRANSFORMED PLANTS
 *  Be extremely careful with serrated forceps and any metal instruments 
with grooves.  Normal  sterilisation with ethanol and flaming is sometimes 
not enough to ensure sterility.  The best  system is to wash thoroughly 
the serrated area with a cleaning brush, using detergent, and  proceed 
normally afterwards.  Autoclaving of instruments is equally effective, but 
it is better to  use them clean.

 *  Bear in mind that not all regenerating plants in Magentas set seed and 
you can lose some of  them as a result of contamination.  It is therefore 
advisable to have 2-3 regenerating plants from  the same callus (Renate 
Schmidt, pers. comm.).

 *  When the regenerating shoot is bolting, it has to be transferred to a 
pot with GM.  Do it  quickly, as a delay of a few days can mean that it goes 
back to a callus-like shape.  Put the  regenerating shoot on an empty 
petri dish.  Sometimes two or more regenerating plantlets  develop from 
the original regenerating shoot and only one of them is actually bolting.  
In this  case, carefully separate them and transfer the non-bolting ones 
into a GM agar plate.  Remove  any callus or dead leaves at the base of 
the regenerating shoot.  If necessary, cut healthy  leaves out so that the 
base of the bolting shoot can be introduced into the GM medium.   
Transfer it to a pot (Magentas are the best in my experience, but some 
people like cylindrical  pots).  Keep the pot closed.  If you lift the lid at
this stage, the plant is likely to wilt and die.  If  more regenerating plants
coming from the same callus bolt, transfer them into pots (up to 3 per
independent transformant). 

 *  Sometimes, rosette leaves lift and detach the base of the plant from 
the medium.  Obviously,  if this happens, push the plant into the medium 
and if necessary, remove some of the leaves  first.

 *  Quite often a regenerating plant in a pot is actually composed of 
several regenerating plants  kept together.  You can separate them (in a 
15 cm empty petri dish) and obtain 2-3 plants from  the same 
transformant.  These should be placed in different pots.  However, be 
very careful  when manipulating plants in sterile conditions.  The more 
that you take them out of the pot or  the petri dish, the more likely they 
are to become contaminated.

 *  If the bottom of the plant has formed a mass of callus, this often results 
in poor growth, pale  colour and no seed formation.  It is usually 
necesssary to remove this callus.  To this end,  transfer the plant to a 15 
cm empty petri dish (only if the plant is relatively small can  conventional 
petri dishes be used) and carefully remove the callus and any dead or 
wilted  leaves.  If the plant is big and has many pale stems, prune it, 
leaving only a few healthy stems.   After this, place the plant in a fresh pot 
(you can also use the original one, putting the plant in a  different place).  
This callus formation is usually associated with moist medium.  Use dry  
Magentas and keep an eye on the humidity of the medium throughout 
the time in which the  plants are in them.

 *  When the medium in the pot becomes contaminated it is sometimes 
possible to save the  plant.  If the contamination has  not reached the 
plant move it immediately into a fresh pot.  If  the contamination has 
reached the plant, cut the stem and move the upper, uncontaminated  
part into a fresh pot.

 *  Closed magentas can be too humid inside and this prevents 
pollination, thus resulting in no  seed set (see Transformation).  To avoid 
this, when the flowers reach the lid, lift it and seal with  3M tape.  During 
the next days, check for any wilting.  If this occurs, close the lid as 
before.  In  some cases it is possible to obtain seed in closed Magentas.  
However, as a general rule,  proceed according to this protocol.

10.  HARVESTING AND SOWING THE SEED FROM ORIGINAL 
TRANSFORMANTS
 *   Also in sterile conditions!

 *  If you have several plants from the same transformed callus (that 
should be in different pots),  always collect their seeds separately.  Sow 
seed from only one of these plants.  Although the  other plants are 
expected to be genetically identical, they could exceptionally be from a  
different transformant.

  (i) When the pods are yellow-brown (still closed) cut the stems and 
place them in an empty petri dish.  Before sowing the seed allow them to 
dry for a few days.
 *  The first thing you must do once you have obtained seed from your 
putatively transformed  plants is to check that they segregate KanR 
individuals, and, if so, determine the segregation  ratio, which is 
indicative of how many loci harbour the construct.

  (ii) Sow ~100 seed on a petri dish containing GM agar + kanamycin 50 
ugml-1.  Before sowing the seed, they have to be separated from their 
pods and the dry stems and pods removed.  At this stage, hold the petri 
dish containing the seed above the medium.  Flick it, so that the seed fall 
on the medium, and separate any clumps.
 *  This is a quick system but it has the following disadvantages: 
(a)  It is easy to lose seed when separating it from the pods and when 
sowing it.  You should not lose any transformed seed into the 
environment.
(b)  You can contaminate the medium when manipulating the petri dish 
above it.
(c)  The seed can end up unevenly distributed on the medium. 
(d)  Due to static electricity, some of the seed remain in the petri dish.
 A variation of this method for sowing the seed is described below.  It 
takes longer, but  overcomes (or improves substantially) the drawbacks 
stated above.

  (iii) Before collecting your seed, place a sterile Whatman No.1 filter 
paper, 8.5 cm in diameter, in a 9 cm petri dish placed upside-down.  Cut 
the stems containing the pods and place them in the petri dish as 
explained above.  If necessary, allow the seed to dry.  Just before 
sowing the seed, add ~2 ml of sterile water and carefully open the pods, 
using a long spatula and holding the base of the petri dish as if it were 
the lid.  The seed will stay on the wet filter paper.  Then, using a template 
underneath, sow the seed one by one using forceps.  If there are some 
seed left, allow the filter paper to dry out in the flow hood, seal the plate 
with 3M tape (all around) and store it.  If you want to sow seed again, add 
sterile water and proceed as explained above.

11.  EFFICIENCIES THROUGHOUT THE PLANT TRANSFORMATION 
PROCESS
 *  It is difficult to make an estimate of the proportion of individuals that
will pass to the next step.   It can vary a great deal and depends on many
factors, among them the construct with which you  have transformed.  I have used
kanamycin as the selectable marker for Landsberg erecta.  My constructs were
cloned into the vectors p0188 and p13019 (Caroline Dean, unpublished) and 
introduced in Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58C1 carrying the plasmid pGV2260,
which  contains the vir genes.  In these conditions, not accounting for any
losses due to  contamination, a rough estimate would be: 
(a)  Green calli that regenerate into shoots 60%
(b)  Regenerating shoots that actually bolt 70% 
(c)  Bolting shoots that develop into a mature plant 80%
(d)  Mature plants that set seed  50%.
As stated before, it is possible to improve (d) by having 2 or 3 plants 
coming from the same callus.  Quite often, for unknown reasons, one of 
these plants sets seed while the other(s) do not.
