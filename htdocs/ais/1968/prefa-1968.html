<h2>PREFACE</h2><p>

G. ROEBBELEN<p>

It is just 5 years, that on the occasion of the XIth International
Congress of Genetics in Scheveningen an informal meeting was held,
during which some cooperation of Arabidopsis research workers was
suggested.  It also appeared worthwhile to have new results and
experiences in Arabidopsis research quickly circulated among the
interested scientists. Thus this newsletter was proposed, of which the
present 5 issues surely do not yet justify a jubilee edition. But the
increasing interest in this "tachyplant" was followed by an increasing
number of subscribers of the "Arabidopsis Information Service" and the
first issues were soon out of print. The following articles are
therefore intended to discuss the use of this plant from a more
general point of view.  A comprehensive list of literature was added,
which will best be suited to place the existing information on
Arabidopsis in the various fields of biology at everyones easy
disposal.<p>
