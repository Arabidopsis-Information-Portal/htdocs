to study early endosperm development in Arabidopsis and maize. 
 
We are looking for a highly motivated individual with a Ph.D. degree and 
with demonstrated ability to carry out outstanding research in the fields of 
plant biology, genetics, or related disciplines.  Proven experience with 
molecular biology techniques and demonstrated skills in written and oral 
communication are essential qualifications.  Ability to interact and work 
collaboratively with others is also critical as this is a collaborative 
effort involving multiple laboratories.  Previous experience with 
Arabidopsis, maize or knowledge of functional genomics and/or bioinformatics 
is desirable but not essential. Position is available immediately.
