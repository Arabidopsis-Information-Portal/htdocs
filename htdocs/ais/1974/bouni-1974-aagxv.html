Previous work gave evidence to the role of L-leucine on the greening
of Arabidopsis and barley leaves, both in chlorophyll mutants and
control plants (BABADZHANOVA et al. 1971, BOUNIAS 1972a). Moreover,
L-(U)-14C-leucine is easily incorporated into different metabolic
compounds, such as sugars, amino acids, chlorophylls and carotenoids
(FALUDI-DANIEL 1969, BOUNIAS 1973).<p>

These results led us to study the sites of incorporation of
L-(U)-14C-leucine into Arabidopsis and barley leaves.<p>

Methods<p>

Plants were grown aseptically in tubes on sand and liquid mineral
medium.  L-(U)-14C-leucine was given to the roots during 5 hours, just
before tissue fixation. The specific activity of 14C-leucine was 500
micro-Ci/m.mole and its concentration in the medium 5 mM. The leaves
were then cut off and either fixed in cooled acetone or directly
included by the "freeze drying" technique.<p>

The plates were coated with ILFORD G5 or L4 emulsion (6 micro
thickness) and kept for exposition during 2 months. Biochemical
analysis showed that the radio-activity observed was actually due to
L-leucine, other amino acids being only slightly marked in the
experimental conditions.<p>

Individual chloroplasts have been separated from the other
cell-constituents using a sedimentation technique in non-polar
solvents: with a gradient mixture of petroleum-spirit + carbon
tetrachloride, pure chloroplasts are isolated at a density of 1.42.<p>

In both Arabidopsis and barley cells, L-(U)-14C-leucine is mainly
located in chloroplastic grana: Fig. 1a shows leucine localizations in
Arabidopsis cells, with the presence of leucine into the chloroplasts
and on peripheric sites. Fig 1b shows the same results at a higher
magnification on individual chloroplasts isolated by the gradient
sedimentation technique.<p>

phosphatase activity (E.C.3.1.3.1.) in Arabidopsis and barley leaves.<p>

These first experiments have shown an intresting similarity between
Arabidopsis and barley, for the chloroplastic localization of L-14C
leucine, and we know that L-leucine is able to increae or decrease the
photosynthetic-pigment content of Arabidopsis according to its
concentration and that in mutants with low level of leucine, the
alkaline phosphatase activity is significantly increased (BOUNIAS,
leaves, as in barley, alkaline phosphatase activity should be largely
located in chloroplasts: This is a call for
Arabidopsis-histo-chemists' investigations!<p>

Summary:<p>

L-(U)-14C-leucine incorporated into Arabidopsis and barley cells is
mainly localized in chloroplastic sites, as internal and peripheric
grana.  Experiments in barley have shown a similar localization for
alkaline posphatase activity which could explain the role of L-leucine
on this enzyme. A hypothesis is thus expressed for the chloroplastic
localization of alkaline phosphatase in Arabidopsis.<p>

Resume:<p>

La L-leucine-(U)-14C incorporee dans les cellules d'Arabidopsis et
d'orge est essentiellement localisee au niveau des chloroplastes sous
forme de grana intre et perio chloroplastiques. Des experiences
realisees chez l'orge ont montre une localisation de meme type pour
l'activite phosphatasique alcaline, ce qui pourrait xpliquer le role
regulator de la leucine a l'egard de cette enzyme.  On emet alors
l'hypothese d'une localisation egalement chloroplastique de la
phosphatase chez Arabidopsis.<p>
