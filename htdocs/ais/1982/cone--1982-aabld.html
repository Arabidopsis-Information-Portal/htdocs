INTRODUCTION<p>

In the present paper the escape time of the photocontrol by
phytochrome of seed germination in different batches of A. thaliana
was investigated. The escape time is defined as the dark period
between an inductive red pulse or irradiation after which short
far-red no longer reverses the effect of the red irradiation. In other
words it represents the time course of Pfr (far-red absorbing form of
phytochrome) action. Experiments to investigate the escape time have
been determined with lettuce seed (Borthwick et al., 1954; Gwynn and
Scheibe, 1972). The time at which 50% of the seeds escaped from
far-red control varies from 4 to 9 h. Bewley et al. (1968) showed that
the duration of Pfr action, necessary for germination of lettuce seed,
can be reduced to a few minutes by adding gibberellic acid at a
concentration which itself had no influence on germination. The
interaction between Pfr and gibberellins is synergistic.<p>

MATERIAL AND METHODS<p>

Two different batches of wild type A. thaliana seeds were used. A
batch, harvested in winter 1981 (WT '81), which is referred to as
slightly dormant, and a batch harvested in late summer 1979 (WT '79),
which is more heavily dormant. Also a mutant (ttg) (Koornneef, 1981)
of medium depth dormancy was used. The seeds were imbibed in lots of
50 to 100 small petri dishes on 5 layers of 4.5 cm diameter
filterpaper disks (Schleicher & Scholl, nr. 589 2), moistened with 1.5
ml solution containing 0.01 M Na-K-phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) and 0.001
M KNO 3. The dishes were kept in the dark during the imbibition period
of 7 days at 7*degrees*C. Before irradiation the dishes were kept for
1 h at 20*degrees*C. Red irradiation was done with a saturating
fluence of 1,2000 JmE-2, *lambda* max 660 nm, half band with 7.1 nm,
obtained by an interference filter and quartz iodine slide projector.
Saturating far-red fluence was 1,800 JmE-2, *lambda*max 730 nm and half
band with 9.5 nm. Germination was determined after an additional
incubation in the dark at 20*degrees*C for 4 days. Three dishes were
used for each treatment and results are expressed as % germination +/-
standard error of the mean.<p>

RESULTS<p>

Figure 1 shows the curves for the rate of escape of germination from
phytochrome control at 20*degrees*C. The horizontal axis shows the
dark period between red and far-red irradiation.<p>

With a saturating fluence of red light, germination reached 100% in
all seed batches. The dark germination in the batches WT '79 and ttg
was nearly zero and in WT '81 it was 50%. A saturating fluence of
far-red light stimulated the germination in WT '81 to 70% and in ttg
to 20%. This means that the batches WT '81 and ttg are very sensitive
to Pfr. The very low level of Pfr which is established by far-red
light of 730 nm is apparently enough to stimulate germination of some
of the seeds in the population. The batch WT '79 is very much less
sensitive to Pfr.<p>

Table 1 shows the times by which 50% of the seeds escaped from far-red
photocontrol and the fluence of red light (660 nm) needed to reach 50%
of the maximal response to red light.<p>

CONCLUSION<p>

The very fast escape of WT '81 from reversibility by far-red light
suggests that before irradiation with red light the low level of Pfr,
already present in the seeds, has initiated significant phytochrome
action. Consequently a very small fluence of red light is needed to
reach 100% germination.<p>

The very slow escape of WT '79 suggests that before irradiation little
or no Pfr was in the seeds and a greater fluence of red light is
needed to reach 100% germination. On the other hand both could have
the same Pfr level but one batch be more sensitive than the other to
Pfr. Bewley et al., (1968) showed that the rate of escape could be
increased by bypassing the Pfr action with gibberellins. This agrees
with the idea that it is the amount of Pfr and the time that Pfr acts,
that determines the rate of escape from photocontrol. Waddoups (1976)
also reported that decreased dormancy increases the rate of escape of
reversibility in Sinapsis arvensis seeds.<p>

The escape times and fluence necessary for 50% germination in
Arabidopsis confirm that the rate of escape of reversibility by
far-red light is not a constant phenomenon, but is correlated with the
degree of dormancy of the seeds, which in turn appears to be related
to the sensitivity of the seeds to Pfr.<p>
