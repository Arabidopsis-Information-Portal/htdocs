The aim of this contribution is to study two types of variability
evolving in this genus:<p>

i) Spontaneous variability in natural populations which is canalized
to high ecotypic adaptation in the habitat by natural selection, and<p>

ii) induced variability in mutant lines depending on the experimetnal
conditions which scientists have introduced and therefore on human
selection.<p>

1.  Inter- and intra specific variations.<p>

I would like to consider the inter- and intraspecific variability of
Arabidopsis.  Natural populations of the species in this genus show
significant variations with respect to,<p>

i) morphological characters (CROVELLO, 1968; USMANOV, 1976)<p>

ii) ecological adaptation (RATCLIFFE, 1976; NAPP-ZINN, 1964)<p>

iii) enzymatical polymophism (JACOBS, 1971; GROVER, 1975)<p>

iv) chromosomal number (MESICECK, 1967; IVANOV, 1974), and<p>

v) genetic structure (CETL et al., 1975; WU, 1974).<p>

The samples of various proveniences of Arabidopsis thaliana were
classified with respect to 7 shoot characters and the flowering time
by use of computerized, numerical taxonomy. Although these characters
are mostly different between populations (about 150 populations were
grouped into 27 sections), but no correlation to distinct ecological
factors or to geographical distribution could be found.  CROVELLO was
interested in generating a hypothesis on the clustering of such
morphological characters; however, he could not answer the question,
is it due to genetic pleiotropy and/or to an ecological adaptive
complex.<p>

various ecological conditions. The populations are adapted to rather
specific ranges of different temperature, precipitation, latitude,
altitude above sea level, soil, and more or less human controlled
habitats.<p>

Figure 2: Distribution of flowering time differences in natural
populations of A. thaliana. The experimental conditions (74-10/1,2)
were the following: Germination under long day conditions (16h/d) in a
glasshouse (20*degrees*C) for 2 weeks, Then two inductive treatments
of different photoperiod and vernalization were applied, sd = short
day (8h/day) plus low temperature (3 to 5*degrees*C), ld = long day
(16h/day) plus high temperature (20*degrees*C).  Afterwards all the
plants were growing under the long day and high temperature
conditions. Three groups can be distinguished in the graph; *where
*delta*d = (sd +c) - ld*<p>

i) nd-plants flowering in about the same time after both treatments
(*delta*d approximately 0)<p>

ii) sd-plants flowering significantly earlier after induction by short
day plus low temperature (*delta*d approximately negative), and<p>

iii) ld-plants flowering earlier after induction of long days
exclusively (*delta*d approximately positive).<p>

This is probably true for characters which are controlled by the
photoperiod and vernalization in European populations, as we know from
the intensive studies of K. NAPP-ZINN and D. RATCLIFFE. Ecological
adaptation is determined primarily by the seasonal day length (degree
of latitude), the altitude above sea level, the mean temperature in
early spring, and the mean distribution of preciptation in autumn
(Figure 1).  In certain experiments we have shown that the frequency
of the natural European populations, i.e., of the seed samples of the
AIS-seed bank which have been tested so far, is distributed in 3
groups: one larger group (sd-plants) flowering later under permanent
long day conditions than after cold and short day treatment for 3
weeks; a second smaller group (ld-plants) reacting reciprocally; and
the largest group (nd-plants) (figure 2), where treatments of this
kind make no difference in flowering time.<p>

Other factors may be involved favouring adaptation to certain
ecological conditions. This is true for habitats which are under human
control.  More than 50 p.c. of the populations we have studied were
samples from those proveniences (Figure 1), i.e., they have been
growing on the cultured land of farms and gardens. This argues for
distinct adaptations of these Arabidopsis populations to the life
cycle and physiological characteristics of the crops associated with
that habitat.<p>

Furthermore, iso-enzyme variability has been shown in Arabidopsis
populations. The various types of enzymes are more or less equally
distributed, but one type was only represented by two populations as
it was shown recently by N.S. GROVER.  The genetic control of the
multiple band pattern has been proved, although the tissue-specific
variation of the iso-enzymes were also significant.  Nevertheless,
these studies show that the natural genetic resources of this subject
included polymophism at the molecular level.<p>

Chromosome number and structure represent an aspect of mainly
interspecific variability.  We know that the karyotype of this genus
varies from the diploid number of 10 Arabidopsis thaliana to the
probably polyploid numbers of 16 A. wallichii), 26 A. suecica), 32 (A.
pumila, A. griffithiana), and 48 (A. Korshinsky).  Aneuploidy may also
be found, since some of the species are probably species hybrids of
mostly putative origin (REDEI, 1975). As it will be shown by D.
SCHWEIZER and his group during this symposium, progress in the study
of chromosomal variability depends on an improved characterization of
the chromosome structure especially the chromosome banding. During the
last years this technique has been applied in several animals and
plants, and presently, it allows the most specific characterization of
human chromosomes also.  Furthrmore, use of trisomics will yeild
information on the presently unknown genetic structure of the
polyploid species.<p>

Natural populations of Arabidopsis were often designated as races,
implying genetic identity to a certain degree. But it seems that they
are probably far from being isogenic as progeny analysis of selected
lines has shown. This intra-race variability was detectable only for
special and quantitative characters which are controlled by polygenes.
Several authors pointed out that variation in both physiological and
morphological characters was not significant.  Nevertheless,
spontaneous mutations of about 1 p.c. and random outcrossing of nearly
the same frequency (REDEI, 1975) will cause some genotypic variation.
Obviously the predominantly self-pollinating populations produce
balanced polymorphism for some characters (flowering time, rosette
diameter), which depends on accumulation of mutations, occasional
random cross-fertilization, and the definite selection pressure
favouring heterozygotes. The control of these factors have been
studied and calculated in our subject by I. CETL and his group at
Brunn.<p>

2.  Induced variability of mutants<p>

Now let us compare this kind of polygenic population variability with
the induced variability of mutant lines. The lines can be classified
as follows:<p>

1) ploidy mutants showing deviations in chromosome structure and
number including trisomics as well as haploid lines of tissue culture,<p>

2) morphological mutants (which are predominantly monogenic as far as
it has been shown by classical gene analysis).<p>

3) developmental mutants, and<p>

4) biochemical mutants<p>

This probably incomplete list shows that the mutation
spectrum--although many parts and functions of the plants are
concerned--is rather specific in comparison with the observed
variability of the natural populations. An other example is
demonstrated by the three mutants (F55, F56, and V195) of our present
experiments which do not grow on standard soil.  However, culture of
these homozygous recessive mutants on an appropriate synthetic medium
(modified GAMBORG medium) yield calluses and afterwards flowering and
fruiting plants.  And, last not least, the mutant variability of
Arabidopsis is also highly specific in respect to the amino acid
defects compared to those of microorganisms; G.P. REDEI (1975) has
pointed to this specificity of our subject discussing the molecular
basis of his thiamine mutants.<p>

We may ask about the reasons for this difference in variability.  Is
it due to the different genetic background and/or the selection
pressure?  Obviously the induced mutations are predominantly
monogenic; only some double mutations have been proved in Arabidopsis.
(RELICHOVA, 1975).  But complex pleiotropic effects of the mutated
cistrons have often been observed, for instance in the ch-mutants.<p>

3.  Conclusion<p>

Finally we may postulate significant differences between the
intra-variation of the populations and the mutant lines as follows:<p>

i) the expression of the characters (quantitative for the population,
qualitative for the mutant),<p>

ii) the number of heterozygous loci (higher for the first, lower for
the second),<p>

iii) the adaptation to the environment (broad in the first, specific
in the second),<p>

iv) the selection pressure (in the population favouring the
heterozygotes, but in the mutant only one of the homozygotes, and<p>

v) the origin of the plants (to some extent polyparental in the first,
but in the second strictly monoparental).<p>

By producing mutant lines, we are favourign the mutant genotype; that
is, the humanly controlled selection pressure favours on eof the
homozygotes only. Thus,. the origin of the mutant type is
monoparental, for only one mutant plant in <M1 is the ancestor for the
line. But in a natural population plants may have different9
progenitors. Thus, in populations there is always some plasticity as
to the adaptation to ecological conditions of the habitat; on the
other hand, this capacity for natural adaptaion has been lost in the
mutant lines. &#157;herefore descendants of such individual plants,
showing excelletn homogeneity and genetic stability, are not expected
t survive in the natruaal habitat. But mutatn platns will survive and
grow best under those limited and specific condtions we have
introduced in our experiments (for instance, nutritinal mtuants
growing on a definite synthetic medium).<p>

Evolution of the natural genetic resources is similar to that of
sympatric populations, and in the artificial genetic variability it
equals allopatric populations.  Induced genetic resources are random
and less limited than the spontaneous one of natural poplulations
which is selectively canalized by the ecological conditions of the
habitat.<p>

Evidently both types of variability are indispensable tools in genetic
and botanical research. What part of it may be fixed and will
contribute to further evolution is still an open question. Evidently
both kinds of varibility depend on the present genetic resources in
plants, which we should preserve and use for future investigations.
The international activities for gene conservation must include crop
plants for man's food supply but also important subjects for future
research.<p>
