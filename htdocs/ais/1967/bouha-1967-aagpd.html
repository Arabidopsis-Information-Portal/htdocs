<h2>Diminution of chromosome number in Arabidopsis polyploids</h2><p>

	Hexaploid and octoploid plants of Arabidopsis thaliana had been induced by colchicine treatment of a tetraploid strain. After several generations most of the plants had only 20 somatic chromosomes instead of 30 or 40, and only a few individuals showed a chromosome number higher than 20.  Observations were made to see whether a progressive loss of chromosomes occurs in these high polyploids.<p>

	Chromosome counts are difficult to obtain in polyploid Arabidopsis.  The most reliable method appeared to be counting at meta- or anaphase II in both nuclei of the pollen mother cells.  Flower buds were fixed according to STEINITZ-SEARS (1963) but without evacuation.  After a quick staining in acetocarmine, smears were observed in phase contrast.<p>

	Chromosome numbers were determined (a) in the offspring of a plant with 26-28 somatic chromosomes and in the progeny of two of these plants, and (b) in the offspring of a plant with 2n = 36-38 arisen from a colchicine induced tetraploid as well as in the progeny of two of these plants.  These counts gave the following numbers, some of which being only approximate:<p>

	Many plants had a lower chromosome number than their parent, while an increase was rare.  No single plant with 40 chromosomes was recovered.  On the other hand, the tetraploid strains were =/- stable, and within their progeny only a few aneuploids occurred.  Meiotic studies revealed several causes of chromosome loss in these high polyploids.<p>

(1)  In plants with more than 20 chromosomes some PMS's in the first meiotic division showed a more or less complete splitting or the spindle and of the equatorial plate in two generally unequal parts, one of them frequently including only 2-4 chromosome pairs.  During the second division all the nuclei divided at the same time, but the microspores containing only a few chromosomes were abortive.<p>

(2)  In all plants multivalents and univalents were frequent in metaphase I causing an uneven distribution of the chromosomes during anaphase.  This irregularity produces a large variability in the chromosome numbers during the second division and in the microspore nuclei; it may lead to an increase as well as decrease of somatic numbers in the offspring.<p>

(3)  Frequently 1-3 univalents remained in the spindle median as laggards, being the reason for a decrease in the chromosome number of the microspores.  Nevertheless, some laggards divided during the anaphase I and both strands went to the opposite poles; not undergoing a second splitting they gave an uneven distribution at anaphase II.<p>

	These 3 irregularities sufficiently explain the variability of the chromosome numbers in progenies of high polyploids and the general tendency towards their decrease.  This diminution apparently stops at the tetraploid level, though it seems possible that the 20-chromosome plants so produced do not possess the four compete sets of a true autotetraploid.<p>

	Indeed, two of these 20-chromosome plants gave progenies with a significantly later blooming than the true tetraploids.  However, their meiotic behaviour appeared not to be different, and seed and pollen sterility were not increased.  Further comparison of true and "secondary" tetraploids are thus necessary.<p>
