INTRODUCTION<p>

Cadmium is readily accumulated from growth media and culture solutions
by many plant species; concentrations are generally higher in roots
than in shoots (Babich and Stotzky, 1978; Jastrow and Koeppe, 1980;
Rodecap and Tingey, 1981). Symptoms of cadmium phytotoxicity (direct
effects) include reduced photosynthesis and plant growth, wilting,
chlorosis, red-brown pigment formation in leaf tissues, and stress
ethylene evolution (Page et al., 1972; Haghiri, 1973; Carlson et al.,
1975; Babich and Stotzky, 1978; Rauser, 1978; Jastrow and Koeppe,
1980; Baszynski et al., 1980; Rodecap and Tingey, 1981). However,
little is known about possible residual effects on the progeny of
plants grown in the presence of cadmium.<p>

An Arabidopsis thaliana (L.)Heynh. life cycle bioassay was developed
to detect the direct and residual phytotoxicity of chemicals on
terrestrial plant systems. To evaluate the bioassay protocol,
Arabidopsis populations (first generation) were exposed to various
concentrations of CdCl2; the progeny of these populations (second
generation) were then grown and evaluated in a CdC1 2-free
environment.<p>

MATRIALS AND METHODS<p>

Arabidopsis thaliana seeds (Columbia wild type) were uniformly
distributed onto the surface of the vermiculite growth medium using a
dilute (0.15%) agar solution (Redei, 1970). The plants were cultured
using a double-container hydroponic plot culture system (anonymous,
1978; Ernst et al., 1981) in which the bottom reservoir contained the
nutrient solution, and the upper one (surface area 864 cm 2,
vermiculite depth 13 cm) contained the growth medium (vermiculite #2
grind topped with approxiamtely 0.3 cm of #3 grind). Nutrient solution
was transferred into the upper reservoir via capillary action in
polyester wicking. First generation plants were continuously exposed
to nutrient solutions containing CdC1 2(0, 10, 100, 1.000 microM).
Second generation plants were similarly cultured except that CdC1 2
was omitted.<p>

All plants were grown in a greenhouse under a 16-hr light, 8-hr dark
photoperiod and the sunlight was supplemented with high intensity
discharge sodium vapor lamps. First generation plants were grown
during late summer and early autumn under a light intensity of 106 +/-
35 langleys day and second generation plants were cultured during
winter under a light intensity of 65 +/- 36 langleys day E-1. Maximum
day/minimum night temperatures for both studies were 29 +/-3*degrees*C
and 19 +/- 1*degreeC, respectively.<p>

Germination was determined 7 days after seeding. Plants were observed
frequently to determine when anthesis occurred and to monitor any
visual effects. (Anthesis was reported as the mean number of days
after seeding that each quadrant of a container contained a fully open
flower). Seeds from all plots were harvested when control plots
contained at least 1 plant per quadrant with 3 or more ripe siliques
on its raceme. Two additional seed harvests occurred at weekly
intervals. After the final seed harvest, the plant tissue from each
container was collected and divided into rosettes (vegetative tissue)
and racemes and immature seeds (reproductive tissue). Mature seeds
were air-dried; other tissues were oven-dried at 70*degrees*C to
constant weight. Following determination of dry weights, tissues and
seeds were ground, acid-digested with 2% HC10 4, and analyzed for Cd
using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry
(McQuaker et al. 1979).<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

First Generation. Percent germination for the 0, 10, 100 and 1.000
microM CdC1 2-treated plants averaged 95%, 95%, 95% and 78%,
respectively. Only the percent germination of the 1.000 microM CdC1
2-treated plants was significantly reduced and these plants died
before anthesis. Reduced germination also occurred when seven plant
species native to the midwestrn United States were grown on soil
amended with 30 and 100 micro g gE-1 Cd (Miles and Parker, 1979).
Anthesis occurred within 27 +/- 2 days for the 0 and 10 microM CdC1
2-treated plants but was delayed an additional 10 days for the 100
micro M CdC1 2-treated plants. Similarly, anthesis was delayed in
Arabidopsis plants exposed to mutagens (Brock, 1976). Vegetative,
reproductive, mature seed and total biomass values were not
significantly different for the control and 10 microM CdC1 2-treated
plants (Table 1). In contrast, biomass production by the 100 microM
CdC1 2-treated plants was reduced 78%, 94%, 97%, and 94% for
vegetative, reproductive, mature seed and total biomass, respectively.
Also, the mortality of these plants was approximately 90%. The
Arabidopsis growth reduction occurred at higher Cd concentrations than
with other species. In studies with vegetables, the shoot biomass of
selected species grown on Cd-amended soil (30 micro g gE-1) was
reduced by 18 to 98% compared to respective control plants (Miles and
Parker, 1979), while selected species grown for several weeks in
solution culture containing approximately 15 micro M CdC1 2 showed
growth reductions of 54 to 73% (Turner, 1973). The yield reductions in
the solution culture experiment were attributed to Cd effects and not
an induced nutrient deficiency (Turner, 1973; Bingham et al., 1975).<p>

Table 1: Arabidopsis biomass production *1<p>

*1 Each mean and standard error is based on 4 observations. Total
biomass is the sum of vegetative, reproductive and mature seed
biomasses. Values in parentheses indicate percent reduction in
biomass. Asterisks indicate a significant biomass reduction. The
significance (*alpha*= 0.05) of a biomass reduction was determined by
a one- tailed t-test comparing mean of Cd-treated plants with mean of
corresponding control plants. Second generation plants were grown in
the absence of CdC1 2. The number of seeds sown per plot in the first
and second generations were approximately 340 and 250, respectively.
First and second generation plants were harvested at 76 and 80 days
after seeding, respectively.<p>

Plant species differ in their ability to accumulate Cd from Cd-amended
nutrient solution culture and soil (Jastrow and Koeppe, 1980).
Arabidopsis plants continuously exposed to 10 or 100 microM CdC1 2
accumulated 103 and 361 micro g Cd gE-1 dry tissue in their shoots
(Table 2). The Cd content in the shoots of selected vegetable species
cultured for several weeks in a 9 microM Cd C1 2-amended nutrient
solution ranged from 2 to 158 micro g gE-1 (Turner, 1973), while the
Cd level in the leaves of selected vegetable species exposed to a 9
microM CdSO 4-amended nutrient solution for 3 weeks ranged from 36 to
469 micro g gE-1 (Page et al., 1972). The Arabidopsis plants
accumulated less Cd than some of the vegetable species even though
they were exposed to higher Cd concentrations for a longer time. The
cadmium concentration in the vegetative tissue (rosettes) increased
from 4 to 925 micro g gE-1 as the solution concentration of the Cd
increased from 0 to 100 micro m CdC1 2 (Table 2).<p>

Table 2: Cadmium content of first generation plants. *1<p>

*1. BDL refers to below detection limit. Each mean and standard
deviation is based on 4 observations.<p>

*2. Total biomass is the sum of vegetative, reproductive and mature
seed biomasses. The Cd content of the total biomass is a weighted
average derived from data in Tables 1 and 2.<p>

However, there was no concomitant increase in the Cd content of either
the reproductive tissue (racemes) or mature seeds between the 10 and
100 microM CdC1 2-treated plants. Perhaps Cd-sequestering or some
other mechanism excluded much additional Cd from the reproductive
tissue and seeds. The Cd content observed in Arabidopsis seeds was
less than that of the rosettes or racemes. This pattern was consistent
with the Cd distribution pattern in other plant species (Haghiri,
1973; Bingham et al. 1975).<p>

Second generation. Progeny from the Cd-treated plants were grown in
the same manner as in the first generation but without the addition of
CdC1 2. This was done to assess residual Cd effects on Arabidopsis
growth and vigor. Percent germination and anthesis for the 0, 10, and
100 microM CdC1 2-treated plants were similar and averaged 94 +/- 2%
and 41 +/- 1 days, respectively, indicating no residual Cd effect.
Second generation controls were smaller than corresponding first
generation plants, possibly due to seasonal differences in light
intensity and/or differences in plant numbers; however,
intragenerational comparisons are more important than
intergenerational ones. Vegetative biomass was similar for all second
generation treatments (Table 1). However, reproductive, mature seed,
and total biomass production for the 10 and 100 micro M CdC1 2-treated
plants were significantly reduced (ranging from 18 to 23%). It is not
know if the reduced growth resulted from impaired seed vigor or the
selection of Cd-tolerant plants which grew more slowly.<p>

Cadmium levels in the vegetative tissues of the second generation
plants were similar to those in the first generation controls while
levels in the reproductive and seed tissues were below detection
limits indicating that there was no apparent Cd enrichment or carry
over in these tissues.<p>

SUMMARY<p>

Cadmium induced effects were detected in both Cd-treated, first
generation Arabidopsis populations and their untreated, second
generation progeny, indicating that the Arabidopsis life cycle
bioassay can detect direct and/or residual toxic-induced effects.<p>
