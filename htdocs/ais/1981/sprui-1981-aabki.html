Tests for germinating capacity of seeds are often carried out with
various types of filter paper as a supporting medium. Rehwaldt (1968)
reported variable germination responses of Arabidopsis seeds on
different batches of some common types of filter paper. We were
confronted with a similar phenomenon when Dr G. Blaauw-Jansen (Bot.
Lab., State University of Utrecht) informed us that seeds of a
particularly heavily dormant lot of wild type Arabidopsis that gave
consistent germination responses in our Laboratory on standard filter
paper, failed to germinate after an otherwise identical inductive
pretreatment when floating on water. Various brands of so-called
'qualitative' papers were then tried and found to contain one or more
water-extractable substances in variable amounts that enhance
light-induced germination ('active papers') and that were apparently
absent from acid-washed 'ash-free' filter papers as used for
quantitative analyses ('inactive papers').<p>

Particulars about the seeds, their pretreatment and other details were
published previously (Spruit et al., 1980). After imbibition for 6
days at 2*degrees*C, seeds were mostly exposed to a light-limited
inductive dose of red (658 nm) light indicated in Table 1. It appears
that the active substances are absorbed by activated carbon (5), can
be removed at least partly by washing with water (6) and that the
extracts thus obtained promoted germination (7).<p>

Filter papers for qualitative analyses are reported to contain a great
variety of extractable substances (v. UNRUH et al., 1971). Since the
amount of soluble material is very small and presumably consists
mainly of inactive components, attempts to identify the
germination-promoting factor(s) by direct analysis appeared
unpromising. Instead, we have tested a number of compounds of possible
potential for influencing germination. They were added, mostly in
concentrations of 0.1%, to the imbibtion liquid on the inactive paper
Schleicher & Scholl Nr. 589 2. Among the substances found inactive,
either as such of in combination with 0.0001 M KNO 3 were: soil
extract, peat extract, saw dust extract, glucose, malt extract,
galactose, cellobiose, peptone, aspartic acid, leucine, tryptophane,
cysteine, methionine, thiamine, riboflavin, ammonium chloride, sodium
azide (0.005 M) and methylene blue (0.001M),. The only substances so
far found to display some activity were: casein hydrolysate (DIFCO;
weak activity) and yeast extract (DIFCO; considerable activity), both
exclusively in combination with 0.0001 M KNO 3. Another stimulating
factor proved high pH values as discussed below. We intend to study
the effect of yeast extract in some more detail separately.<p>

Upon our request, the Research Department of Messrs. Schleicher &
Scholl GmbH kindly informed us that their paper for qualitative
analyses nr. 595 which is one of the active types (Table 1, 15 and 16)
contains some polyethyleneimine ('Polymin') which is added during
manufacture to improve wet strength and which is largely removed
during the acid-washing steps for the preparation of 'ash-free' papers
like the inactive S & S nr. 589. This prompted us to investigate the
possible action of polymin. At the same time we had become aware that
various brands of acid-washed papers retain substances imparting a
decidedly acid reaction to unbuffered inbibition media. Distilled
water extracts of various 'ash-free' papers, correspondign to the
ratio paper/water as used in the germination test, had pH values
ranging rom 3.8 to 5.6. We have, therefore, studied the combined
action of pH buffers (0.02 M citrate-phosophate) and polymin. A
concentration of the latter of 0.02 % proved near the optimum. Figure
1 summarises results of a number of experiments.<p>

Figure 1: Germination of seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana on filterpaper
S & S 589 2, lot 25036, with 0.001 M KNO 3 and in the presence (+pol.)
or absence (-pol.) of 0.02% polyethyleneimine, as a function of pH.
Inductive red dose 35 mjcm E-2.<p>

At the non-saturating doses of red light applied in these experiments,
both pH and polymin influence germination levels. The stimulating
effect of polymin reaches a maximum around pH 6.5 and decreases both
towards higher and lower pH values. No influence of any condition on
the dark germination was observed.<p>

These results suggest that polyethylenimine may be one of the main
substances in filter paper that stimulate germination. Irreproducible
or variable germination percentages under nominally identical
conditions may be due to variable amounts of this compound as well as
of acid-reacting substances remaining in different brands or batches
of paper. Our findings also emphasise the desirability of controlling
the pH of the medium when testing seeds for germinating capacity.<p>

the composition of various filter papers and other data.<p>
