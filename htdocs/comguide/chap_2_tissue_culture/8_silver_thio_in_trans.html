AID TO INCREASED EFFICIENCY

*  Recently, Marton & Browse ( Marton, l. & Browse, J. 1991.  Facile 
transformation of Arabidopsis. Plant Cell Rep. 10, 235-239), using a 
modified protocol of Valvekens et al. (Valvekens, D., Van Montagu, M. & 
Van Lijsebettens, M. 1988.  Agrobacterium tumefaciens- mediated 
transformation of Arabidopsis thaliana root explants by using kanamycin 
selection. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 5536-5540), reported that the 
addition of 25mgl-1 silver nitrate to the medium used for shoot 
regeneration leads to a ten-fold increase in the production of transgenic 
Arabidopsis shoots.  We have similarly found, in our efforts to produce 
large numbers of transformed Arabidopsis plants in a programme of 
insertional mutagenesis, that 5mgl-1 silver thiosulphate greatly 
enhances the efficiency of transformation and regeneration.

1.  MODIFIED PROTOCOL
 *  The method we have adopted is essentially that of Valvekens et al., 
but with two alterations. 

  (i) The germination medium (GM) and callus-inducing medium (CIM) are 
supplemented with 5 mgl-1 silver thiosulphate.  Silver thiosulphate is 
prepared by the dropwise addition of silver nitrate solution (2.5 mgml-1) 
to a solution of sodium thiosulphate (14.6 mgml-1).  The filter-sterilised 
stock solution (1.25 mgml-1) is added to the media (4 mll-1) after 
autoclaving.  Silver thiosulphate is used in preference to silver nitrate 
due to its greater mobility in the plant. 
  (ii) We do not place the root explants onto the shoot-inducing medium 
(SIM) in small bundles.  Instead, we prepare SIM with 0.8% (w/v) low 
melting point agarose (SeaPlaque, FMC), allow the SIM to cool to 
approx. 30oC, add the explants (approx. 0.1 g per plate) and pour a thin 
overlay (approx. 10 ml) onto a plate of SIM prepared in the normal 
manner.  We routinely use 35mgl-1 kanamycin for selection of npt-II 
transformants, and keep the explants on the original plates for 4-6 
weeks.  Using this method we have experienced no problems with 
escapes with either the C24 or Landsberg erecta ecotypes.

 *  The advantages of these alterations to the method are three-fold.  
The root systems of plants  grown in GM supplemented with silver 
thiosulphate are better developed than when without  silver.  Hence 
there is more starting material for use in transformations.  The silver 
thiosulphate  leads to a dramatic increase in the frequency of 
transformation and regeneration.  We obtain  over 100 putatively 
transformed calluses per 9 cm Petri dish using this method.  The 
dispersal  of the explants in the overlay ensures that there is a good 
contact between each explant and  the medium, and that individual 
transformants are easily identified and rescued.  Whilst low  melting point 
agarose is expensive, we consider that the greatly facilitated 
manipulation of the  large numbers of transformants justfies the extra 
expense.

 *  In the conditions of our culture rooms (25 +/-1oC, continuous 
illumination) primary  transformants do not set seed very efficiently if 
maintained in Petri dishes.  Therefore, we  rescue shoots from the 
multiple rosette structures which develop from the callus and place  
them on GM either in (a) 25 x 200 mm Sigma tubes, which are closed 
with a cotton wool plug, or  (b) 60 ml Polypots closed with transparent 
SunCap gas-permeable film (Sigma).  Generally,  over 80% of the plants 
set seed.  The seeds produced in vitro often germinate slowly even  
after lengthy vernalization.  Therefore, after germination we transfer the 
seedlings to soil and  collect more seed.  These latter seeds germinate 
more uniformly, facilitating genetic  segregation analyses.

 *  The transformants we have obtained by this method are usually 
phenotypically normal under  the standard growth conditions, and the 
inserted DNA is stably maintained.

b.  CONCLUSIONS
 *  Wounding is important in the process of T-DNA transfer.  Ethylene 
action may have some  inhibitory effect, and silver ions, which are 
inhibitors of ethylene action, may exert their effect  on transformation as 
a result of an effect on ethylene action itself.  Alternatively, the silver may
slow down the growth of Agrobacterium during co-cultivation, such that T-DNA
transfer may  occur without overgrowth of the bacteria which may induce a
hypersensitive response and cell  death.
