The Arabidopsis Information Service (AIS) and seed stock resource was maintained by Prof. A.  R. Kranz at the Botanical Institute of the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany. The AIS newsletter was published from 1964 to 1990 and contains a goldmine of information in the form of brief reports on all aspects of Arabidopis research.<p>

The contents of each AIS issue has been re-entered into computer readable format, and is available on-line through a WAIS search of keywords. The volumes have also been reformatted into HTML documents for WWW presentation.  This effort was carried out by the Boston AAtDB project (Sam Cartinhour, Mike Cherry, John Morris and Howard Goodman) and was been undertaken with the permission and encouragement of Dr. Kranz.  In AAtDB, AIS references are included in the "Paper" class.<p>

The AIS Collection of seed resources gathered by Dr. Kranz have been integrated into those of the <a href="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/home.html">Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre</a> (NASC) and can be found by searching NASC's 
<a href="/seedlist/seedlistquery.html">Seed Catalogue</a> from Stanford.<p>

In addition, colour images of several hundred of the AIS and numerous other lines can be viewed on-line using the NASC
