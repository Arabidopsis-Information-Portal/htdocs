Ploidy mutations induced by colchicine were scored by measuring pollen
diameters.  Mutated plants or plant-sectors give larger pollen.  Some
flowers in the M1 yield normal as well as larger pollen, and are
therefore chimeric.  Studies of the pollen of flowers on the main
inflorescences (the first 15 flowers) and on inflorescences of side
shoots of different orders gave the following results:<p>

(1) The main influorescence is often chimeric especially at the base,
losing chimerism towards the top.  (2) Side shoots of higher order
show progressively less chimerism.  (3) Within the chimeric parts of
the influorescence the flowers also are often chimeric (36% on the
main influorescence in our experiment).  This is in contrast to what
is usually accepted after EMS treatment, viz. little within-flower
chimerism. We are now testing the same for EMS by studying the M3 to
detect heterozygotes in the M2 that may occur in fruits otherwise
scored as normal.  (4) Mutated sectors are not parallel to the
vascular bundles, but slightly twisted in a direction opposite to the
short leaf spiral.<p>

This is part of a study on chimerism; more detailed results will be
published later.<p>
