<h2>CENTROMERE LOCALIZATION OF CHROMOSOME 1 in ARABIDOPSIS</h2><p>

For the localization of centromeres on chromosomes especially
genotypes are useful that have a telocentric chromosome additional to
the diploid complement. This type of trisomics has been alternatively
called, telocentric trisomics, monotelotrisomics, telosomics and
telotrisomics (Khush, 1973). The latter name proposed by Khush and
Rick (1968) is used in our reports. Recently telotrisomics have been
used for centromere localization in tomato (Khush and Rick, 1968),
barley (Fedak, et al., 1972) and in linkage group 5 of Arabidopsis
(Sears and Lee Chen, 1970). In the same paper Sears and Lee Chen
established the direction of the centromere in linkage group 2, by
studying the frequencies of double reduction of some markers of this
group.<p>

Koornneef and Van der Veen (1978) found an association of the markers
an and ch with two different trisomic types (TIA and TIB, rsp.), while
both markers were shown to be linked by Feenstra (1978). As these two
trisomics showed some characteristics of telotrisomics (vis.
segregation ratio's and the production of primary trisomics), it was
concluded that an and ch are on different arms of the same chromosome
(corresponding to rsp. TIA and TIB). By using markers that are located
between an and ch, we tried to localize the centromere of chromosome 1
into more detail.<p>

The linkage relations of dis-1 and dis-2 hae been given by Feenstra
(1978). The thimine auxotrophic mutant V159 is located between dis-1
and dis-2 (Feenstra, pers. comm.) and is probably identical with the
mutation th-1 described by Redei, which has the same nutritional
requirement. This gene was found to be 21.5 +/- 4 map units from an
(Redei et al., 1976), a result in agreement with the position found by
Feenstra.<p>

Table 1: F2 segregation data of crosses of TIA and TIB with a number
of markers in the sequence found by Feenstra (1978)<p>

From the segregation data of F2 populations of crosses between
wildtype telotrisomics and diploid mutants (Table 1) it appears that
TIA carries all markers intercalating an and ch, which means that the
centromere of chromosome 1 must be between dis-2 and ch a distance of
about 10 cM (Table 2 and Feenstra, 1978).<p>

The percentage of recessives among diploid (and total progenies is
increasing the closer the locus is to the centromere (see Table 1).
This can be explained by locus centromere crossing over between the
telocentric chromosome (which carries a dominant allele) and a normal
chromosome (carrying a recessive allele).<p>

This causes an increase in normal chromosome scarrying dominant
alleles. These are the chromosomes that give rise to n gametes. So the
further the distance of a gene is from the centromere, the moe
recombination is possible, resulting in a lower frequency of
homozygous recessive diploids (Reeves et al., 1968). A sedon point in
agreement with the sequence of the loci on the chromosome is the
occurrence of mtuant trisomics (double reduction) when loci are far
from the centomere in contrast to the absence of these genotypes when
the loci are close to the centromere (dis-2 and ch).<p>

The small plans appearing in the progeny of the TIA and TIB trisomic
(up to 10% of all non-diploid plants in the selfed progeny of TIA)
were suspected to be primary trisomics of chromosome 1 (Koornneef and
Van der Veen, 1978). However, because of their high sterility a
trisomic analysis with several markers was very difficult, until this
type of plant became available in er+ background after a cross of TIA
with er+.er+ genotype. (Our "wildtype" is the erecta mutant of the
ecotype "Landsberg"). The presence of this gene caused a significant
increase in fertility and also the flower more clearly showed the
protruding stigma, which is characteristic for the Fragilis trisomic
(Sears and Lee Chen, 1970).<p>

The F2 data of the cross of this plant with ch/ch dis-2/dis-2 showed a
trisomic ratio (Table 2), which confirms: 1) its primary trisomic
nature, 2) the telotrisomic nature of TIA and TIB and 3) also the
presence of linkage group 1 and 4 on the same chromosome.<p>
