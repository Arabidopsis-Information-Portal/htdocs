1.  MEDIA   (i) SOLID MS0 MEDIUM Murashige and Skoog Basal 
Medium,e.g., Imperial Laboratories #9-300-40 3% (w/v) Sucrose 
0.8% (w/v) Agar, e.g., Sigma A7002 pH 5.8

  (ii) LIQUID MSA MEDIUM  As solid MS0 medium, but supplemented 
with: 0.5 mgl-1 2,4-D 0.05 mgl-1 kinetin

  (iii) CALLUS INDUCTION MEDIUM Gamborg's B5 Basal medium e.g., 
Sigma G 5893 2% (w/v) Glucose 0.8% (w/v)Agar 0.5 gl-1 MES 0.5 
mgl-1 2,4-D 0.05 mgl-1 Kinetin pH 5.7

 *  All Petri dishes containing cultures are sealed with Parafilm M or the 
equivalent, e.g., Sigma P 7543.

2.  SEED STERILISATION   (i) Immerse seeds in 10% (w/v) 
"Domestos" (commercial bleach) for 20 min.  Wash twice with 500 ml 
of sterile distilled water, then leave to dry in a laminar flow cabinet 
overnight.   (ii) Push the resulting crust of seeds through a sterile tea-
strainer in order to separate the individual seeds.  Store sterile seeds 
in a 60 mm Petri dish until required.

3.  GERMINATION   (i) Lift sterile seeds with a flamed spatula onto 
MS0 solid media in screw-cap round glass jars, 55 mm diameter, 100 
mm height.   (ii) Place jars under fluorescent lights at about 22oC.

4.  CALLUS INITIATION   (i) When large enough to handle, transfer 
plants to a sterile tile and excise the roots and chop them into 
sections, approximately 1 mm in length.   (ii) Place these pieces onto 
callus induction medium in 60 mm Petri dishes and place in the same 
conditions as for germination.

 *  Alternatively, use the largest leaves for callus initiation.   (iii) 
Transfer each leaf to the tile, then damage it with a sterile scalpel-
blade in order to initiate a wound response.  *  It doesn't seem to 
matter which face of the leaf is placed downwards on the solid 
medium.

5.  INITIATION OF CELL SUSPENSIONS   (i) After callus formation, 
about 2-3 weeks, place a small piece of callus, roughly pea sized, in a 
100 ml conical flask together with 20 ml of liquid MSA medium.   (ii) 
After replacing the aluminium- foil lid, place the flask on a shaker at 40 
rpm in a constant temperature room at about 22oC (either with or 
without light).  *  After 7-10 d, the flask can be sub-cultured.

6.  SUB-CULTURING   (i) Decant all liquid off.  Add 50 ml of fresh 
MSA, then pour everything into a 250 ml flask.   (ii) When the volume 
of tissue has doubled, transfer 30% of the culture to a fresh flask.  *  
From now on, use 100 ml of medium per 250 ml flask.

  (iii) Sub-culture at weekly intervals, even if the tissue appears to be 
growing more slowly.  Adjust the amount of tissue which is used to 
inoculate a new flask in accordance with the growth rate.
