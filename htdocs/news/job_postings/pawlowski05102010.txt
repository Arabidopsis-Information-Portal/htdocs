Postdoctoral position in Pawlowski's lab at Cornell University

A postdoctoral position is available to study chromosome dynamics during meiosis in maize and 
Arabidopsis. The successful candidate will use state-of-the-art 3-dimensional and live microscopy 
combined with genetic, genomic, and proteomic approaches to identify molecular mechanisms 
controlling chromosome motility during meiotic prophase (see Sheehan and Pawlowski (2009) PNAS 106: 
20989-94) and characterize the role of chromosome motility in chromosome homology recognition. 
Specifics of the project will be tailored to the interests of the successful candidate.

Requirements: Ph.D. in genetics, cell biology, plant biology or a related field. Experience in 
molecular biology is essential. The position is available immediately and the starting date is negotiable.
