A postdoctoral position is available in Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics & 
Institute of Plant Genomics and Biotechnology, Texas A & M University to study RNA 
silencing in plants. The research mainly focuses on biological functions and molecular 
events of RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs) inArabidopsis. The postdoc will 
investigate Argonaute-RNA interaction at the molecular and biochemical levels.
Applicants process a Ph.D. with strong background in biochemistry and molecular 
biology. Candidates should be highly self motivated and possess creativity and 
initiative.  Research experience in Arabidopsis orexpertise in bioinformatics skills is a 
plus. Interested applicants should send a CV, brief summary of research experience, and 
contact information for at least three references by email to Xiuren Zhang at 
xiuren.zhang@tamu.edu.
