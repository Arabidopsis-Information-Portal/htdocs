INTRODUCTION<p>

Information about the structure of embryo, the initiation of DNA
synthesis and cell division during germination appears to be important
for the proper understanding of the effect of mutagenic agents and
exogenic DNA on seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana. Some preliminary data
on the germination of seeds and the incorporation of 3H-thymidine into
embryo cells are reported. The anatomical structure of the embryo and
its organization will be presented in successive papers.<p>

MATRIAL AND METHODS<p>

Seeds of thiamine mutant V 131 of Arabidopsis thaliana were presoaked
in water for 24 hours and sown in Petri dishes containing 0.78% agar
dissolved in the mineral nutrient solution of Miksche and Brown (1965)
with thiamine added at 10E-5M concentration; 100 seeds were sown in
five repetitions. The whole experiment was conducted at 214*degrees*C,
16 hours of light a day.<p>

Observation of the numbers of germinated seeds were made in three
repetitions every 12 hrs. during three days. Germinating seeds
remaining were fixed in methanol-chloroform-proprionic acid (6:3:2
v/v/v). Mitotic activity of roots was analysed on squash slides
stained with aceto-carmine (Steinitz-Sears, 1962).<p>

For autoradiographic studies 3H-thymidine at 1 mCi/ml concentration,
26.5 Ci/mM specific activity, was used. After 24 hours of presoaking,
the seeds were incubated with 3H-TdR for 0.5 hr and fixed. Some seeds
which had not been presoaked before were incubated with labelled
thymidine for 24 hrs. These seeds were fixed in ethanol-acetic acid
(3:1 v/v) every second hour. Squashes from isolated embryos were made
with the usage of dry ice. Slides were covered with liquid emulsion
Ilford L4; after seven days of exposure at 4*degrees*C autoradiograms
were developed.<p>

RESULTS<p>

The mature embryo of Arabidopsis thaliana isolated from presoaked
seeds is about 1 mm long (Figure 1). It shows well-developed
cotyledons opposite to each other. The axis of embryo is mainly
constituted by the hypocotyl. The boundary between the hypocotyl and
the radicle cannot be easily distinguished. Shoot apex is
characteristically flat and lies between the bases of the cotyledons.<p>

The first germinated seeds were observed at 12 hrs. after presoaking.
The number of germinating seeds was settled after the following 36
hrs. (Figure 2). First root hairs were observed 24 hours after the
initiation of germination. Lateral roots were formed after six days in
acropetal order.<p>

presoaking.<p>

Earliest mitoses were observed in the roots 15 hrs. after presoaking.
As germination became more pronounced the number of cells undergoing
divisions increased. After 60 hrs. of germination mitotic activity of
meristematic cells was declining to mean three divisions per root
(Table 1).<p>

Autoradiographic studies proved that in presoaked seeds incubated with
3H-thymidine for 0.5 hr nuclei were heavily labelled (Figure 3).
Intensive incorporation occurred in cells of both the root and the
cotyledons. In cotyledons labelled nuclei and chloroplasts were
observed.<p>

3H-TdR.<p>

To determine the exact moment of initiation of DNA synthesis in
embryos of Arabidopsis thaliana dry seeds were incubated with
3H-thymidine. The analysis of autoradiograms indicated that the
incorporation into cell nuclei occurred after 12 hrs. of germination
in the presence of labelled thymidine. Labelled nuclei were observed
in most embryo cells, but labelling was less intensive than that in
embryos incubated with 3H-TdR for 0.5 hr. after presoaking.<p>

The results proved that DNA synthesis was already initiated during the
presoaking and preceded first cell divisions by about 24 hrs. This
seems to indicate that first cell cycle lasts considerably longer than
the mitotic cycle seedling of Arabidopsis, which was determined to
last for 16 hrs. by Van't Hof et al. (1978).<p>
