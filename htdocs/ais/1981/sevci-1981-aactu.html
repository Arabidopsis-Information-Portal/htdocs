The adaptive value of the i-th genotype (w i) representing a relative
measure of Darwinian fitness as compared with another (reference)
genotype may be partitioned into at least two components one of them
being connected with the ability to survive from zygote to adult
(relative viability, (v i), and the other with the mean number of
progeny left by the surviving representative of this genotype
(relative fertility, (f i). Then w i = v i f i.<p>

Cetl and Plchova (1975), Cetl (1976) and Svobodova and Cetl (1977)
demonstrated that in artificial populations of Arabidopsis represented
by the F 2's segregating for a standard and a recessive lethal or
visible mutant allele of the same gene, the two components could be
measured independently by means of determining the number of surviving
individuals and the average number of seeds per individual in the
three genotypes. The discrimination of dominant homozygotes and
heterozygotes was possible either by means of Moller's embryo test in
the experiments with chlorophyll lethals or by means of a following
generation in the experiments with visible mutations.<p>

In the populations studied, the adaptive values of the dominant and
recessive homozygotes as compared with the heterozygote taken as the
reference genotype were different; among all 15 populations only in 3
(or in 20 percent) the adaptive value was about 1 and thus
heterozygote advantage was absent; in 7 populations (47 percent) where
the w values lay between 1 and .5, transitional polymorphism could be
expected, and in 5 populations (33 percent) where the w values were
<.5, stable polymorphism could be expected.<p>

MATERIAL AND METHODS<p>

In the experiments to measure the adaptive value of genotypes in a
system of two loci, several randomly chosen mutant lines were used.
All mutations were induced by X-rays or by N-methyl-N-nitrosourea in
the S96 genotype so that their genetic background was practically the
same. They were recessive with clear phenotypic effects (Relichova,
1976).<p>

Seeds originating from natural autogamy of diheterozygotes +m+n
obtained by means of crossing mm x nn were sown in four replictions
with 200 seeds in each. Three combinations were studied: (1) cpcp x
spsp, (2) chm3chm3 x spsp, and (3) iviv x lc(S)lc(S).<p>

RESULTS<p>

In the F2 populations, plants of all four phenotypic classes surviving
to maturity were scored and the number of seeds harvested in each
plant during 10 days after the harvest of the first pod was counted.
The discrimination of all nine genotypic classes within the four
phenotypic classes was possible in the following generation. The
numbers of plants and the mean numbers of seeds per plant in all nine
genotypes are given for the three combinations in Table 1.<p>

Before measuring the two components of adaptive value the numbers of
plants obtained in the four phenotypic classes were tested for
linkage. A correction for lowered viability of simple and double
recessive genotypes against the corresponding dominant ones was done
according to Serra (1965). Neither the product ratio method nor the
maximum likelihood method revealed linkage in the three combinations.
F.i., in the latter method p +/- sp was .5077 +/- .0317 in cp x sp,
.5030 +/- .0371 in chm 3 x sp, and .4995 +/_ 0266 in iv x lc (S).<p>

Therefore, all estimates of adaptive values and their components could
be based on free combination. The "inefficient" methods of estimation
expressing the errors by means of the results obtained in particular
replication were abandoned and the procedures for maximum likelihood
estimates were elaborated as follows:<p>

(1.1) The maximum likelihood estimates of relative viability (vi) of
homozygotes (I 1, I 3, I 7, I g) as compared with the di-heterozygote
(R) as a reference genotype:<p>

In the homozygotes resulting adaptive values (Table 2) in all
combinations were the lowest. The adaptive values in the hetrozygotes
were higher but did not exceed, in any case, those of the
diheterozygote taken as a reference genotype. In the relative
viability and the relative fertility somewhat more overlapping than in
the adaptive value was observed between homozygotes, heterozygotes and
the reference diheterozygous genotype. It was impossible to find any
relation between viability and fertility indexes. The standard errors
were not very high.<p>

The results seem to suggest that the heterozygote advantage is scaled
according to the number of heterozygous loci. The mean adaptive values
over combinations and genotypes are .18+/- .05 in the homozygotes
(without hetrozygous loci), .43+/- .09 in the heterozygotes (with one
hetrozygous locus) as compared with 1 in the diheterozygote (with two
heterozygous loci). This situation seems to be testifying rather for a
homeostatic than for a medium optimum or additive model (Allard and
Jain, 1962).<p>

At the same time, the adaptive values seem to be dependent also on the
number of mutant alleles, at least as concerns the hetrozygotes. The
corresponding means as above are .60 +/- .12 for one mutant allele,
and .26 +/- .11 for three mutant alleles. Thus, at least within the
group of heterozygotes, the additive effects of genes seem to be
overimposed over the prevailing homoeostatic pattern.<p>

value (w) with their standard errors in nine F 2 genotypes.<p>

CONCLUSION<p>

The possibility of explaining the results in terms of transitional or
stable polymorphism is, in contrast to the conclusions from measuring
adaptive values for one locus, lacking in the system of two loci.
Nevertheless, the mean adaptive values over combinations and genotypes
(.18 for the homozygotes and .43 for the hetrozygotes) do not reach
the levels .25 and .50, respectively, which represent the lower limit
for the ultimate loss of mutant alleles and the fixation of the
standard ones. Thus, excluding the minor even if not negligible
differences between combinations and mutations, the conditions for
stable polymorphism seem to be fulfilled, in average.<p>
