<h2> Genetic analyses of 11 chlorina mutants by diallel crosses</h2><p>

Eleven chlorina mutants induced in the race En-2 of Arabidopsis
showing rosettes of uniform yellow-green colour and nearly normal
morphology and growth had been earlier subjected to mutagenic
treatment for a somatic reversion test (ROBBELEN, 1969, 1972).
Simultaneously, genetic analyses of these mutants were also taken up.
Their first results were already reported (ROBBELEN, 1970).<p>

The accuracy of classification of F1 plants by visual observation was
compared with photometric determination of their pigments (using 80%
aceton extracts) from whole rosettes shortly before the onset of
flowering (cf. ROBBELEN, 1957, for procedure).  The results confirmed
our belief that visual classification of chlorophyll mutants is as
good as any grouping based on photometric determinations.  It is also
simpler and quicker.<p>

Some of the 11 mutants can be distinguished by their leaf colour (cf.
the diagonal of the half chess-board in Fig. 1) and also by their size
or minor characteristics of their rosettes.  The mutants V 93 and V 95
are almost alike, and so are V 290 and V 295; while V 312 and V 81 are
slightly and V 157 definitely "green hearted"; V 308 is often slightly
"yellow hearted".<p>

To establish linkage relationships, several mutants were crossed with
REDEI's markers (cf. REDEI and HIRONO, 1964, and Arabidopsis Research,
Rep. Int. Symp. Gottingen 1965, p 210).  The chlorina mutant character
of V 157 was found to be linked with an (narrow leaves; group 1), the
two being 12.6 Morgan units apart (calculated from 3705 F2 plants of V
157 an x wild type at coupling phase).  The non-complementary nature
of F1's of V 89, V 300, V 312, and V 318 indicated allelism of their
mutant characters. This locus is linked to vc2 (shiny stems of
inflourescence; group 6) but as yet segregation data from combinations
in repulsion phase are only available.  Another possible allelic group
consists of mutants V 95, V 295, and V 308 (cf. Fig. 1).  This locus
and the mutated loci for V 290, V 81, and V 93 in Figure 1 did not
exhibit closer linkage to each other nor to any of the used
morphological markers of REDEI.<p>

Figure 1: Leaf colour of F1 plants.  (filled) green, (three quarters
filled) light green, (half filled) yellowish green, (quarter filled)
yellow green and (open circles) yellow (= mutant type).  The figures
in boxes give *gamma* chlorophylls/g fresh weight of leaves (mean of at
least two determinations).  The top value gives the chlorophyll
content of F1's with the above written mutant as the maternal parent,
and the lower value with that listed on the left side as the mother.<p>

Figure 2: F2 segregation data.  The phenotypic classification is the
same as in Figure 1.  In each box the two top circles represent the
parental classes.  To the right the relative frequency of each type is
given in percentage.  At the above left side, the number of F2 plants
studied.  The Roman numerals below left in each box signify the
assumed digenic segregation as given in Table 1.  h): lighter in
colour than both parents; i): intermediate in colour between parents;
A: allelic mutations; * : deficit of recessive and especially the
double recessive types<p>

The non-allelic mutants are generally assumed to show full
complementation in the F1's.  However, the data in Fig. 1 again
clearly indicate at least partial non-allelic non-complementation in
many instances of heterozygous combinations.  Similar instances in
other organisms (e.g., in Neurospora; FINCHAM, 1966) have been
interpreted as indicating that such non-allelic mutants are concerned
with the formation of the same heteropolymer.  But other explanations
may also be possible in our case as chromosome deletions and
interactions of entirely unrelated metabolic pathways having a
secondary influence on leaf pigment synthesis.<p>

The F1 V 290 x V 95 was exceptional.  It was yellow with plants larger
than the parental types.  The reciprocal combination was green. The
reason for this difference has not been understood.<p>

The F2 segregation data of the diallel crosses are given in Figure 2.
The segregation data of crosses with the Enkheim (En) wild type show
that all mutants are monogenic and recessive.  Only V 312 showed about
50% deficit of recessives.  Barring the before-mentioned cases of
allelism (A), hybrids between mutants produced variable classes of
phenotypes.  In many instances both the parental types appeared; in a
few cases the double mutant type was also seen (I, III, VII).  In all,
dominant and epistatic interactions produced 7 different ratios (Table
1).  They were sometimes modified by deficiencies of the recessives
(marked by * in Fig. 2).  This was specially true in crosses involving
V 81.  Here the double recessives were not obtained in majority of
cases.<p>

Table 1: Assumed digenic segregation<p>

Chi square tests suggested several possible cases of misclassification
of phenotypes.  This may be understandable in view of the relatively
high environmental influence on the expression of green-yellow
gradations of leaf colour.  For instance, several green segregates of
the cross V 93 x V 89 were probably "light green" genotypically.  Some
segregates were difficult to classify in certain other crosses, like V
300 x V 157 and V 300 x V 295 also.  In the cross V 290 x V 157 the
excess of one of the parental types might have resulted from a random
addition of the double mutants.  In the cross V 308 x V 157, the
fourth class from above did not probably represent a separate
genotype, but combined instead to the second parental class
(increasing its frequency to 18.6%).  Similarly, in the F2's of V 308
x V 300 and V 295 x V 157, some of the yellow classes might have to be
merged.  Finally, observed segregations of V 290 x V 89, V 290 x V
300, and V 81 x V 157, cannot be explained without making progeny
tests.<p>

Two other cases remain to be mentioned.  (1) The cross V 290  x V
95 yielded only a single class of yellow F2 plants.  The reciprocal
has not been grown.  (2) The F2 from the yellow F1 of the cross V 89 x
V 157 segregated in the ratio 1:2:1, as if the mutated loci of the
parents were closely linked.  But, it has been seen that the mutated
locus of V 89 is linked to group 6 and that of V 157 to group 1.
Since the two mutated loci of the parents are nonallelic, the F1
heterozygote should have appeared like the wild type. Thus this F1
looks apparently like a case of complete non-complementation.<p>

In summary, the F1 and F2 data from this study involving diallel
crosses reveal a complex pattern of genetic interactions (even for
allelic mutations) in spite of the phenotypic similarity of the
selected 11 chlorina mutants.  This supports the idea that different
"chlorophyll mutations" (which in mutation experiments are frequently
grouped together) may be radically different in respect of their
biochemical/physiological nature and genetic origin.<p>
