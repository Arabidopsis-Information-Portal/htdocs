Adaptation to higher D20 concentrations by certain genotypes of
bacteria, algae, yeast, molds, etc., is one of several interesting
observations recently summarised by KATZ and CRESPI (1966).  An
improved capacity of the microorganisms to divide in higher D20
concentrations than in lower ones was recognized by these authors as
an expression of adaptation.  The term 'adaptation' or habituation' in
higher plants was first used by STEIN and FORRESTER (1963) for
explaining the overcoming of low levels of tolerance to high
concentrations of D20 by pea roots.  They expressed adaptation in
terms of improved rate of growth due to stepwise rise of D20 level in
the growth medium.  DOBBINS (1967) observed an initial decrease in the
growth rate of mesocotyl cells of Zea mays in 80% D10 followed by a
gradual rise in the growth rate with passage of time.  Our studies
(BHANDARKAR, 1967) on barley seedlings grown on 50% D20 for 9 days
also showed a decrease in D20-induced retardation of shoot-elongation
rate with time.  These observations illustrate the 'adaptation' of the
tissue to D20.<p>

An inhibition of growth in Arabidopsis thaliana by D20 has been
reported earlier (BHATIA and SMITH 1966, BHANDARKAR and GAUR 1967).
We have now investigated the possibility of adaptation to deuterium by
this plant through stepwise increase in D20 content in the media.<p>

The culturing techniques, in the present study, were similar to those
described earlier (BHANDARKAR and GAUR, 1967). The experiment
consisted of six treatments as follows:<p>

Table 1: Days taken for the germination, growth and development of A.
thaliana cultured on 0, 25 and 37.5% D20 levels in the first and
second generation.<p>

The data in Table 1 represent the growth rates (as time taken to
attain various growth and developmental stages) of plants grown in
different deuteriated media and from seeds with and without any
deutrium content.  As reported earlier (BHANDARKAR and GAUR, 1967)
postponement in the organogenetic development is observed when
protiated seeds are grown in nutrient-agar containing 25% and 37.5%
D20 (columns a, b, and c).  The seeds used in D1(0) and D2(0) were
obtained from soil and agar culture respectively. This may perhaps
account for the relatively earlier growth of plants in D1(0) than in
D2(0).<p>

Table 2: D20-induced delay (days) in germination, growth and
development of A. thaliana by differential deuteriation of seeds in D1
generation (a, b, c, d, e and f are the same as in Table 1).<p>

Table 2 contains the data on the extent of delay due to various D20
treatments.  It can be seen from columns A and B that there is a
greater delay in organogenesis (or decrease in growth rate) with
increasing deuterium concentration in the culture media. The same is
found to be true when partially deuteriated seeds, secured from D1(25)
treatment, are grown on 25% and 37.5% D20 media (columns C and D).
Taking into consideration their respective controls, plants from
D2(25) showed a more retarded growth rate than those from D1(25)
(columns A and C).  Similarly, the delay in growth induced by a
uniform rise of 12.5% D20 appears to be greater in second generation
than in the first (columns E and F).  This is very significant yet
contrary to expectation on the premise that prior culturing giving
rise to partial deuteriation of seeds does impart adaptation in
plants.<p>

Taking improvement in growth rate leading to faster organogenetic
development as a criterion of adaptation, our results show that under
the experimental conditions followed here, Arabidopsis thaliana does
not exhibit the phenomenon of adaptation to deuterium reported in some
other higher plants.<p>
