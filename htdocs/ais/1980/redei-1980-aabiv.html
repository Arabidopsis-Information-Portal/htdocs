During the past two decades, over one hundred chemical compounds have
been tested for mutagenicity in Arabidopsis (Redei, 1980; Moller,
1972). Information is also available from animal assays for the
potential neoplastic effects of the same compounds (Redei et al.,
1980). Of 56 known or suspected carcinogens tested with animals for
neoplastic effects, 49 (88%) are strong or weak mutagens for
Arabidopsis.<p>

This efficiency of Arabidopsis appears comparable or better than the
most widely used Salmonella test (Hollstein et al., 1979). The false
negatives in Arabidopsis do not entirely overlap with the bacterial
assay; therefore, it may have a useful role in monitoring genetic and
carcinogenic hazards. A properly constructed test with Arabidopsis can
simultaneously detect mutations at an estimated 10,000 to 14,000 loci.
Thus, it compares favorably with both prokaryotic and eukaryotic
assays.<p>
