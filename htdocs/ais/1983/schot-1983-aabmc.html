BACKGROUND AND AIMS<p>

In continuation of the Apollo and the Apollo-Soyuz missions further
studies on the biological effectiveness of cosmic radiation especially
of particles of high atomic number Z and high energy (HZE-particles)
and their nuclear desintegration stars are necessary in order to
evaluate the load of cosmic radiation during short- and long-duration
flights in space (Bucker et al., 1975, 1977).<p>

General aims of the next Biostack projects are: dosimetry of cosmic
rays at different positions in the space shuttle, determination of the
biological effectiveness of individual HZE particles, and registration
of interactions with other space environmental factors (zero gravity,
vacuum, and UV radiation). Special aims of the coinvestigation with
plants are: improvement of track and hit analysis in monocellular
spores and multicellular seeds of eukaryotic plants, determination of
the radiobiological inactivation induced by heavy ions, indication of
biological damages caused by HZE-fission particles and recording of
HZE-induced mutations.<p>

CONSTRUCTION OF DETECTOR UNITS<p>

Improvement of the Biostack conception was achieved by composing new
and additional biological specimens and nuclear track detectors. A
special sandwich construction consisting of visual plastic detectors
(cellulose nitrate, AgCl crystals) or emulsion detectors (K 5) and
seeds of Arabidopsis or ascospores of Sordaria is used. In this way
the physical and biological events produced by HZE-particles inside
the tissue and cells can be correlated with higher precision.<p>

The following biological objects are used with the Advanced Biostack
experiment:<p>

In order to prevent harmful pressing of seeds, the detector sheets
with seeds fixed by luviskol (10% in ethanol 50% solution) were
covered with grids of makrofol (300 micro m). Ascospores were
distributed on the detector surface by natural shooting from ripe
perithecia without adhesive.<p>

and total amount of seeds rsp. spores prepared for Biostack payloads
of LDEF- and SL 1-space flight mission.<p>

For both experiments number and kind detector sheets covered with the
biological objects are listed in Table 1. Total number of seeds rsp.
ascospores to be exposed in space in each of the experiments are
indicated there too.<p>

POSITIONING OF FLIGHT HARDWARE<p>

The fluence of cosmic radiation (HZE-particles) depends on the
location of Biostack-experiment on the space shuttle (Spacelab S1-1
mission) rsp. long duration exposure facility (LDEF mission).
Therefore several positions with different shielding against space
radiation are used during both missions. The Sl-l experiment (Advanced
Biostack) consists of three detector units inside the spacelab (Al,
A2, B1) and one unit set up on the open shuttle pallet (B2) with lower
shielding. The LDEF experiment (Free Flyer Biostack) includes eight
units arranged in the side tray (Sl to S8-F) and twelve units
installed on the earth tray (El - to El2-F) with higher shielding
(Figure 1).<p>

TIME SCHEDULE OF MISSION<p>

The time schedule for preparing and carrying out the Advanced Biostack
experiment run as follows: deadline stacklist Apr. 83, preparation of
nuclear detector and biological sheets May-June '83, punching and
stacking July-Aug '83, delivery to NASA September 83, launch date Oct.
revised to Nov. '83, recovery of Sl-1 and disassembly of stacks Dec.
'83. The time schedule proposed for Free Flyer Biostack experiment is
the following: deadline of stack list Oct. '83, preparation of
detectors and foils for biological sheets Nov. '83, stacking and
integration Ded. '83, delivery to NASA Jan. '84, launch date Apr. '84,
recovery of LDEF and disassembly of stacks Apr. '85. Thus evaluation
will probably start in Jan. '84 (Sl-1) rsp. June '85 (LDEF).<p>
