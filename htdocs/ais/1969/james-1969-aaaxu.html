The inhibitory effects of the antimetabolites 8-azaguanine (AG) and
para-fluorophenylalanine (FPhe) on the development and metabolism of
some plants have already been reported (BULL and FAULKNER, 1964;
HEYES, 1963; MILLER and ROSS, 1966).  The purpose of this study is to
make an evaluation of the overall effects of these two analogues on
the developmental aspects of the M1 plants of Arabidopsis thaliana.<p>

The different concentration gradients of these analogues were prepared
in the mineral medium (JACOBS, 1964) on a weight to volume basis. The
basic substrate-perlite was supplemented with these culture solutions.
Plants were subjected to continuous illumination with a temperature of
24+/- 1.5*degrees*C.  Light intensity and relative humidity were 9000
lux and above 70%, respectively.<p>

Critical concentrations of these analogues which adversely affect the
development were found to range from 1x10 E-5 to 1x10 E-4M for AG and
5x1010 E-5 to 5x10 E-4M for FPhe.  Rate of germination was practically
unaffected at lower concentrations but higher concentrations partially
or completely inhibited the normal process of germination.  greater
concentrations of these substances also prevented the production of a
normal tap root system; such concentrations of FPhe (for example, a
concentration of 2.5x10 E-4M) induced the profuse development of hairy
lateral roots.  As regards the development of leaves, these
concentrations of both analogues either delayed or prevented the
formation of a full rosette (cotyledons and 6 leaves).  The leaves
were darker in colour when the AG concentration was high.  Plants
grown in FPhe showed considerable reduction in the size of the
rosette. Time of flowering presented great variations.  The visible
initiation of the floral apex and the opening of the first flower bud
were remarkably delayed in various concentrations of the analogues.
Survival at maturity and fertility were also affected with increase in
the concentration levels. The Table given below shows the important
inhibitory effects of these two analogues in Arabidopsis thaliana when
supplied at moderate levels.<p>
