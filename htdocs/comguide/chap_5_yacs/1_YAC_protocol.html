2.  STORAGE AND AMPLIFICATION OF THE LIBRARY
*  For permanent storage of a YAC library a frozen copy in microtiter 
plates should be prepared.

  (i) Grow colonies for 2 d in 150 ul liquid SD-medium (-URA/-TRP).
  (ii) Add glycerol to a final concentration of 20% before freezing the 
library at - 70oC. 
 *  This copy should not be defrosted unless absolutely necessary.

*  The library used on a daily basis is a copy on SD (-URA/-TRP) agar 
medium.  At least every 2 to 3 months this copy should be replaced by a 
fresh one. 

3.  PREPARATION OF FILTERS
(This protocol is a modified version of a protocol by Coulson et al. (1988)
Nature 335, 184 - 186.) 
  (i) To prepare the master filter, grow colonies derived from a SD agar 
plate for 2 d at 30oC on a SD agar plate.  We usually grow 768 gridded 
clones on a single plate.
  (ii) Carefully bring a dry, labelled filter (Hybond N nylon 
membranes/Amersham) in contact with the yeast colonies.  Leave the 
master filter for a few sec on the agar plate, then remove it and layer it on 
a carefully dried (leave them at least one d at r.t. before use) SD plate 
with the colonies up.  Incubate for approx. 2 h at 30oC.
  (iii) Wash a glass plate thoroughly with water and ethanol and put a dry 
autoclaved 3MM filter paper (same size as the master filter) on it.  Prewet 
a labelled Hybond N filter by placing it for a few minutes on a dry agar 
plate (leave at least one dat r.t. before use).  Transfer the master onto 
the 3MM paper (colonies up) and layer the wet site of the slave filter 
carefully on the colonies of the master filter.  Put 2 sterilised 3MM filter 
papers and finally a glass plate on top of the stack and apply brief hand 
pressure.  Remove glass plate and filter papers and put the slave filter 
back on its plate (colonies up).  The master can be used up to 6 times to 
produce slave filters, then put the master back on its growth plate and 
allow it to rehydrate for 10 min.  Then it can be used again (at least 80 - 
100 times in total).  The 3MM filter papers should be exchanged after a 
couple of offsets.
  (iv) Grow the slaves for about 3 d at 30oC to obtain small colonies.
  (v) Lay the filters for a few minutes on a 3MM filter paper sheet soaked 
with SOE / DTT (colonies up).  Wipe out the growth plates and place 
3MM filter paper sheets of the same size as the nylon filters in the plates 
(they fit better in the lids).  Soak each filter paper with 4 ml of SOEM 
containing 1 mgml-1 Novozyme 234 (Novo Enzyme Products).  Place 
each slave (colonies up) carefully on a filter paper, avoiding air bubbles 
and close the plates.  Make sure that no liquid drops come in contact 
with the colonies.  Seal plates in plastic bags and incubate overnight at 
37oC.
 *  This step has to be performed in a fume cupboard.

  (vi) The easiest way of processing many filters is to use trays that hold 
10 - 15 filters.  Processing of the spheroplasts is performed on 3MM filter 
papers soaked with the following solutions:
(a)  10% SDS
(b)  0.5 M NaOH / 1.5M NaCl
(c)  0.5 M Tris - HCl / 1.5M NaCl, pH 7.4
(d)  0.5 M Tris - HCl / 1.5M NaCl, pH 7.4
(e)  2 x SSPE
 *  The membranes are incubated at each step for 5-10 min. At least the 
first 3 steps should be  performed in a fume cupboard. Extreme care 
must be taken that no air bubbles are trapped  under the slave filters. 
The processing can be monitored by the colour change of the yeast  
colonies.
 *  The trays with the soaked 3MM papers can be used at least up to 15 
times if the papers are  rinsed with fresh solution each time.  Only for the 
denaturation solution the 3MM paper has to  be exchanged after 3 or 4 
uses.  Make sure that no liquid drops come in contact with the  colonies.

  (v) Finally, dry the filters at r. t. then bake them for 2 h at 80oC.
 *  Dry filters can be stored for several months at r. t.

4.  PROBING OF THE LIBRARY (HYBRIDISATION AND WASHING 
CONDITIONS)
*  Probing of the library can be performed by using either random primed 
DNA or riboprobes.

    (i) Prehybridise filters at 62oC for 4 h with the hybridisation solution 
(Church and Gilbert, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1984) 81, 1991 - 1995).  
Carry out the hybridisations at the same temperatures (o/n 
to 24 h).  It is not necessary to change the buffer.
    (ii) After hybridisation, the probe is removed and the filters are washed 
twice: 20-30 mins at 62oC with washing solution A and 20-30 mins with 
washing solution B at 62oC.  The filters are then rinsed in 3 x SSC and 
exposed in plastic bags without drying. 
    (iii) Signals can be identified after an overnight exposure, however, for 
assigning the positively hybridising colony a longer exposure (3 d-1 
week) might be necessary.
