	In a preliminary experiment seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana race Estland were exposed to 6943 r ruby laser beam to study its effects on the growth of M1 plants.<p>

	A model 600 Laser manufactured by Maser Optics, Inc. giving laser pulses of 0.0005 sec. duration was employed in the experiments.  Two different methods of laser exposure were used.  Seeds were soaked in water for one hour and either subjected to the laser beam through a microscope (focused beam) or put directly in the path of the laser beam (unfocused).  Untreated controls were also maintained.  Subsequent to the exposure, the seeds were grown in aseptic test tube culture in continuous illumination at 78+/- 2*degrees*F.<p>

	Effects observed are summarized in the table.  Laser energy is detrimental to the viability of the seeds, the effect being very high in the foxused beam. Vigorous and early flowering as well as increase in the average number of flowers, number of branches and height of plants at 30 days growth were evident in the unfocused treatment.  Focused laser beam is very small in diameter as compared to the size of the seed and in all probability the area of impact in the different seeds was not the same. This would explain the high mortality as well as erratic results in this experiment.  Unfocused beam would irradiate the seed more uniformly.  The unusual results in the unfocused treatment may be due to several causes which are under investigation at present.  It is also intended to study the genetic effects and the mutagenic properties of laser irradiaion.<p>
