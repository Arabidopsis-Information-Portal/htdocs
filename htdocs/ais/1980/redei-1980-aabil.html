Population and quantitative genetics rely heavily on theoretical
models, which require experimental verification for general
acceptance. Arabidopsis may serve as a biological tool in such
investigations. Let us consider heterosis.<p>

If vigor is measured by reproductive advantage, the fitness of a
homozygous recessive (R) may become w aa = 1 - s, where s is the
coefficient of selection against this class. The frequency of
homozygous recessives may be determined by the rate of mutation (u)
from allele A to allele a; the average proportion of the recessive
class is expected to be q2 = u/s. The average fitness of the
population can thus be defined as w=1 - sq 2=1-s(u/s) =1 - u (LI,
1976). The average fitness of the entire population depends,
therefore, on the rate of mutation to the undesirable recesive allele.
Since deleterious mutations can occur at many loci, the average
fitness of a population will be proportional to the mutation rate of
the loci, i.e., u1 + u2 + u3 + ... + un, which can be rewritten as nu.
Here n is the number of loci in which mutations occur, and u is the
average rate of mutation per gamete per generation. In Arabidopsis,
the number of genes was estimated to be between 9.000 and 21.000
(Redei and Redei, 1980). The average rate of spontaneous mutation per
locus is not available, yet most research workers would probably
accept an estimate of 10E-5.<p>

Substituting these figures into the formula just derived, we find that
nu may vary from 9.000 x 10E-5 = 0.09, to 21.000 x 10E-5 = 0.21. In
other words, recessive mutations may have reduced the actual fitness
of the population by 9 to 21%. If these populations should carry at
least one dominant allele at all loci, the performance of the hybrids
might exceed that of the parents by 9 to 21%. These predictions are in
reasonable agreement with experimental data obtained with several
Arabidopsis ecotypes (Langridge, 1962).<p>

Occasionally, higher heterosis has also been observd in Arabidopsis
(Dierks, 1958). In this case, the heterosis was obviously based on the
dominance of a few qualitative rather than quantitative genes. Another
possibility is over dominance. This mechanism of heterosis is based on
allelic complementation (Li and Redei, 1969), and again the vigor of
the hybrids is limited.<p>

Really large hybrid vigor can be expected only in allogamous species,
where the recessive alleles are generally sheltered. In these species,
the average reduction of fitness on inbreeding is equal to the product
of n times the square root of s times u (n*sq.rt.(su)). By
substituting n = 10,000 genes, s = 0.01 selection coefficient, and u =
10E-5 mutation rate, we obtain n*sq.rt.(su) = 3.162. Thus, the
hybrid/parent yield ratio may be about 3. Actual experimental data are
again in good agreement with the expectation (Wright, 1976).<p>
