Post-doctoral position: Symbiosis in Brachypodium distachyon
A post-doctoral position is available to explore mineral nutrition and AM symbiosis in 
Brachypodium distachyon.  B. distachyon is a wild grass species 
(http://www.brachypodium.org/) that is used as a model for the temperate grasses. In grassland 
ecosystems, AM fungi are frequently the dominant mutualistic microorganisms and the impact of 
the AM symbiosis on grass mineral nutrition, growth and shoot architecture is well documented. 
The project seeks to determine the molecular basis of functional diversity among AM symbioses. 
The project will include the use of Solexa sequencing to profile gene expression in functionally 
diverse AM symbiosis, and reverse genetics approaches for analysis of gene function.
Requirements:  Applicants must have a Ph.D., demonstrated expertise in genetics or molecular 
biology and a strong publication record.  Experience with plant-microbe interactions or research 
experience with grasses is beneficial but not essential.  
To Apply:  Applicants should submit a CV, the names of three references and a letter 
summarizing research interests and relevant experience to Dr. Maria J. Harrison, 
(mjh78@cornell.edu.) 
Project Location:  The Boyce Thompson Institute is a non-profit research institute affiliated 
Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, www.bti.cornell.edu. EOE M/F/D/V
