   Project Description
   
   Background: Little is known about the mechanisms that determine
   organellar fate during cytokinesis. As cells enter mitosis, the
   nuclear envelope breaks down and rearrangements occur in the structure
   of the cytoskeleton and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In addition, Golgi
   bodies, peroxisomes and mitochondria must re-duplicate so that
   daughter cells are equally partitioned. We have in place techniques
   for studying cell divisions at high resolution in a developmental
   context. The arabidopsis root meristem is an ideal system in which to
   study cell division in situ. Fluorescent protein marking of organelles
   combined with confocal microscopy and image analysis of tissue 3D/4D
   reconstructions will enable us to answer a number of questions about
   organelle behaviour in the cell division zone. For example, i) what
   role does the ER play in cell plate and nuclear envelope formation,
   and ii) when do Golgi bodies re-duplicate and how are they partitioned
   between daughter cells?
   
   Project:
   
   1) Cytokinesis in wild-type roots. Arabidopsis roots are ideal for
   imaging when grown in coverslip-bottomed containers as they remain
   healthy and continue to grow during observation. The student will
   first learn high resolution live-cell imaging techniques by studying
   cytokinesis in arabidopsis roots that have been stably transformed
   with H2B-YFP which is a histone marker (Kurup et al, 2006) (fig.1).
   This marker allows observation of nuclei during prophase and of
   chromatin during other phases of the cell cycle. Co-Supervisor's
   laboratories have fluorescent markers for other organelles. These will
   be co-transformed into the nuclear-marking line in appropriate
   combinations to describe the dynamics and disappearance / reappearance
   of organelles during the cell cycle. We will concentrate on behaviour
   of the ER, nuclear envelope and Golgi bodies during this phase. We
   will use a cyclin marker that indicates entry into metaphase prior to
   chromatin condensation for ease of targeting about-to-divide cells in
   subsequent experimentation.
   
   2) Photoactivation of organelles during mitosis. JR has developed a
   technique for monitoring organelle development and dynamics using
   photoactivatible fluorescent protein marking (Runions et al., 2006).
   This technique utilises the short wavelength laser of the confocal
   microscope system to either switch fluorescent proteins on or to
   change their colour. The student will activate regions of ER both
   proximal and distal to the site of cell-plate formation at different
   phases of mitosis to monitor the contribution of existing ER into the
   new cell plate and into the nuclear envelope. In addition, Golgi
   bodies marked with the `kaede' fluorescent protein will be colour
   photoswitched so that we can assess their dynamics during daughter
   cell partitioning in later stages of mitosis.
   
   3) Cytokinesis defective mutants. Several mutant lines of arabidopsis
   have altered tissue morphology due to defects in cytokinesis (Jergens,
   2005). These are distinct from cell-wall and cytoskeleton mutants and
   seem to affect cell division because of defects in secretory pathway
   function. Genes that play a role in cell division and that affect root
   patterning include SCD1 (At1g49040), a homologue of the guanine
   nucleotide exchange factors that regulate Rab GTPases and which affect
   intracellular protein transport (Falbel et al., 2003), and several
   including the KEULE-like loci which are Sec1p homologues that play a
   role in membrane fusion (Sollner et al., 2002). Mutant arabidopsis
   lines that are defective for these genes will be crossed with the
   H2B-YFP nuclear marking line so that the role of the ER in defective
   cytokinesis can be monitored using the techniques described above.
   
   Ultimately, the student will report on the role of ER, and on the
   behaviour of Golgi bodies and the nuclear envelope during normal and
   defective cell division. This will be a significant contribution to
   our understanding of cell function.
