<H2>600 colour-images now on NASC's WWW server</H2>

The NASC  World Wide Web Server now contains 
on-line access to high-quality colour-images of over 600 of NASC's Stock 
lines.   <P>

Stocks with an associated image now include a small  
(thumbnail) picture in their description file. Clicking on the  
thumbnail links to a more-detailed image. In addition, all the  
images have been collected together in a 
<A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/IMAGES/PIC_BOOK/pic_book_contents.html">
"Picture Book."</a>   
This can be browsed and provides links to the relevant Stock  
descriptions.   <P>

The incorporation of images into the NASC WWW server  
was carried out by David Flanders with funding from the  
UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research  
Council (BBSRC). <P>

<H2>95 Seed List</H2>
Work has started on this years Seed List which will be released in June.
New lines for release will include Redei Lines currently distributed by 
the ABRC, Promoter trap lines from Patrick Gallois and chromosome pools
of the Lister and Dean RI Lines for quick mapping analysis.

<H2>Wisconsin Conference</H2>

NASC and ABRC will have a booth at the 6th International Arabidopsis Meeting in June. There will be computer demonstrations of all the Arabidopsis information available on the Internet. I hope to see many of you there.
