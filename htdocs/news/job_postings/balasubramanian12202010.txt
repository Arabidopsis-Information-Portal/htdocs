Post-doctoral positions available in Australia

Two post(doctoral positions with an initial funding for at least 2(years is 
available in the laboratory of Sureshkumar Balasubramanian (SKB Lab - where 
science is fun!) at the School of Biological Sciences, The University of 
Queensland, Australia. 

SKB lab is interested in deciphering the molecular basis of phenotypic variation 
and we exploit natural variation in Arabidopsis*thaliana to address the same 
(Balasubramanian et al, Nature Genetics, 2006., Balasubramanian et al, PLoS 
Genetics, 2006, Sureshkumar et al, Science, 2009). Currently, SKB lab is focussed 
on two major themes of research. We are interested in thermal adaptation in 
plants and we are exploring Arabidopsis*thaliana as a system to study 
fundamental aspects associated with the genetics of repeat expansions. The 
postdoctoral researchers will participate in projects that are supported by the 
Australian Research Council (ARC) and the National Health and Medical 
Research Council (NHMRC).  We are looking for motivated individuals who are 
interested in exploratory interdisciplinary research. 

Interested candidates are requested to contact Dr. Sureshkumar 
Balasubramanian with their CV, a brief description of their PhD work and names 
and addresses of 2 referees. For further details please contact at
