*  This method routinely yields 200ugg-1 fresh weight.

1.  EXTRACTION BUFFER
50mM Tris-Cl, pH 8
150mM NaCl
5mM EDTA

2.  EXTRACTION
  (i) Freeze 10 g tissue in liquid nitrogen and grind to a fine powder in a 
mortar and pestle.  Put powder into a 50 ml disposable centrifuge tube.
  (ii) Thaw tissue in 25 ml of extraction buffer and 5 ml of 10% SDS.  
Polytron the sample until it resembles a green milk-shake.
  (iii) Centrifuge at 4,000rpm in a Sorvall RC3C rotor for 10 min, to pellet 
debris.
  (iv) Transfer the supernatant to a fresh 50 ml polypropylene tube.  Top 
the tube off with phenol and shake briefly.
  (v) Centrifuge at 4,000rpm in a Sorvall RC3C rotor for 5 min.
  (vi) Transfer upper phase to a clean centrifuge tube.
  (vii) Repeat steps (iii) to (v) twice using a phenol:chlorofrom (1:1 
mixture) extraction and then once with a chloroform extraction.
  (viii) Add 16 ml of 5M LiCl, i.e., keep the LiCl concentration >2M.
  (ix) Mix, and precipitate o/n at 4oC in siliconised Corex tubes.
  (x) Centrifuge for 10 min in a Sorvall SS34 rotor at 6000rpm, 4oC.
  (xi) For total RNA, resuspend in 0.2M LiCl and precipitate in 2.5 vol of 
ethanol.
