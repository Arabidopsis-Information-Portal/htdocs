Postdoctoral position in flowering time regulation 

The Michaels lab is seeking a postdoc to study the molecular basis of 
flowering-time regulation in Arabidopsis 
(http://www.bio.indiana.edu/faculty/directory/profile.php?person=michaels). 
A strong background in genetics and molecular biology is 
required. Experience with flowering, light signaling, and/or hormone 
signaling is preferred. Indiana University is an exceptional 
environment for plant molecular biology. Our laboratory is housed on 
the third floor of Myers Hall along with four other laboratories that 
also use Arabidopsis as their primary model organism. This provides a 
thriving and vibrant environment for research. Funding is available 
for up to four years. Interested parties should email a cover letter 
outlining interests, complete CV, and contact information for two 
individuals willing to supply letters of recommendation to 
michaels(at)indiana.edu.
