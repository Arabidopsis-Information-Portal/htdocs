	The incorporation of 8-azaadenine (2 x 10E-5 M) to the aseptic culture medium shortened the time required for developing microscopically visible flower primordia and the number of leaves appearing before the first flower buds to about half under 8 h daily illumination in both wild type and a late monogenic mutant.  In the presence of equimolar amount of adenine the flowering was not accelerated by the analog.<p>
