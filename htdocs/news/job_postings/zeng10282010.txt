PhD studentship on the molecular biology of plant pathogen interactions

A PhD studentship with support for at least four years is available immediately (the earliest 
admission time will be Spring 2011) in Applied Bioscience in the Zeng lab at the Biology Department 
of University of Arkansas at Little Rock (UALR).  The Zeng lab is studying the roles of 
ubiquitination in the regulation of plant-microbe interactions with an emphasis on non-canonical 
ubiquitinations.  Our research utilizes the tomato-Pseudomonas syringae model system to identify key 
mechanisms underlying plant immunity against bacterial pathogen infections.  For more information, 
please see http://ualr.edu/biology/.  Suitable candidates should be highly motivated, demonstrate 
originality and independence in their work, and show a record of achievement in their undergraduate 
study (and graduate study, if applicable).  Applicants with any of the following qualifications will 
be highly preferred: (1) Has experience in the study of plant-microbe interactions; (2) Has 
background in molecular biology and biotechnology; (3) Has good technical writing skills; and (4) 
hold a Master's degree or equivalence in plant biology-related disciplines.  Qualified applicants 
should submit an email message (with "Ph.D. position" in the subject line) containing a cover letter, 
academic transcript from relevant undergraduate  / graduate (MS) degree, TOEFL (international 
applicants) and GRE scores, and CV, including contact information for two to three academic 
references, to lxzeng@ualr.edu.
