Redei and Acedo (1976) have reported that Arabidopsis plants flowered
and even set fruits under the conditions of complete darkness on
liquid media. On the contrary, Kranz (1979) has failed to yield
flowers on the liquid media under complete darkness. The aim of
present study was to investigate the conditions for flower induction
under darkness.<p>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<p>

Germination: The line Estland, En2n and Sen of Arabidopsis thaliana
were used. The line En2n was kindly supplied by Dr. Kranz and line Sen
has been bred in our laboratory. The seed were sterilized with
filtrate of calcium hypochlorite (5%) for 10 min, rinsed 3 times with
sterilized water and sowed on a 15 ml Nitsch's nutrient medium with 3%
sucrose (pH 6.0) (Nitsch and Nitsch, 1967) solidified with 0.8% agar
in a petri dish 24 hr. Then, the planted seeds were irradiated by
white light (about 5000 lux; cool-white fluorescent lamps) for desired
periods for germination, and transferred to darkness (25*degrees*C).<p>

Incubation: After 3 days, 2 seedlings were planted on a 5 ml liquid
medium in a test tube (18 x 180 mm) in which glass beads were
submerged in order to keep the plants not to be under the medium. The
medium was the same as that used in germination (minus agar). The
surface of the meidum comes to about 1 cm over the uppermost glass
beads. The diameters of the beads wre 3, 5 and 7 mm. For the rotatory
incubation, 2 seedlings ere planted on a 5 ml liquid meidum in a test
tube (16 x 160 mm), and the tubes were settled almost horizontally on
a rotator which was turned vertically 7 round per hr. The planting
procedures wee carried out udner dim green lgiht. After 5-6 weeks
incubation in the dark at 25*degrees*C, the umber of the platns
forming flower primordia was observed with a magnifier.<p>

RESULTS<p>

The frequency of flower-induced plants was affected by the size of
glass beads (Table 1).<p>

Table 1: Frequency of flower-induced plants grown on the medium
including various sizes of glass beads and on a rotator in Arabidopsis
thaliana (line Estland). The seeds were irradiated by white light
(about 5000 lux) for 5 hr for germination and allowed to grow in the
dark for 6 weeks.<p>

The plants grown on the large beads (7 mm in diameter) formed flowers
fewer than those on small beads (3 and 5 mm in diameter). The plants
grown on the rotator took markedly vigorous roots, and the inner
surface of the test tube was covered by numerous roots. Table 2 shows
the effect of the period of light irradiation for germination on the
flower induction.<p>

Table 2: Frequency (%) of flower-induced plants irradiated by various
periods of white light (about 5000 lux) for germination in 3 lines of
Arabidopsis thaliana. Irradiated seedlings were allowed to grow on the
medium including glass beads (5 mm in diameter) in the dark for 5
weeks.<p>

The longer the light irradiation was, the greater the frequency of
flowering plants was in all the lines. This result suggests tht the
factor produced by irradiation at the germination period may be
retained several weeks and acted to the flower induction. Light
irradiated intermittently for short periods (3 hr light-24 hr dark-1
hr) on the flower induction (except En2n).<p>

Figure 1 shows the flowering plants and flowers formed under darkness.
The sepals, petals, stamen, pistil, stigma, and anthers were normal at
least in external appearance, but no pollen grain was observed.<p>
