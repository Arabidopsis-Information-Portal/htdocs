Graduate student or post doctoral research associate-

A talented graduate student or post-doctoral researcher is sought to study the fundamental components of
 cell wall biology in higher plants. Interested applicants should have a keen interest in plant biology,
 but please consider this post if you are coming from any area of biomedical, biochemistry, structural
 biology or applied science and looking for an exciting project. The project centers around a collaborative
 project between the University of Kentucky and Cornell University and the applicant will have the chance
 to utilize synchrotron X-ray diffraction to decode cell wall structure. A positive and collaborative
 nature is key as is an undergraduate degree in biology (or related science and preferably a Masters degree
 in a discipline of biological science). Please make inquiries to Seth DeBolt email: sdebo2@email.uky.edu
