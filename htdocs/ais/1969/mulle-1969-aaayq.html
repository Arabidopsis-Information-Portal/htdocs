Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) is known as a penetrant carrier of drugs
through biological membranes (MARTIN et al., 1967). BHATIA (1967) has
shown tht 5% DMSO enhances the mutagenic effect of ethyl
methanesulfonate (EMS) when simultaneously applied to flower buds.
This result is explained by a more rapid uptake of the mutagen.  It
seemed interesting to test the influence of DMSO on the effectiveness
of seed treatments with mutagens.  Presoaked seeds of Arabidopsis
thaliana were treated for 3 hrs at 24*degrees*C with EMS and
N-nitroso-N-methyl-N-nitroguanidine (NMG) dissolved in water or 5%
DMSO respectively.  After treatment the seeds were washed and stored
in water for 6 hrs.  The frequencies of embryonic lethals and
chlorophyll mutations were determined by the embryo test.<p>

We found (see table) that 5% DMSO does not enhance the mutagenic
effect.  In the case of EMS a decrease of mutation frequency was
observed.  It is not known whether in the combined solution reactions
occur which reduce the concentration of the active EMS.  After 3 hrs.
treatment with 50% DMSO (without mutagen) germination of the seeds was
delayed for 7 hrs., but germination rate and survival rate were
normal.  Therefore, it is possible to use DMSO concentrations higher
than 5% which was chosen because of its effectiveness with bud
treatment.<p>
