cover with a wick of 3 sheets of 3MM paper saturated in 20 x SSC. 
  (viii) Place the gel, bottom up, onto the wick removing any air bubbles, 
surround the gel with Parafilm.
  (ix) Cut a sheet of Hybond N membrane to the exact size of the gel, wet 
the membrane in 20 x SSC, and place on top of the gel.  Avoid trapping 
air bubbles.
  (x) Place 3 wetted sheets of 3MM paper, cut to size, on top of the 
membrane.
  (xi) Place absorbent paper towels on top (5 cm deep) cover with a glass 
plate and place a weight on top.
  (xii) Transfer o/n.
  (xiii) Dismantle the apparatus and rinse the membrane with 2 x SSPE.  
Blot excess liquid from the membrane.
  (xiv) Stratalink membrane at energy 2400.
  (xv) Allow membrane to air dry between two sheets of 3MM paper then 
bake under vacuum for 2 h at 80oC.

*  Store at -20oC.

2.  PREHYBRIDISATION 
  (i) Denature 0.5 ml of a 1 mgml-1 solution of Salmon Sperm DNA by 
heating to 100oC for 5 min.  Chill on ice and add to hybridisation solution 
and prewarm at 65oC.
  (ii) Prehybridise membrane in 20 ml of hybridisation solution in a 
hybridisation tube in a rotisserie hybridisation oven for 3 h at 65oC.

3.  PREPARATION OF PROBE
  (i) Take 100 ng of probe DNA and dilute to 20 ul in TE.  Denature probe 
by boiling at 100oC for 5 min, chill on ice for 5 min.
  (ii) Label probe by random priming following Feinberg and Vogelstein 
standard protocol with 50 uCi of 32P dCTP.
  (iii) Denature 100 ng of probe DNA dissolved in 1 x TE to a volume  of 
32.5 ul in a pierced Eppendorf tube by boiling for 5 min in a boiling water 
bath, then immediately cool on ice.
  (iv) Add 10 ul of 5 x OLB, 2 ul 10 mgml-1 BSA, 1 ul 1 unitul-1 Klenow, 
and vortex.
  (v) Spin down mix in microfuge add 5 ul of 32P DCTP.   Mix briefly and 
incubate at 25oC for 3 h
  (vi) Remove unincorporated nucleotide by passing the labelled probe, 
diluted to 100 ul with 35 ul of Orange/Dextran Blue dye, over a 
Sepharose CL-6B spin column.

4.  HYBRIDISATION
  (i) Denature probe by boiling at 100oC for 5 min, chill on ice for  5min.
  (ii) Add probe to 5 ml hybridisation solution, pre-warmed to 65oC.
  (iii) Pour off prehybridisation solution and add probe.
  (iv) Hybridise o/n at 65oC.
  (v) Pour off probe.

5.  WASHES
  (i) Wash membrane 2 times with 100 ml of a pre-warmed solution of 1 x 
SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 65oC for 20 min.
  (ii)  Wash membrane 2 times with 100 ml of a pre-warmed solution of 0.1 
x SSPE,
0.1% SDS at 65oC for 20 min.  Or, alternatively, 2 times in plenty of 5mM 
Na2PO4, 1mM EDTA, 0.2% SDS pH 7.0 for 30 min at r.t.
 *  The latter is more convenient for processing large numbers of filters.
  (iii) Rinse membrane in 2 x SSPE.  Place membrane on 3MM paper 
wetted with 2 x SSPE and wrap in 'Saran wrap' or seal membrane in a 
plastic bag.

6.  AUTORADIOGRAPHY
  (i) Place membrane in an empty cassette, place an Trimax (3M) 
intensifying screen over the membrane, overlay the screen with a Kodak 
X-OMAT AR film, and place a second screen over this.
  (ii) Expose film at -70oC.
 *  A signal should be seen within 3-5 h with a good probe or o/n.

7.  STRIPPING BLOTS FOR REPROBING
  (i) Shake the membrane in a solution of 0.1% SDS at 65oC for 15-20 
min.
  (ii) In the case of a strong signal, shake the membrane in 0.4N NaOH for 
30min at 45oC.
  (iii) Transfer the membrane to 0.2M Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 0.1 x SSC, 0.1% 
SDS for 30min at 45oC.
  (iv) Store the membrane sealed in a plastic bag in 2 x SSPE at 4oC.
