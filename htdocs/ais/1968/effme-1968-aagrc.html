<h2>The behaviour of progenies derived from a "winter annual" natural population of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) HEYNH</h2><p>

It has been shown that in natural populations of A. thaliana a large
variability in developmental characters exists between populations and
often also within them (NAPP-ZINN, 1964; CETL, 1965).  The latter can
be subdivided in the between-plant and within-plant component. The
first step in such an investigation is to study the variability of
both, between and within progenies obtained by natural selfing from
single mother plants of a population.  It has been found by DOBROVOLNA
(1967) that in several populations of the "summer annual" type a high
percentage of progenies showed a higher variation in two developmental
characters than homozygous races and that, therefore, such progenies
can be regarded as heterozygous for these characters.  "Winter annual"
populations have not yet been studied from this point of view.<p>

A winter annual population, HV-3, was used in this experiment.  If
unvernalised seeds were sown only about 7% of the plants were
generative at 25+/-3*degrees*C in continuous illumination, 1250 lux,
after 42 days from germination.  About 6 weeks of vernalization were
needed to have all of the plants generative in the given experimental
conditions. Seeds of single plants were harvested at the locality and
vernalized for 4 weeks at 2+/-1*degree*C.  From 293 harvested plants a
representative sample of 120 progenies was sown without vernalization
in the above experimental conditions, and 89 progenies with sufficient
number of individuals were evaluated.  Among these progenies there
were 59 (66, 3 %) fully vegetative, 24 (27, 0 %) with both vegetative
and generative plants, and 6 (6, 7 %) with > 90% generative plants.
This result shows that in the original population more than 25% of the
plants were segregating in vegetative ("winter annual") and generative
("summer annual") individuals, and that they can thus, be regarded as
heterozygous for the genetic factors determining the winter annual vs.
summer annual character.<p>

It is surprising that the frequency of generative plants in the
original sample (13 in 168; 7.7%) coincides not only with the
frequency of generative progenies (6 in 89; 6,7 %) but also with the
frequency of generative plants in all vegetative and "segregating"
progenies (94 in 1129; 8, 3%).  The chi sq. values were 0,39, P = O,50-0,70, and 0,01, P>0,99, respectively. This finding shows that the
"summer annual" individuals must not represent an independent group
within this "winter annual" population but that the same frequency of
these individuals can be produced by means of segregation of
phenotypically "winter annual" heterozygotes.  The two above facts,
namely, the relatively high percentage of progenies segregating in
"winter annual" individuals in such a "winter annual" population will
be a matter of further studies.<p>
