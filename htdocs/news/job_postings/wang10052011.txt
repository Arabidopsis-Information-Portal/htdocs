Ph. D Student Position in Plant Molecular Biology

A Ph. D. student position is available starting Fall 2012, or a possible 
earlier start date in the Department of Plant Science and Landscape 
Architecture, University of Connecticut. Research of the PI's lab focuses 
on molecular regulation of cellulosic biomass production. We use genetics, 
biochemistry, genomics and molecular biology methods to decipher the 
regulation mechanisms of secondary cell wall biosynthesis, especially how 
three cell wall components, i.e. cellulose, lignin and hemicelluloses, are
 coordinately regulated, and how to apply our findings to improve feedstock
 properties for biofuel production.

Applicants should have a degree in Molecular Biology, Biochemistry or a 
related discipline, with excellent communication skills. Experience on plant
 research, molecular genetics, and traditional biochemistry techniques is a 
plus. Interested candidates should send their cover letter, CV and 3 
reference to huan-zhong.wang@uconn.edu<mailto:huan-zhong.wang@uconn.edu>

University of Connecticut now stands among the top 20 public institutions 
in the nation. UConn's main campus in Storrs is admitting the highest-
achieving freshmen in University history. Student diversity continues to 
increase, as does the number of honors students, valedictorians and 
salutatorians who consistently make UConn their top choice.
