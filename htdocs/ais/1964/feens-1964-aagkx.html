Vol 01:<h2>FEENSTRA, W.J.</h2><h2>Genetical investigations with induced biochemical mutants</h2>

Biochemical mutants were induced by treatment of seeds with
ethylmethane sulfonate.  Of the total of seedings, growing on sterile
mineral media, in M2 as many abnormal ones as possible were raised on
a "complete" medium.  In M3, and, if necessary in following
generations, it was tried to establish the specific requirements of
the mutants obtained.  In this way it could be established with
certainty, that 8 mutants were deficient for thiamine production; four
of these grew if the pyrimidine part of the molecule was added to the
substrate, one needed the thiazole moiety, whereas three only grew
when the complete vitamine was given.<p>

Tests of allelism were carried out by making the heterozygous
combinations of the different mutants.  As could be expected, always a
non-deficient F1 resulted when mutants, having different requirements,
were crossed.  Within the thiamine group two different loci could be
established.  The pyrimidine group has not been completely
investigated as yet; the situation, however, seems somewhat
complicated, as two mutants, if crossed with a third one, both yielded
a deficient F1, but if crossed with each other gave a non-deficient
offspring.  Possibly, adjacent cistrons and deletions of different
size play a role here.<p>

Next to the thiamine mutants, it may be that a few mutants were
obtained in which the biosynthesis of uracil, phenylalanine or
nicotinic acid is blocked.  Further study is needed.<p>

In view of the relatively numerous occurrences of thiamine deficiency
it was decided to select more particularly for this kind of mutants.
In the M2 plants are selected based on their phenotype when growing on
mineral medium (lack of chlorophyll in the first leaves), and then
raised on a thiamine containing substrate.  In the M3 it is tested
whether true mutants are obtained, and, if so, what is their specific
requirement.  In this way 9 pyrymidine-less, 5 thiazole-less and 2
thiamine-less mutants have been obtained.  At the moment allelic
relationships among these are being studied; at the same time the
search for more mutants of this kind is continued.<p>
