Post-Doctoral Research Associate
Department of Biology, University of York, U.K.

Post-translational regulation of cell physiology by the circadian clock

A position is available for a highly-motivated post-doctoral research associate in the laboratory of 
Dr. Antony Dodd, to investigate the post-translational regulation of cell function in Arabidopsis by 
the circadian clock.

The aim of the BBSRC-funded programme is to identify mechanisms and systems by which the circadian 
clock enhances plant productivity, stress tolerance and nutrient use by focusing on the circadian 
organization of the proteome and phosphoproteome.

This position represents an excellent opportunity to work in a creative academic environment on a 
cutting-edge project that involves state of the art proteomics technologies. Applicants should have 
a PhD in the plant molecular sciences and have a proven track record of research success leading to 
publication.

The post is available from 1 April 2011 for up to 36 months. Salary will be within the range £28,983
to £35,646 per annum.
