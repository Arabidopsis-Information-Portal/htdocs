Abstract<p>

The effect of fast neutrons and X-rays (in the presence or absence of
dithiothreitol) on the absolute and relative frequency of eceriferum
mutants in Arabidopsis is studied. It is found that there are
significant differences (p < 0.01) in 'group' mutability between the
mutant spectra induced by X-rays and fast neutrons. It is shown that
fast neutrons induce relatively more eceriferum mutants than X-rays,
and that this difference is consistent over several irradiation doses.
For the -SH radioprotector DTT, no effect on the relative frequency of
eceriferum mutants is found.<p>

Introduction<p>

Research into the specific effects of mutagens in higher plants, in
terms of mutant spectra, has mainly concentrated on the comparison
between ionizing radiation and alkylating agents. Extensive data on
chlorophyll mutants as well as viable mutants demonstrated significant
differences in 'group' mutability between the two types of agents in
Arabidopsis (McKelvie, 1963; Robbelen, 1962), in barley (Ehrenberg et
al, 1958; Gustafsson, 1963; Nilan and Konzak, 1961) and in rice (Rao
and Gopal-Ayengar, 1964). Differences in 'group' mutability between
X-ray and fat neutron induced mutant spectra have been demonstrated in
barley for the different phenotypes of chlorophyll mutants (Ehrenberg
et al, 1958; Conger and Constantin, 1974) and for the relative
frequency of erectoides mutants among the total number of viable
mutants (Ehrenberg et al, 1958; Conger and Constantin, 1974) and for
the relative frequency of erectoides mutants among the total number of
viable mutants (Ehrenberg et al, 1958). Genetic analysis of induced
erectoides and eceriferum mutants in barley revealed, within these
mutant classes, specificity in the mutability of individual loci, and
a significant mutagen specificity of sulfonates, ethyleneimine,
X-rays, gamma-rays and fast neutrons for some loci (Persson and
Hagberg, 1969; Lundqvist, 1975; Lundqvist and Wettstein, 1962;
Lundqvist et al, 1968).<p>

Although Gustafsson (1963) and McKelvie (1963) reported that the
difference in mutant spectrum between alkylating chemicals and
radiation in barley and Arabidopsis was similar for several 'mutagen
dose' levels, other data show that apart from experimental conditions,
also the mutagen dose differentially affects the (chlorophyll) mutant
spectrum (Conger and Constantin, 1974; Gaul, 1964; Nilan, 1964). These
factors have mostly not been taken into account in work on mutagen
specificity.<p>

Like in barley (Lundqvist and Wettstein, 1962), mutants with reduced
or absent wax coating are common among the induced viable mutants in
Arabidopsis (Dellaert; unpublished). The present study about the
effect of X-rays and fast neutrons - both in the presence or absence
of dithiothreitol (DTT) - on the absolute and relative frequency of
eceriferum mutants in Arabidopsis is executed in order to: 1. extend
the data about X-ray and fast neutron mutagen specificity, 2. study
the effect of mutagen dose on mutagen specificity, 3. study the effect
of DTT on the induced mutant spectrum.<p>

Material and Methods<p>

After 5 days on wet filter paper at 2 *degrees*C (to break dormancy)
and redrying on filter paper (24 *degrees*C, 24 hours) seeds of
Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Landsberg, mutant 'erecta' were submerged
in tap water or DTT-solution (1.2%), at 22 *degrees*C, 3 hours before
irradiation. Different X-ray doses, such as 140, 233, 327 and 420 Gy
(10 Gy = 1 Krad) were applied to seeds submerged in tap water,
likewise 280, 467 653 and 8409 Gy were given to seeds submerged in
1.2% DTT. The irradiation was carried out with a MG 301 X-ray machine
with a MCN-420 tube, operating at 320 kVp and 10 mA, with an
additional filter of 0.25 Cu and 1.0 Al and with a dose rate of 4
Gy/min. Fast neutrons (20, 33, 47 and 60 Gy to seeds submerged in tap
water; 40, 67, 93 and 120 Gy to seeds submerged in 1.2% DTT) were
given in the irradiation room of the BARN (Biological Agricultural
Reactor Nethrlands, Wageningen) with a dose rate of 1 Gy/min. The
gamma-contamination was only approximately 3%, on a Gy basis. The
maximum duration of irradition was 3.5 hours. In order to equalize
the environmental conditions, the seeds for all treatments were kept
submerged during 6.5 hours at 22 *degrees*C. In total 18 different
treatments (including the controls) were given (Table 1). The X-ray
and fast neutron doses applied - both in the presence or in the
absence of DTT - induced approximately comparable levels of genetic
damage, i.e. M1-ovule sterility, M2-embryonic lethality, frequency of
chlorophylls and viable mutants (Dellaert, 1979).<p>

Subsequent to irradiation the seeds were rinsed with tap water (5 min)
and sown (equally spaced) on perlite saturated with a standard
nutritional solution and put to germinate at 24 *degrees*C under
continuous illumination by fluorescent light tubes, 8000 lux/cm2.
After 8 days the seedlings were transplanted into soil in an
airconditioned greenhouse. The culture medium and culture conditions
used were as described by Feenstra (1965), and Oostindter-Braaksma and
Feenstra (1973).<p>

In the M1-generation Muller's embryo test (Muller, 1961 and 1963) was
applied to silique number 5 or 6 of the main inflorescence, for
scoring M1-ovule sterility, M2-embryonic lethals and chlorophylls
(details about the results will be published elsewhere). Viable
mutants were scored in the M2-generation, by means of testing the
progeny of one silique per M1-plant from the top of the main
inflorescence (to avoid chimerism). In the M1 only well filled
siliques were harvested, in order to (1) increase the germination
frequency of M2-seeds (2) increase the fertility in the M2-generation,
and (3) decrease the number of deviant M2-plants caused by chromosomal
aberrations (Muller, 1966; Mesken and van der Veen, 1968). Viable
mutants in the M2-generation were defined as plants showing deviations
from wild type in plant morphology and/or leaf colour. Among
these, plants with visually reduced or absent epicuticular wax from
siliques and/or stems were defined as eceriferum mutants. Initially
also plants with glossy rosette leaves were included in this class.
However, because ultrastructural analysis of the wax coating on leaves
of the wild type revealed very limited wax deposition (Dellaert et al,
1979) it was decided to classify mutants with glossy rosette leaves in
a separate mutant class.<p>

The mutant frequency (m) for chlorophyll mutants, eceriferum mutants
and total number of viable mutants, has been expressed as the mutation
frequency per cell (Gaul, 1957). For the segregation ratio of
recessives (f), the value of 0.20 has been used. A confidence interval
for m has been calculated by means of a formula derived by STAM
(Dellaert, 1979).<p>

Results and Discussion<p>

In total 36 M2-lines segregated for eceriferum mutants (i.e. 16
induced with neutrons; 11 induced with neutrons + 1.2% DTT; 5 induced
with X-rays; and 3 induced with X-rays + 1.2% DTT). In the
M3-generation selfed progenies of viable M2-mutants and normal
'sister' plants have been grown in order to confirm the mutant type.
Among the latter, 5 more (independent) eceriferum mutants were
isolated. These 5 mutants escaped detection in the M2-generation (due
to small progeny size) and are not included for the calculation fo the
mutation frequency. The phenotype description of the isolated
eceriferum mutants in Arabidopsis and the data about mutants in
Arabidopsis and the data about mutagen, dose and the conditions of the
treatment by which the mutations are induced, are given elsewhere
(Dellaert et al., 1979).<p>

Table 1: Comparison between irradiation treatments - X-rays and fast
neutrons - in the presence or absence of dithiothreitol (DTT), on the
frequency of chlorophyll mutants, viable mutants and eceriferum
mutants in Arabidopsis.<p>

In Table 1 the calculated mutation frequencies per 100 cells (m) for
chlorophylls, viable mutants and ecriferum mutants are presented. It
is observed that in general the eceriferum mutant frequency is higher
after fast neutrons than after X-rays. It has been calculated that
with fast neutrons the average eceriferum mutation rate per Gy per cell
is about 16 times higher than with X-rays. For chlorophylls and
viable mutants, the average mutation rate per Gy per cell is only
about 6.4 times higher with fast neutrons than with X-rays. A rank
test (White, 1952) shows that in the dose range studied the ratio
eceriferum mutants/viable mutants and the ratio eceriferum
mutants/chlorophyll mutants are significantly larger (p<0.01) among
fast neutron induced mutants than among X-ray induced mutants (Table
2). With a similar rank test no significant effect of DTT on these
ratios is found.<p>

Concerning the ratio eceriferum mutants/chlorophyll mutants, it is
noted that the chlorophyll mutants are scored in silique number 5 and
6 of the M1-main inflorescences, while the eceriferum mutants are
scored in M2-progenies of well "filled" siliques from the top of the
M1-main inflorescences. Therefore, the ratio eceriferum
mutants/chlorophyll mutants might be influenced by differences in
mutagen sensitivity between the "initial" cells which form the
sporopytic tissue of siliques no. 5 or 6 and the "initial" cells which
form the sporophytic tissue of the well "filled" siliques in the top
of the inflorescences. This does not apply to the ratio eceriferum
mutants/viable mutants, since both types of mutants are scored in the
same M2-population.<p>

The relatively low number of X-ray induced eceriferum mutants, 8
independent mutants among the 659 X-ray induced viable mutants, is in
accordance with McKelvie's results (1963). McKelvie found no
eceriferum mutants among 427 (independent) X-ray induced viable
mutants. It should be noted that, seeing the phenotype description of
the waxless mutants by McKelvie (1962), in this case only mutants with
(visually) absence of the epidermal wax coating of the stem are
included in the waxless mutant class. In the experiment reported here,
only 3 such X-ray induced mutants are found (Dellaert et al., 1979).
From the 27 fast neutron induced eceriferum mutants, 9 mutants have no
(visually) epidermal wax coating on the stem. The relative frequency
of these eceriferum mutants among the total number of fast neutron
induced viable mutants (i.e., 9 per 684 viable mutants) is comparable
to the relative frequency of eceriferum mutants observed after EMS
treatment (i.e. 7 per 554 viable mutants) by McKelvie (1963).<p>

Table 2: Rank-test (White, 1952) for unpaired measurements after fast
neutron and X-ray irradiation; A. the ratio eceriferum mutants/viable
mutants, B. the ratio eceriferum mutants/chlorophyll mutants.<p>

Koornneef (1979, pers comm.) has used criteria for the classification
of the eceriferum mutants which are equal to the criteria described
here. He observed for EMS induced eceriferum mutants in Arabidopsis
(seed treatment; 10 mM EMS; 24 hrs, 24*degrees*C) a mutant frequency
of 2.3 per 100 cells. This mutant frequency is comparable to the
mutant frequency observed after fast neutron irradiation in this
experiment.<p>

In conclusion, the experimental data reported here, demonstrate
significant differences in 'group' mutability between the mutant
spectra induced by X-rays and fat neutrons in Arabidopsis. It is shown
that fat neutrons induce relatively more eceriferum mutants than
X-rays, and that this difference in mutant spectra is consistent over
several mutagen doses. The data are in conformity with the results
found in barley for differences in X-ray and fast neutron induced
mutant spectra (Ehrenberg et al, 1958; Conger and Constantin, 1974).
Since phenotypic and genetic analysis of the eceriferum mutants in
Arabidopsis (Dellart et al, 1979), indicate that there are at least 14
different cer loci in Arabidopsis, the number of mutants per locus per
mutagen are still too low to pronounce upon mutagen specificity for
individual loci.<p>
