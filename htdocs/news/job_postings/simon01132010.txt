Postdoctoral position to study the role of plant architecture in plant
productivity

A three-year postdoctoral position is available in the laboratory of Prof.
Rudiger Simon at the Institute of Genetics, Heinrich-Heine University,
Dusseldorf, Germany. The project is part of a joined research program
between 17 partners from academia and industry, aiming at crop plant
improvement for generation of renewable energy and chemical resources.

The postholder will investigate the regulation of plant architecture, with a
strong emphasis on meristem functions, in model plant species such as
Arabidopsis, and employ transgenic strategies to modify plant architecture
of crop plant species. Previous experience in plant molecular biology is
required.

The position is funded for three years at the german E13 scale.
