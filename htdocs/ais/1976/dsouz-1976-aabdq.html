The invertases of higher plants have been implicated in a variety of
physiological processes. These include the uptake, metabolism and
acumulation of sugars, maintenance of turgor and cell wall
biosynthesis.  However, over the years there have been several reports
of plant tissue cultures which do not have measurable invertase
activity although they were initiated and maintained on
sucrose-supplemented media. These observations raise serious doubts
about the physiological significance of invertase in growth and
metabolism. An attempt was therefore made to induce and isolate
mutants of Arabidopsis with altered levels of invertase activity.  It
was hoped that investigation of the phenotypic effects of such
mutations could shed some light on the role and importance of
invertase in the organisation and functioning of the whole plant.<p>

M2 families obtained from EMS-treated seeds were examined for mutants
by a screening test for surface invertase activity.  This involves
spraying aseptically-grown seedlings with a 50% sucrose solution
followed by the Glucostat Special reagent which detects free glucose
by specific enzyme reactions (glucose oxidase-peroxidase) coupled to a
chromogen. Wildtype seedlings develop intense red colouration around
the root tips, cotyledons and at the junction of hypocotyl and radicle
indicating high invertase activity in these areas (D'Souza & Maher,
1974a). Lack of colour at the three sites, suggesting a lowered or
absent surface enzyme, was the criterion used to identify possible
mutants.  On this basis two seedlings were isolated from a M2 family
designated 056-S2.<p>

After the screening test the purative mutants and ten members of the
same family were subjected to an in vivo assay for surface invertase
activity (D'Souza & Maher, 1974b). This consisted of immersing
individual seedlings in sterile 2% sucrose and measuring the reducing
sugars formed after a 16 hr. incubation. The controls were a set of
wildtype seedlings of similar lengths whenever possible but generally
they were longer than their M2 counterparts.<p>

Table 1 shows that the S2 seedlings, although comparatively small, had
similar or higher levels of surface invertase activity than the
wildtype.  One of the putative mutants had very low activity, nearly
five times lower than seedling 1 which was of similar length. The
second putative mutant was also very small but it showed a relatively
normal level of surface activity. Both these seedlings were
transferred to aseptic culture but only the confirmed low activity
mutant survived. During 3 months growth it developed a small rosette
but failed to produce an inflourescence. Consequently callus cultures
were initiated from its leaves in order to perpetuate the genotype for
further analysis.<p>

analysis.<p>

The other S2 seedlings were transplanted into soil and showed variable
fertility.  No low activity segregants were detected in the M3
generation but some emorphological variants were observed, indicating
that multiple mutations may have occurred in the single EMS-treated
seed which gave rise to the entire S2 family.<p>

All callus lines were normally maintained on solid B5 medium with
2mg/1 2, 4-D and 2% glucose or sucrose.  For experimental purposes
however, callus was transferred to liquid medium with 2% glucose or 4%
sucrose.  This was due to an earlier finding that Arabidopsis callus
hydrolyses all the available sucrose within a few days and absorbes
the glucose preferentially (Figure 1). Fructose utilization commences
only when the concentration of glucose is down to approximately 0.2%.<p>

Figure 2 shows the utilization of 4% sucrose by four callus lines
including wildtype and S2.  Each point is the mean of three replicate
cultures.  WT, 056-F1, and 013-22 hydrolyse almost all the available
sucrose to reducing sugars by the seventh day after transfer whereas
the S2 line takes fourteen days to achieve the same level of
hydrolysis. Figure 3 shows the difference in the initial rate of
hydrolysis by replicate WT and S2 cultures during the first three days
after transfer to liquid medium. Thus the lower surface invertase
activity, originally detected in the S2 seedling by the screening test
and in vivo assay, is also present in callus derived from that plant.
The persistance of the trait suggests that it was the result of a
mutation.<p>

The growth and extracted soluble invertase activity of replicate WT
and S2 callus cultures were measured after 20 days in liquid medium
with 4% sucrose of 2% glucose (Figure 4).  The main levels of
invertase activity in sucrose and glucose grown S2 callus are 3.7
times and 5.7 times lower than those of the equivalent WT tissues.
Despite this difference in endogenous enzyme activity there is no
significant difference in the growth of the two lines in sucrose (P.
05) or glucose (P.2). Biochemical studies on extracted invertase
showed that the WT and S2 enzymes had indistinguishable pH optima and
Km's with sucrose as the substrate.<p>

There are at least two possible explanations to account for this
situation.  Firstly, the wildtype level of invertase may be greatly in
excess of that actually required by the tissue, in which case low
activity variants could continue to metabolise and grow quite
normally.  The second alternative is that invertase (*beta*
fructofuranosidase) may not be essential for metabolism as sucrose can
be hydrolysed by other enzymes, for example *alpha* glucosidase or
sucrose synthetase.  As mentioned earlier, a complete lack of
measurable invertase activity has been reported in callus of diverse
species such as Nicotiana (STRAUS, 1962), reseda, soybean, rose,
waxbean (GAMBORG & EVELEIGH, 1968) and carrot (EDELMAN & HANSON,
1971).  Yet several of these grow equally well when supplied with
sucrose or glucose. This observation led STRAUS to conclude that the
presence of invertase in tissue cultures was purely fortuitous and
probably served no function.<p>

The results described here suggest that this situation may also apply
to organised, differentiated tissues since the mutant seedling, from
which the S2 callus was obtained, managed to develop as far as the
mature rosette stage in spite of its low activity. The slow growth
rate of the plant, its small size and its sterility may have been
related to its low invertase activity, but it is also possible that
they were due to pleiotropic effects of a single mutation or multiple
mutations.  Other invertase variants, particularly null-enzyme ones,
must be studied if we are to understand the physiological role of this
enzyme.<p>
