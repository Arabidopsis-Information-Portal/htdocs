POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN RICE SYSTEMS BIOLOGY

A postdoctoral scientist position to study rice systems biology and ecology is open in the
laboratory of Michael Purugganan at the New York University (NYU) Center for 
Genomics and Systems Biology.  The position is part of large multi-year NSF Plant 
Genome Research Program collaborative project between the laboratory of Michael 
Purugganan, the group of Rich Bonneau at NYU, and the laboratory of Endang 
Septiningsih at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). The postdoctoral fellow 
will undertake a study of global gene expression in rice grown in the field in the 
Philippines using RNA-Seq, and will study the gene networks that are associated with 
ecologically relevant field environmental conditions. The position is an opportunity to 
work at the interface of genomics, plant biology, and ecology, and will include some 
fieldwork at IRRI in the Philippines.  

Applicants should have:
(1) A strong background in plant molecular biology/systems biology
(2) Experience in experimental and computational analyses of genome-wide gene expression
(3) An interest in plant evolutionary and ecological genomics. 

Interested parties can email a CV and names of three references to mp132@nyu.edu 
Applications received before 30 April 2012 will receive full consideration.

Our lab is located in historic and vibrant Greenwich Village in downtown Manhattan in 
New York City.  NYU is one of the world’s leading research universities and the Center 
for Genomics and Systems Biology is housed in a new, state-of-the-art facility with 14 
faculty members who study genomics and systems biology across all kingdoms of life.
