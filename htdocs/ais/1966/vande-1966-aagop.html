	Ten weeks old seeds of Landsberg 'erecta' were treated with EMS (24 h at 24*degrees*C) or X-rays.  Pretreatment was 5 days at +1*degree*C on wet filterpaper (to break dormancy), followed by 24 h drying at 24*degrees*C (prior to EMS) or by 3 h left wet at room T (prior to X-rays).  With all mutagenic treatments mentioned in this note germination and survival to flowering were not much less than control.  In applying MULLER's embryo test, we used siliquas no. 4 and 5, of each M1-plant, for ease of handling on one side of the replum only. Table 1 gives mean number (per half-fruit) of ovules and of ovules fertilized, percentage of seeds which contain embryonic lethals, and percentage of chlorophyll mutants among non-lethal embryos.<p>

	In Table 1, EMS and X-ray doses are compared which give about the same M1-fertility (ov.fert.), and as expected, EMS leads to a much higher mutation frequency than X-rays do.  The main points emerging from this material are illustrated by Table 2.  The % chlorophylls tends to be constant over fertility classes (and so will probably mutants with later expression).  This confirms the findings of GAUL (1963) with preformed barley tillers.  It implies that preselection for fertility in M1 can increase efficiency in mutation breeding, as it does not lead to loss in percentage of the mutants looked for.  In contrast, however, embryonic lethality is clearly correlated with sterility.<p>

	Experiments to analyze the nature of this correlation are underway.<p>

	Another set of current EMS experiments deals with pre- and posttreatment effects, and resulted from a.o. the following preliminary observations.  One year old 'erecta' seeds were given 40 mM EMS for 6 h at 24*degrees*C.  Posttreatment was: a few minutes rinsing and 3 h submers in a bottle of water.  The first part of the pretreatment too was the same for all three items of Table 3, viz. 5 days at +1*degree*C on wet filterpaper (i.e., aerobic), following by drying for 42 or 24 h at 24*degrees*C.  This is in fact a routine procedure applied by us.  The second part of the pretreatment was respectivley "no presoaking", 18 h submers in 5 mm water at +1*degree*C, and 18 h the same at 24*degrees*C.<p>

N.B. Control fertility was 28.7, which is higher than in Table 1, due to different light conditions.<p>

Table 3 suggests that the quantitative spectrum shift at 18 h/24*degrees*C is not the result of water uptake in itself. Secondly, the already high mutant frequency with "no presoaking" is at variance with the results of ROBBELEN (1963).  The cause of this may lie in the first part of our pretreatment.<p>
