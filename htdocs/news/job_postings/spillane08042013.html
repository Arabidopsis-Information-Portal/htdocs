<p>Starting Investigator Research Grant (SIRG) in Plant Genetics &amp;
    Epigenetics</p>
<p>Genetics &amp; Biotechnology Lab, PABC, National University of Ireland
    Galway</p>
<p>
    Applications are invited from suitably qualified candidates to apply to the
    prestigious Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) Starting Investigator Research
    Grant (SIRG) Programme to carry out their research in the Genetics and
    Biotechnology Lab, Plant and AgroBiosciences Research Centre (PABC) at the
    National University of Ireland Galway. A key objective of the 4 year SIRG
    award is to enable those at an early career stage to establish themselves as
    independent researchers. The successful applicant will be a Postdoctoral
    Researcher working on plant genetics and/or epigenetics with between 3 and 8
    years of relevant experience beyond the award of their doctoral degree.
    Prof. Charles Spillane, Head of the Genetics and Biotechnology Lab and the
    Plant and AgriBiosciences Research Centre (PABC) will act as mentor to the
    successful candidate. The SIRG funding programme can provide the successful
    applicant with the opportunity to gain invaluable experience towards a
    full-time academic position including supervisory experience of the
    postgraduate student also supported by the SIRG award. Description The Plant
    and Agricultural Biosciences Centre is an inter-disciplinary cluster of
    researchers, research groups, companies and institutions sharing a common
    interest in fostering and promoting plant and agricultural biosciences
    innovation. See PABC website for further details: <a
        href="http://www.plantagbiosciences.org">www.plantagbiosciences.org</a>.
    The Genetics and Biotechnology Lab of Prof Charles Spillane conducts both
    fundamental and applied research on topics of genetic, epigenetic and/or
    biotechnological interest, using a combination of wet-lab, bioinformatic and
    field based experimental approaches. The lab conducts research on model
    plants (Arabidopsis thaliana) and crop plants, and also conducts research on
    mammalian genetics and epigenetics (e.g. cattle). See Spillane Lab website
    for further details: <a href="http://www.spillanelab.org">www.spillanelab.org</a>.

<p>SIRG Candidate Criteria</p>
<p>
    The ideal candidate will have a strong track record in plant genetics and
    epigenetics, as evidenced by high-impactpublications and/or
    commercialization relevance (e.g. patents, industrial experience).
    Candidates must demonstrate a proven record ofinternationally recognised
    independent research accomplishments. Typical SIRG publication criteria are
    that the applicant must be senior author (first, last or corresponding) on
    at least 3 articles in international peer-reviewed publications AND be a
    named author on an average of at least 1 international peer-reviewed
    publication per year since the award of the PhD (or equivalent). Candidates
    must not hold a faculty position at the time of SIRG application or at the
    start of the SIRG award. The candidate must not hold or have held a
    significant, independent research award of greater than one-year duration.
    In addition, this previous award must not have had a total value in excess
    of €100,000 (or equivalent) direct costs. Personal awards, including student
    and postdoctoral fellowships and travel awards of greater than one-year
    duration are permissible, providing the award was of a value that was no
    greater than €100,000 per year. Candidates notmeeting these criteria will be
    excluded from consideration. Informal enquiries (using the code PABC-SIRG in
    the email subject line) should be directed to Prof. Charles Spillane by
    email (with a CV, indication of 3 referees and 1 page summary/abstract of
    intended SIRG research plan) to: <a

    The closing date for enquiries to Prof. Spillane is 30 August 2013 SFI SIRG
