<h2>Induction of laggards by cultivating Arabidopsis plants on medium with acridine oragne and proflavine</h2><p>

	Acridine dyes, which are known to react with nucleic acids, have received increasing interest as mutagens in microorganisms, but relatively little attention has been given to acridine-induced mutations in higher plants except in barley (D'AMATO, 1950), tomato (BUIATTI and RAGAZZINI, 1966), and Arabidopsis (OVERBECK, 1952/53).  This paper deals with an investigation of the mutagenic activity of proflavine and acridine orange. The plants were cultivated in Petri-dishes on perlite moistened by mineral solutions  which contained the dyes in a concentration range of 1.25 to 623.5 mg/100 ml.  This mode of treatment included conditions for photoactivation by visible light.<p>

	In the M1-generation a slight decrease of germination was observed in the highest concentrations and a delay in development correlated with the given doses. Table 1 shows one aspect of this last effect, with the date of the first flower opening as criterion. The fertility measured by number of seeds per silique was not very much affected.<p>

	In the M2-generation the germination data were of special interest due to the emergence of laggard variants of both lethal and viable types that looked quite similar to those induced by 5-bromodeoxyuridine (JACOBS and BONOTTO, 1967) (Table 2).  By the selection for viable phenotypes we were able to recognize that the ratio of laggards to normal types increased from the M2 to the M5 (Table 3).  The same kind of instability as observed after BUdR treatment. Some typical mutants, e.g., viridis, were also present at a very low frequency (0.3 to 1.2%).  Morphological variants were observed in successive generations, in families containing laggards. The modifications are essentially concerned with the shape of the leaves and their disposition within the rosette.<p>

	It has been reported (LERMAN, 1964) that acridine dyes may act by intercalation between adjacent nucleotides and that they may induce deletions or insertions of nucleotides in the DNA.  They have also been claimed to be very effective in producing cytoplasmic modifications in fungi (JINKS, 1963).  It appears to be very interesting, therefore, that these two acridine derivatives induce the very same type of variants which were found after BUdR treatment and that these variants arise apparently in the same non-random manner.<p>
