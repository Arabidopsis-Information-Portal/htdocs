In higher plants very little work has been done on intralocus
recombination because of the difficulties involved in collecting and
planting hybrid seeds in large numbers to detect the rare
recombinational events.  While NELSON (1957) pointed out the advantage
of using gametophyte characters, e.g., waxy/non-waxy pollen for study
of fine structure of the gene in higher plants, very few such
characters are available.  For most genes we must use sporophytes.
Here ease of getting large populations makes Arabidopsis more
convenient than larger, slower growing plants.  For example viable
leaf color or auxotroph mutants have several advantages for study of
intralocus recombination because viable "wild" green recombinants
(one-half of the expected total) can be easily detected in the F2
seedlings.  It is desirable therefore to have several hundred seeds
per dish.  With this in mind a seeding method has been devised as
follows: (1) Seeds are scattered on a round wax paper disc which is
slightly smaller than the Petri dish and distributed uniformly by a
small brush.  (2) The cover of the Petri dish is removed.  (3) The
Petri dish is inverted over the wax paper and the glass plate.  The
seeds and the wax paper stick to the agar.  (4) The wax paper is
easily detached with the use of forceps from the agar leaving seeds.
(5) Place the cover on the Petri dish. By this method about 500 seeds
per plate can be sown in five minutes and one hundred thousand seeds
were sown in 16.6 hours.  This population size should be large enough
for estimates of the frequency of intralocus recombination to be made.<p>
