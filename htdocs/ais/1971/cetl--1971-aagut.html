<h2> Estimations of heritability in an uniform natural population of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) HEYNH.</h2><p>

In our studies on the variability of some developmental characters of
natural populations of Arabidopsis thaliana, a large majority of 134
population samples was found to be highly variable and only two of
them were found to be uniform showing narrow, continuous, unimodal and
symmetric empirical distributions (CETL, DOBROVOLNA, and EFFMERTOVA,
1969).<p>

As it was stated, the corresponding heritability coefficients in
typical variable populations were relatively high and significantly
different from zero (DOBROVOLNA, 1968; 1969a, b).  Thus, it appeared
to be interesting to study similar relations in the rare uniform
populations.<p>

The experiment was carried out with the population Cha where the mean
number of days to appearance of the flower primordia was 13.1, the
standard deviation was =/- 0.65 days, and the coefficient of
variability 4.9 percent.  Progenies of 42 mother plants were studied
on heritability in the same way as in our cited papers.  The h2 values
were calculated (1) as a regression coefficient of individual progeny
data on repeated maternal ones (DOBROVOLNA, 1968) and (2) as the
intraclass correlation coefficient, W (DOBROVOLNA, 1969).  For
cultivation conditions see CETL, RELICHOVA-DOBROVOLNA, and KRSKOVA,
1970.<p>

In the Table, results obtained in the uniform population Cha are given
together with the earlier results obtained in a variable population
Str.<p>

Table: The estimates of heritability in the number of days to
appearance of the flower primordia in two natural populations, Cha and
Str<p>

The values of b coefficients in both populations are high and
significantly different from zero at P &lt; 0.0001.  But in the uniform
population Cha, this value was even significantly higher than in the
highly variable population Str.  On the other hand, the W values are
similar in both populations.  This result suggests that also in a
uniform population at least a half or more of the phenotypic
differences between individuals are of genetic nature.<p>

According to DOBROVOLNA (1969b), calculated b and W values correspond
to estimates of h2 in narrower sense so that the role of genes in
determining this character may be still higher. Correspondingly, under
estimation must be the larger, the more heterozygous plants with
dominance or interactions are present in the population.  For this
reason, the high b value found in the uniform population Cha is
comprehensible.<p>

It seems that in uniform populations of Arabidopsis relatively the
same amounts of genetic variability can be present as in variable
ones.<p>
