Abstract<p>

Nine races of Arabidopsis thaliana were used in this study, i.e.,
Estland, En, EG-5, Co-1, Po-1, LM-4, C, A 136, and GR 1,4.  Diallel
crosses including reciprocals and selfings were made between the
races.  Plants were grown in sand with five replicates and tested
under 12 environments prepared in a phototron. The environmental
conditions adopted are combinations of two nutritional levels and six
light-temperature conditions.  In one of the two nutrition treatments,
tap water only was given.  Characters measured were fresh weight and
flowering time.  The fresh weight of five random plants sampled from
each race or F1 hybrids were measured weekly from the first week to
the seventh week. The days to flowering was given by the number of
days from germination to the appearance of the first flower. All
measurements were taken on a single plant basis, and the mean values
for five plants were used for the following investigations.<p>

FLUCTUATION OF HERITABILITY AND CORRELATION OF FRESH WEIGHT BETWEEN
TWO OF THE SEVERAL DEVELOPMENTAL STAGES<p>

Heritabilities were significant only at the flowering time, and the
fresh weight of the first developmental stage.  It decreased rapidly
after the first stage but increased again at the later stages.
Phenotypic corrrelations of fresh weights were inversely related to
the distance between developmental stages, i.e., approached maxima
between two consecutive stages. Correlations between flowering time
and fresh weight of the first stage and last were positive, but
negative with the third and the fourth. Genotypic correlations showed
slightly positive or negative value between early and middle stages
but were highly positive at later stages.  Canonical analysis was made
for the phenotypic correlation. Second canonical correlation was found
related to the growth curve form using fresh weights.<p>

INHERITANCE OF THE STABILITY OF FRESH WEIGHT AND FLOWERING TIME<p>

The mean expression and linear sensitivity to environments have the
same genetic constitution, such as unidirectional gene action,
dominant effect and heterosis. All of these increases are associated
with growth. Dominant effects included the effects of different
dominant and recessive gene frequencies. Additive genetic variation
was smaller than the nonadditive ones.  So the selection of these two
aspects was limited. The developed and fluctuated genes in growth have
identical tendency in mean expression and their linear sensitivity.
But the heavy fresh weight was dominant, and the early flowering time
was recessive. The numbers of dominant genes concerning phenotypic and
linear snsitivity were quite different. The genetic basis of linear
sensitivity and mean expression of character were different and
dependent upon the environments considered. Each gene system determine
the character and its linear sensitivity.<p>

The developmental stability of fresh weight was heritable, but it was
controlled mostly by the dominant effect, therefore, the heritability
was also very small. The unstable development was controlled by the
dominant genes. The unequal gene frequencies of dominant and recessive
of the parental races was partly contributed to the dominant
variation. The degree of dominance was significantly different among
the parental races.<p>
