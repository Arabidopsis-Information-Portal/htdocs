The Joint BioEnergy Institute (JBEI) is a new multi-organizational research center 
comprising world-class resources and expertise located in one facility at Emeryville, 
California. The goal of JBEI is to use rapidly advancing scientific techniques, such as 
systems and synthetic biology, to accelerate development of the nation's biofuels 
industry. JBEI is a U.S. Department of Energy funded Bioenergy Research Center, 
managed by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. 
 
The Feedstocks Division (Plant Biology Section) at JBEI is looking for suitable 
candidates to undertake research into plant cell wall biosynthesis. Research projects 
include the isolating and analyzing subcellular compartments and protein complexes in 
the biosynthesis of plant cell walls; analyzing subcellular compartments using proteomic 
techniques; profiling cell walls using combinations of microscopy and available advanced 
imaging technologies; profiling mutants using metabolomic, transcriptic and proteomic 
techniques.
