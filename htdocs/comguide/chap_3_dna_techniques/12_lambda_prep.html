*  In response to Charlie Hussey's request for information on preparing 
lambda DNA from Elliot Meyerowitz's RFLP clones, we've had good 
success in obtaining nice yields of digestable DNA with the procedure 
described below (This protocol was on the "a-mail" bulletin board; December,
1990): 

1.  SOLUTIONS
  (i) NZCYM (l-1)
10 g NZ amine (casein hydrolyzate, type A)
5 g NaCl
5 g yeast extract
1 g casamino acids
2 g MgSO4.7H2O
pH 7.5

  (ii) SM (l-1)
5.8 g NaCl
2.0 g MgSO4
50 ml 1M Tris (pH 7.5)
2% gelatin

  (ii) NUCLEASE SOLUTION (ml-1)
5.0 ml glycerol
0.1 ml 3M NaOAc
H2O to 10.0 ml
50 mg DNAse I
50 mg RNAse A

2.  PROCEDURE
  (i) Grow suitable host (e.g., LE392) on plate.  Inoculate colony to 
NZCYM and make an overnight culture.  Transfer 1/1000 to 100 ml 
NZCYM, and grow to OD600=0.2.  Pellet cells, resuspend in 20 mM 
MgSO4 to OD600=1.0.  Cells are usable for two weeks at 5oC.
  (ii) Combine 0.5 ml cells with lambda stock.  Use 5x104 to 105 pfu of 
concentrated phage, or if from plates, elute plugged plaque into 1 ml SM 
for at least 2 h and use 10-100 ul of that as inoculum.  Incubate at 38oC 
for 30 min.  Then combine this with 37 ml NZCYM in a 250 ml Erlenmyer 
or Magenta pot.  Shake overnight at 38oC.  Complete lysis should be 
evident, with clots of cellular debris.
  (iii) Transfer culture to an Oak Ridge tube containing 100 ml CHCl3 and 
mix well.  Add 370 ul nuclease solution and incubate at 37oC for 30 min.  
Add 2.1g NaCl and dissolve.  Spin 20 min at 7,000rpm; slow 
deceleration, angle head rotor.
  (iv) Transfer supenatant to fresh Oak Ridge tube containing 3.7 g PEG 
(6-8,000) and dissolve gently.  Set on ice for 60 min.  Preheat 65oC 
bath.
  (v) Pellet phage at 7,000rpm 20 min (5oC).  Gently resuspend pellet in 
0.5 ml SM containing 50 ugml-1 RNAase A.  Transfer to 1.5 ml 
Eppendorf.  Incubate at 37oC for 10 min.  Add 0.5 ml CHCl3, and mix 
gently but thoroughly.  Spin 5 min in microfuge.
  (vi) Transfer supernatant to fresh tube containing : 
20 ul  0.5M EDTA 
5 ul  20% SDS 
10 ul proteinase K (2.5 mgml-1).
Incubate 65oC for 30 min.
  (vii) Extract with phenol, then chloroform isoamyl alcohol (24:1).  Re-
extract with chloroform isoamyl alcohol.  Transfer final supernatant to a 
tube containing 170 ul 6M ammonium acetate.  Add 0.7 ml isopropanol.  
Cool 10 min (-70oC) to 30min (-20oC), and pellet 8 min.  Wash with 70% 
ETOH, vacuum dry, resuspend in 200 ul TE. 
  (viii) Yields are sufficient that a labelling reaction using 4 ul of phage 
DNA makes good probes.

*  Problems are usually due to too high or too low a level of inoculation. If 
the cultures are turbid after overnight growth, then increase the phage 
(cells reached stationary phase before phage caught up to them).  If the 
cultures are cleared, but not especially viscous, and with little cellular 
debris, then lower the phage inoculation (lysis prior to good cell growth).
