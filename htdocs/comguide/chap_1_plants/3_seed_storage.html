*  Harvest seed from yellow brown pods.  For mass harvesting, stop 
watering plants after the first pods are beginning to turn brown.  Allow 
the plants to dry out.  Gently tap the dried plants onto a sheet of paper 
and collect the seed.  Sieve the harvested seeds to remove pods and 
plant debris.
*  Arabidopsis seeds should be viable for two years in seed packets at 
room temperature.
*  High humidity is detrimental for viability (certain mutants may have a 
shorter shelf life).  To increase shelf life, store seed packets over silica 
gel in a sealed sandwich box.

*  For longer term storage, place seeds in Nalgene Cryovials (see 
method below) or ampoules.  Place into a dessicator above self 
indicating silica gel for 4-7 d under a moderate vacuum.  The seeds can 
now be stored in either of two ways:

1.  CRYOVIAL STORAGE (Thanks to A.R. Kranz, AIS)
  (i) Fill about the third of the volume of a Nalgene Cryovial with self 
indicating silica gel.  Cover  this with a plug of non-absorbant cotton wool 
and this with a tightly fitting disc of filter paper.
 *  The self indicating silica gel changes colour from blue to red when 
moisture is absorbed.

  (ii) Add seeds to the vial and dessicate as described above.
  (iii)  Cap the vial, label, and put in a numbered slot of a Nalgene 
Cryobox.
  (iv) Store at -20oC.
  (v) Before removing seeds, allow the vials to warm to r.t. in a dessicator 
above silica gel.
  (vi) After removing some seeds, briefly dessicate the remaining sample 
and return to storage.

2.  VACUUM STORAGE - FOR LONG TERM SEED STORAGE
 *  Effective with Landsberg erecta.  Currently under test with other lines 
and mutants.

  (i) Constrict a 0.5 ml freeze-dry ampoule approximately 1/2 way along its 
length under a mixed gas and air flame.
  (ii) Add the required amount of dessicated seed (as above) and a paper 
label if required.  Plug  the ampoule above the constriction with non 
absorbant cotton wool [to prevent loss of seeds during stage (iii)].
  (iii) Place the ampoule on a nozzle of a centrifugal freeze dryer (e.g., 
Edwards Speedivac) and pull a vacuum of 0.5 torr.
  (iv) At this point, seal the constricted part of the ampoule using a butane 
microjet blowtorch, leaving a sealed tube containing the seeds.
  (v) Store the ampoule at r.t., 4oC or -20oC.  
 *  We don't know yet which of these temperatures is the best for long 
term storage.  Landsberg  erecta shows 100% germination after storage 
for 3 months at any of these temperatures.

  (vi) When the seeds are required from storage, allow the ampoule to 
warm to r.t. and open with a file.

3.  NOTE ADDED
*  In our hands the storage of seeds above dessicant is fine, but we are 
picking up rumours (no hard evidence) that it may be detrimental to 
certain seed lines to store them over several years in this way.

*  An alternative procedure is to dessicate seeds as described and then 
store them in cryovials without dessicant.  At -20oC seeds should be
