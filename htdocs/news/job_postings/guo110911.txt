Research Directions 

My group has been investigating the molecular mechanism of ethylene signal 
transduction and interplays of multiple phytohormones during growth, 
development and leaf senescence in the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana. 
Meanwhile, we are exploring new routes and integrating systems biology 
approaches to illustrate phytohormone signal transduction and regulatory 
network. For more information, please visit our website: 
http://www.bio.pku.edu.cn/lab/guohw_lab/. 



We are seeking a Ph.D. or postdoctoral fellow that will be offered as an 
assistant or associate investigator. We will provide internationally 
competitive salary and benefits according to applicant's qualification. 



Qualification: 

A Ph.D. degree in biochemistry, molecular biology, plant biology, genetics, 
or closely related fields is required. A few years of postdoc training is 
preferred but not required. Suitable candidates should work proactively and 
have strong responsibility. Candidates should also possess good English 
skills in scientific writing and presentation. 



Responsibility: 

The obligations include undertaking independent research, supervising and 
training students and technicians, engaging in other research-associated 
tasks such as manuscript writing and funding application. 



Application: 

Please send one electronic document including your curriculum vitae, a 
statement of research experience, and contact information of three 
referees, to Dr. Hongwei Guo (hongweig@pku.edu.cn).
