 
Independent Research Fellowships 
 
 
 
The John Innes Centre (JIC), Norwich, UK is a world leading centre of 
excellence in plant and microbial sciences based on the Norwich Research 
Park. We are inviting applications from outstanding researchers who 
either hold, or wish to apply for Independent Research Fellowships, to 
attend a Conference at the JIC on 2/3 June 2008. At the meeting you will 
be able to present a talk about your proposed area of research and to 
discuss your proposals, the development of your group and your future 
career plans in depth with senior JIC Scientists. 
 
 
 
After the Conference we will select and mentor outstanding candidates in 
writing Fellowship applications and/or offer the opportunity to move 
existing Fellowships to the JIC.
