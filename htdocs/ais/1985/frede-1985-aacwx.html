INTRODUCTION<p>

In the course of a study of some characteristics of growth physiology
in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. it became necessary to prepare and
examine parts of plants using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). A
part of this work involved modification of techniques employed in
dehydration prior to critical-point drying routinely employed in the
preparation of tissue specimens for observation with the SEM. These
modifications include a rapid water removal technique using acetone in
place of amyl acetate and embedding in Paraplast (a little-used
technique). The present report describes these modifications in
technique and represents some photographic illustrations which were
obtained.<p>

MATERIAL AND METHODS<p>

Specimens for these illustrations were obtained as follows: seeds of
Arabidopsis thaliana race Landsberg erecta wild type were sown on
medium composed of Hoagland's nutrient solution made semi-solid with
0.75% agar (Fender and Schmid, 1981) and contained in plastic petri
dishes. All solutions were prepared using demineralized, distilled
water and no special procedures were employed to obtain sterile
cultures. When the seedlings were 5-7 days old, they were transferred
to 25 x 200 mm, cotton stoppered, glass culture tubes containing 10 ml
of the same nutrient medium. They were kept in a controlled
environment culture chamber at 25*degrees*C under continuous
illumination. Light was provided with 4 Westinghouse F40 cool-white
fluorescent lamps and 4 100-Watt incandescent lamps (Schmid and
Schmid, 1984):<p>

General Preparation of Specimens<p>

When the plants were 4-6 weeks old they were cut into pieces and
immediately fixed in FAA (formalin, acetic acid, ethanol; 1:1:9).
After fixation, the stems, roots, and flowers were washed in 70%
ethanol several times to remove residual formalin and acetic acid.
Then some tissues were sliced with a sharp razor blade to obtain cross
sections or oblique sections of stems or roots. Dehydration of the
tissues was then accomplished using one of the three methods described
below.<p>

The first method involves gradual dehydration with ethanol in a series
of solutions (70%-95%-100%-100%; 15-20 minutes each). After
dehydration in ethanol, amyl acetate is substituted for the ethanol by
immersing the specimens in a series of ethanol: amyl acetate solutions
(3:1-1:1-1:3) followed by three changes in 100% amyl acetate (15-20
minutes each).<p>

The second method involves dehydration of the specimens in a series of
graded ethanol/tertiary butanol mixtures and then embedding the
specimens in Paraplast (Schedule as per Jensen, 1962). The paraplast
embedded tissues can be cut at any angle without crushing the more
delicate tissues such as phloem and without tearing the tougher
tissues such as isolated vascular bundles and their associated
parenchyma. Removal of the Paraplast is effected by immersion of the
specimens in several changes of xylene followed by several changes of
xylene: ethanol (1:1) and several changes of 100% ethenol. Each change
lasted 15-20 minutes. The ethanol is replaced with amyl acetate as
described above.<p>

The third method involves dehydration of the specimens with acetone
rather than ethanol and amyl acetate. The substitution of acetone for
70% ethanol is accomplished by serial immersion of the specimens in a
graded series consisting of water: ethanol: acetone (1:2:1), ethanol:
acetone (1:1, then 1:3), and finally 100% acetone three times. Each
change lasted 15-20 minutes.<p>

Specimens prepared with each of the three methods described above were
finally dried with a Polaron Model E3000 Series 2 Critical Point Drier
apparatus using liquid CO 2. Dehydrated specimens were difficult to
cut without crushing of delicate structures. Therefore, a few
specimens were simply broken or torn apart after dehydration in an
attempt to obtain internal views of the tissues.<p>

The dried specimens were affixed to aluminum stubs with double-sided
tape and coated for 1.5-4 minutes with gold and paladium in argon
using an International Scientific Instruments (ISI) Model PS2 Coating
Unit. The coated specimens were observed with an ISI Model Alpha-9
Scanning Electron Microscope and photographs made with a Pentax MX
camera with 50 mm macro lens using Kodak Technical Pan film. Film was
developed in Diafine using the recommended procedure.<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

The preparation techniques used in this study permitted examination of
structural features of Arabidopsis organs and cells. Organelles and
cell wall details were made clearly visible as were remains of cell
contents not removed by the washing procedure.<p>

Root hairs were well preserved using acetone as a CO 2-miscible
dehydrating agent (Figures 1 and 2). Little or no collapsing of the
root hairs was observed in those hairs near the tip of the root. Older
root hairs were less well preserved, probably due to their age. The
occurrence of root hairs very close to the root tip is believed to be
a result of culture in an agar medium (remains of which are visible,
intermixed with the root hairs in Figure 1). The foot cap and its
cellular details are clearly visible in Figure 2.<p>

Cell wall structural detail is well visualized in all the specimens;
the Paraplast-embedded specimens show the least evidence of crushing.
Secondary wells, primary helical thickenings, pits, and intercellular
spaces are easily discerned. In several places (e.g., Figure 3) it is
possible to see the layered structure of the secondary wall. The
difference between the helical thickenings of the primary xylem and
the thick wall of the secondary xylem elements is clearly visible in
Figure 3. The alternate pitting pattern of Arabidopsis is also visible
in Figure 3. A scalariform perforation plate (Figure 9) is from a
section of root which appears to have been torn near the secondary
vascular cambium. The thin walls and the presence of protoplasmic
remains behind the perforation indicate the immaturity of the cells.
The figure showing a partial phloem sieve plate (Figure 8) is from
oblique stem section.<p>

A cross section of stem hypodermal tissue (Figure 5) shows what appear
to be chloroplasts appressed to the cell wall. In other,
non-chloroplast-containing cells, structures resembling nuclei can be
seen, again appressed to the cell wall. The surface of the sepal
(Figure 6) displays the anisocytic type of stomata characteristic of
Arabidopsis as well as the markedly-ridged cuticular relief pattern
seen in the green flower parts and the style as well (Benzinger and
Schmid, 1981). In cross sections of leaves (Figure 7), the large,
irregular palisade cells of Arabidopsis are quite apparent as are
large intercellular spaces.<p>

All of the preparation procedures employed provided well prepared
specimens and permitted useable photographs. Each method has some
advantages. Incomplete dehydration can be detected with the amyl
acetate method because of the strong aroma of any residual chemical.
The use of Paraplast embedding permits the sectioning of specimens
without the disruption of tissues which often occurs when freshly
fixed material is cut free hand. The use of acetone as a CO 2-miscible
solvent allows faster dehydration of the specimens and faster
substitution with liquid CO 2 during critical point drying. Complete
removal of acetone is more easily accomplished than complete removal
of amyl acetate. Preservation of cellular detail appears to be the
same with both solvents. The cuticle appears undisturbed by the
preparative process as do cell wall structures.<p>

Fixation in a coagulative fixative such as FAA destroys many cell
structures. Dehydration or substitution with ethanol, amyl acetate, or
acetone removes cell membranes and other lipids. Fixation in
glutaraldehyde followed by post-fixation with osmium tetroxide, lead,
or uranium salts might retain such detail.<p>

SUMMARY<p>

It appears that the modifications of preparation and fixation provide
improved techniques for the investigation of the morphology and
anatomy of Arabidopsis in addition to other microtechnique procedures
allowing the study of cell walls, related structures, and possibly
some organelles.<p>
