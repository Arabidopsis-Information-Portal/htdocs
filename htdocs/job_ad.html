The Arabidopsis thaliana database (TAIR) is seeking full-time database curators to participate in the collection and display of data for research use, the development of a data model for the database, and the development of tools for 
literature curation.  Data types to curate will include experimental data from the Arabidopsis literature, genome sequencing and annotation data, gene and protein data, genetic and physical maps and genetic markers, microarray data, 
phenotype and allele data, and biochemical pathways. 
<P>
Successful candidates will have a Ph.D degree or equivalent, a demonstrated ability for independent, critical thinking and excellent written and verbal communication and teamwork skills.  Prior laboratory experience with Arabidopsis is preferred.  Candidates with some background in biochemistry, evolutionary biology, or systematics are especially encouraged to apply. While the candidate should have basic computer skills such as word processing and navigating the Web, no extensive background in computing is required.  Familiarity with basic UNIX commands, spreadsheets, and commonly used biological research tools such as BLAST and MEDLINE 
searching would be assets.

Qualified candidates should send a resume to:
