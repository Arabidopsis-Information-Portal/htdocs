Various mycotoxins are potent mutagens and carcinogens for mammals as
well as for some prokaryotes. Some of the fungi are also affected
genetically by these fungal toxins whereas others are not susceptible
to them (Ong, 1975). Aflatoxin B 1 is a clastogen for plants (Lilly,
1965; Reiss, 1971) but much less information is available regarding
mutagenesis of mycotoxins in plant cells where these chemicals are
released. Since various mycotoxins are ubiquitous on crops, a so far
rather neglected source of "spontaneous" mutation may need attention.<p>

We have tested with an Arabidopsis assay the mutagenic effects of
aflatoxin B 1 and a trichotecin, and we found the mutation frequency
above the concurrent negative control. (Table 1)<p>

Table 1: Effects of aflatoxin B 1 and T2 mycotoxin on the frequency of
embryo mutations. The values of the concurrent negative control had
been substracted. The signs * and ** indicate that the values shown
are exceeding the 95% and 99% level of significance relative to the
control respectively.<p>
