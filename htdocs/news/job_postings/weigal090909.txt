Several years ago, the Weigel lab discovered that hybrid necrosis, a type of genetic 
incompatibility found in many different plants, also occurs in Arabidopsis thaliana. Even though 
the underlying genetic basis appears to be heterogeneous, a collaboration with the Dangl lab 
established autoimmunity as the common cause. Since our first publication on hybrid necrosis in 
2007 (Bomblies, Lempe et al., PLoS Biology 5, e236), we have cloned several additional causal 
loci. Interesting patterns are emerging for their molecular nature and allelic diversity, and we are 
expanding our biochemical and population genomic analyses of this interesting phenomenon. 
 
 
 
We are looking for additional postdocs and PhD students to join an active team of five postdocs 
and PhD students already working in this exciting area. Postdoc applicants need to have 
published at least one first-author paper in an international journal. PhD students must have a 
Masters degree in a relevant discipline and need to document practical experience in molecular 
genetics, biochemistry, population genetics and/or bioinformatics. 
 
 
 
Apart from members of the Weigel lab, you will interact with colleagues on a joint international 
HFSP grant (with Jeff Dangl [UNC]; Jonathan Jones [Sainsbury Laboratory]; and Michael Doebeli 
[UBC]). You will also benefit from the 1001 Genomes (http://1001genomes.org) resources we are 
generating. Additional information on the group, the institute, and Tübingen can be found on our 
website (http://weigelworld.org). 
 
 
 
Please send applications, with a statement of purpose, at least three names of references, and 
the subject line <arab-gen posting> to
