Last year we reported (REDEI and PERRY, 1971) that Arabidopsis can be
very successfully cultured in shaken or aeriated submerged liquid
medium supplemented with glucose.  Recent experiments have shown
(Table 1) that an appropriate carbohydrate source is indispensable for
growth even under high light intensity. The carbohydrate cannot be
replaced by acetate, and there is an obligate requirement for light
even on sugar containing media.<p>

Table 1: The seed (50/100 ml mineral medium) was dropped after
disinfection in cotton plugged 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks and placed on
a shaker in the greenhouse.  After 12 days the cultures were
harvested.  On sugar-free medium development ceased after germination<p>
