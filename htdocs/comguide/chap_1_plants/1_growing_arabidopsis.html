*  Some people have expressed problems in growing Arabidopsis 
successfully so here is how we do it at Nottingham. However there is no 
substitute for a quick "chat" with your plants every day.

1.  COMPOST
  (i) Compost components: (2 : 2 : 2 : 1):
Irish Moss Peat (Joseph Bently & Sons, Barrow on Humber).
John Innes Potting Compost No.3.
Gravel (Horticultural Potting Grit, Joseph Bently etc.).
Coarse Vermiculite (Vermiperl Medium Grade, Silverperl Ltd.  Albion 
Works, Gainsborough).

2.  PROCEDURE
  (i) Fill a glass Petri dish with approximately 7 g of superfine Silvaperl 
perlite (Silvaperl Products Ltd, Harrogate).
  (ii) Sterilise plates by dry heat (160oC, 2 h).  Once cooled, pipette 10 ml 
of Gamborg's B5 medium (Gamborg, O. L., Miller, R. A.  & Ojima, K. 
(1968) Exp.  Cell.  Res. 50, 151-158. [Sigma Chemical Co., Dorset]) 
evenly over the  surface of the perlite.
 *   As B5 contains thiamine, 1mM KN03 should be used for thiamine-
requiring mutants so that  the marker appears, i.e., bleaching of first 
leaves.

  (iii) Moisten the sealed end of a Pasteur pipette by touching the wet 
perlite, then use this to pick up a seed and place onto the perlite.  Plant 
approximately 40 seeds per plate.
  (iv) Place plates in a controlled area (constant light (1500 lux daylight 
fluorescent tubes), 22 +/-2oC) for 4-5 days or until both cotyledons are 
clearly visible (approximately 5 mm across both tips).
  (v) Using a small spatula dig the seedling out of the perlite and transplant 
to well watered compost (1., above).
  (vi) Put the transplanted seedlings into propagators (keeping the vents 
open) and transfer these into the controlled area until rosettes of leaves 
appear.  The plants can then be taken out of the propagator and moved 
to the greenhouse, where they are kept until the end of their life cycle (4-
8 weeks).
 *  Seedlings can be put into the greenhouse directly if you can rely on 
the control of  temperature and humidity.
