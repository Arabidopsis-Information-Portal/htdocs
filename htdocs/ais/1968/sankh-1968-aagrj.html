Recently certain derivatives of fluorine-9-carboxylic acid
(morphactins), which lastingly influence growth and morphogenesis in
higher plants, have been characterised as novel growth regulators
(SCHNEIDER, 1964).  Like other growth retardants (CATHEY, 1964) these
chemicals can also effectively retard growth, inhibit germination,
delay leaf senescence, and the foliage of the treated plants develop
intense green color (SCHNEIDR, 1964; SANKHLA and SANKHLA, 1967;
HARADA, 1967).  Moreover, as in the case of other growth retardants
exogenously applied gibberellin can also reverse some of the growth
effects of morphactins (ZIEGLER et al, 1966).  However, the apparent
similarity between growth retardants and morphactins ceases at this
point.  Morphactins unlike growth retardants (NINNEMANN et al., 1964)
do not affect gibberellin biosynthesis (TOGNONI et al., 1967; KRELLE
and LIBBERT, 1967) and are known to disturb phototroposm of shoots and
geotropism of roots (KHAN, 1967).  Recently an apparent antagonism
between morphactins and cytokinins has also been recorded (SANKHLA and
SANKHLA, 1967).  No detailed account is yet available on the effect of
morphactins on growth and flowering of higher plants.  In furthering
our knowledge relating to the role of these chemicals in plant growth
we observed that morphactins produce certain striking changes in the
growth habit of the treated Arabidopsis plants; the observations are
summarized in this report.<p>

Plants of A. thaliana, race En-2, were raised in groups of 20 each in
a greenhouse as described elsewhere (SANKHLA and SANKHLA, 1968).  When
the seedlings were 15 days old 20 ml solution of the desired
concentration (ranging from 100 ppm to 500 ppm) of
morphactin-butylester (obtained as a gift from Merck AG, Germany) was
sprayed onto each pot.  A single such treatment greatly inhibited the
extension growth of the main shaft as well as of lateral branches; as
a result the treated plants appeared much dwarfer in comparison to the
controls.  Not only this, morphactin treatment completely released the
dormancy of lateral branches (Figure 1a) and greatly stimulated the
formation of 'secondary rosette leaves'.  These leaves were initially
dark green and extemely hairy, but soon developed an anthocyanin like
pigment on the lower surface, got rolled upwards and simulated a
spatula in their appearance.  As the concentration of morphactin was
increased (100 ppm to 500 ppm) the visible appearance of floral
primordia in the treated plants was slightly delayed.  Of special
interest, however, was that the lateral branches of a few plants under
these conditions frequently indicated various degrees of fasciations
and/or produced-besides normal flowers-flowers that appeared to be
almost double replicas of the normal ones (Figure 1b).  Such flowers
generally developed 8 sepals, 8 petals, 10-12 stamen and two
bicarpellar laterally fused ovaries.  Sometimes even 'triple flowers'
were observed.  It is not clear whether this increase in the number of
floral parts was due to just splitting of the existing primordia or
initials, or was the result of the union of two buds.  Most of these
flowers developed normally and matured into double or triple fruits
that contained perfectly viable seeds.  In contrast, in some of the
flowers developing on 'late' lateral branches either the sepas and
petals were dropped at an earlier stage or these organs as well as
others did not develop at all and the flowers indicated a distinct
tendency towards femaleness.  In addition, following treatment with
morphactin the senescence of the whole plant was greatly delayed.<p>

The results of experiments designed to study morphactin-gibberellin
interaaction indicated that gibberellin effectively reversed the
inhibition of extension growth caused by the former substance, but
remained ineffective in reversing the main effects caused by
morphactin, viz., release of dormancy of lateral buds, formation of
secondary rosette leaves, induction of fasciation in lateral branches
and abnormalities of floral parts. Thus these results appear to
support the earlier postulate (TOGNONI et al., 1967; MANN, et al.,
1966) that gibberellin and morphactin act independently of each other.
As a matter of fact our unpublished results relating to growth and
flowering of Nicotiana suggest that in their mode of action
morphactins probably resemble more to synthetic substances like 2, 4-D
and TIBA.  However, until further experiments have been carried out no
definite opinion can be put forth regarding the exact site of action
of morphactins.<p>
