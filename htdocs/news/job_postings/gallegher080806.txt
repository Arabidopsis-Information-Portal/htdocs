[Arabidopsis] Post-Doc Position Available


Please forward this message on to anyone who may be interested.

A post-doctoral position is available in the laboratory of Dr. Kimberly Gallagher in the Department of 
Biology at the University of Pennsylvania.

Cell-to-cell communication is essential to coordinate developmental events in both animals and plants. 
In plants, cell-to-cell signaling is possible through direct transport of transcription factors between 
cells. Recently direct trafficking of macromolecules has also been described between animal cells by 
Rustom et al. (Science (2004), 303;1007-1010 ). Likewise, plant transcription factor movement between 
animal cells in culture has been demonstrated (Tassetto, et al. Embo Rep. (2005), 6, 9, 885-890), 
suggesting conserved mechanisms for cell-to-cell transport.

This position is to study the mechanisms by which transcription factors move between cells in the 
Arabidopsis root. Of particular interest are the mechanisms that regulate SHORT-ROOT (SHR) transport. 
Movement of SHR has been shown to be actively regulated and developmentally relevant. Further, five 
additional transcription factors from distinct families have also been shown to traffic between cells 
in the root. The qualified candidate would characterize movement of these transcription factors and 
determine their role in root development. Individuals with experience in molecular biology and confocal 
microscopy are strongly encouraged to apply.
