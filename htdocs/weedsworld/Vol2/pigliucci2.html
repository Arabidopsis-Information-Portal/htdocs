The univariate and multivariate study of variation for phenotypic
plasticity (i.e., the ability of a genotype to produce different
phenotypes in response to distinct environments) is central to
providing a clear understanding of hypotheses about the genetic
control and evolution of reaction norms in natural populations.
Arabidopsis thaliana is an ideal organism for the study of
Genotype x Environment interactions (i.e., genetic variation for
plasticity), because of the ease with which it can be grown in
large numbers and due to the amount of information already
available on its genetics, physiology and developmental biology.
In this paper, we report on the plasticity, genetic variation and
GxE interactions of four populations of A. thaliana in response
to three environmental gradients (water, light and nutrients),
each characterized by four levels of the controlled parameter. We
measured nine traits and obtained their reaction norms. Path
analysis was used to study the plasticity of character
correlations. We found a tendency for A. thaliana reaction norms
to be linear (either flat, i.e.,no plasticity, or with a
significant slope), in accordance with previous studies. We
detected substantial amounts of genetic variation for plasticity
in the light and nutrient gradients, but not in the water
gradient. Dramatic restructuring of character correlations was
induced by changes in environmental conditions, although some
paths tended to be stable irrespective of the environment,
thereby suggesting some degree of canalization.
