ARNOLD (1964) and ARNOLD and CRUSE (1968) reported on experiments of
induced androgenesis in Arabidopsis.  Quantitative information has not
been published yet, however.  The experimental study of apomixis is of
considerable interest in plants both from pure biological viewpoint
and also for applied purposes in crop plants.<p>

The actual frequency of gynogenetic apomixis is extemely difficult to
determine because a large number of the maternal embryos are
diploidized at an early stage. Thus accidental selfing can be ruled
out only in the haploid maternal offspring.  Androgenetic plants can
be conveniently produced in some species by pollen cultures
(NITSCH,1969) but to some other species this method cannot be applied
yet.<p>

The frequency of androgenesis undoubtedly depends on genetic factor(s)
in the same species (KERMICLE, 1969).  By the use of appropriate
genetic techniques the recognition of offspring containing only
paternal chromosomes in maternal cytoplasm can be facilitated and
contaminations of various origin can be identified with certainty.<p>

As a female parent we used plants homozygous for the recessive gene
gl1 (hairless) and their cytoplasm was marked with a plastom syndrome
(REDEI, 1971) induced by a nuclear chloroplast-mutator (chm) gene.
The pollen donor plants were homozygous for hy (long hypocotyl) and
either for as (asymmetric rosette leaves) or for re (reticulate leaf
blades) recessive genes, respectively.  All three were located in
linkage group 3 (REDEI, 1965).  The male parents were homozygous
dominant for other factors including chm+ and gl+.<p>

Accordingly all normal diploid biparental offspring was expected to
carry the cytoplasmic syndrome and to be wild type for all the nuclear
markers employed.  Androgenetic progeny was supposed to be variegated,
hairy, with elongaged hypocotyl and to display reticulate or
asymmetric rosette leaves, respectively.<p>

The genetic markers used were very convenient for the studies because
all could be identified generally within two weeks after germination.<p>

Attempts were made to detect the possible influence of extrinsic
factors on the frequency of androgenesis but no significant difference
was detectable under conditions of treatments:<p>

Two of the androgenetic plants appeared diploid and one was possibly a
haploid.  It appears that androgenesis is well detectable in
Arabidopsis but its frequency is low, approximately 1.5 x 10E-4.  In
normal maize the frequency of androgenetic progeny is approximately 8
x 10E-5; in the presence of the genetic factor ig a frequency of 2-3 x
10E-2 was observed (KERMICLE, 1969)<p>
