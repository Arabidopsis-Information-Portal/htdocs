A two-years postdoc position is open for non-french applicants at the 
Laboratoire de Biochimie et Physiologie Moléculaire des Plantes located at 
INRA Montpellier, France. The aim of the work is to investigate auxin 
transport and signalling in Arabidopsis thaliana and Casuarina glauca in 
relation to the regulation of root development by the nitrogen nutrition of 
the plant (mutation in nitrate transporter genes in A. thaliana, or 
formation of N2-fixing nodules in C. glauca). Highly motivated applicants 
with a strong publication record will be considered. The requested 
experimental skills include a solid background in cell and molecular 
biology. A good experience in protein localisation will be an advantage. 
Montpellier is a very attractive city of southern France, with a rich 
academic environment in plant sciences (several universities, many research 
institutions). The position has to be filled by March 2008, and the salary 
will be modulated according to the previous research experience of the 
selected candidate. 
 
For more information on the research program, please contact Dr. Alain Gojon 
(gojon@supagro.inra.fr). This postdoc is part of a collaborative project 
between four laboratories: Equipe integration 
(http://www.bpmp.cnrs.fr/Groupes/Int%E9gration.htm); Equipe Rhizogenèse 
(http://www.mpl.ird.fr/rhizo); Equipe Virtual Plants 
(http://www-sop.inria.fr/virtualplants); and the group of Pr. M. Bennet 
(CPIB, University of Nottingham, UK). 
 
Applications including detailed CV, a brief description of previous work, a 
list of publications and the names of at least two referees must be sent to 
Dr. Alain Gojon (gojon@supagro.inra.fr).
