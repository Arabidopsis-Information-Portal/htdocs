Vol 01S: <h2>X-Ray Induction of Embryonic Malformations</h2><p>

Erna REINHOLZ<p>

Already in my first experiments on the induction of mutations in
soaked seeds, I found among 115 variant X1-progenies 2 families in the
X2-generation showing seedlings with tri-and tetracotyledones. But at
that time the inheritance of these deviations could not be shown
because of technical difficulties. Some years ago, new experiments
were performed on the influence of low temperature during irradiation
(REINHOLZ, 1954a 1965). These again gave progenies of X1-plants with
tri- and tetracotyledonous seedlings. The spontaneous rate of
cotyledonous aberration in the race Enkheim used in these experiments
was as low as 0.2% (REINHOLZ, 1954; cf. NAPP-ZINN, 1955).<p>

From the families showing a constant deviation in the number of
cotyledons in the X3- and X4-generations the mutant "-160*degrees*C
62" was selected for a detailed analysis. It was called "tribolia", as
most frequently three cotyledons were observed. In the following
generation, however, tri-, mono-, hemi-, and tetracotyledonous types
as well as a high percentage of dicotyledonous forms appeared. In
Table 1 the different types in progenies of dicotyledonous plants of
the mutant "trifolia" are summarized. Comparing both columns the
relative number of anomalies seems to be the same in each case.<p>

Table 2 shows the rates of cotyledonous variants within the progenics
of 15 individual plants and of 5 random seed samples of the mutant
"trifolia". While in the first generation (X2) only plants with 3
cotyledons have been selected, di-, tri- and hemicotyledonous plants
have been maintained in the second generation. Among 20 families of
the third generation, summarized in Table 2, the lowest percentage of
aberrations was 6.7 and the highest 13.4. As surely the values range
below 20% the mutant "trifolia" belongs to the so-called "half-races"
of de VRIES (1902). Table 3 reveals the distribution of malformations
within different siliques of an individual plant with 25 siliques at
the main inflorescence. The preceding generations were tri-, di- and
tricotyledonous. As the siliques growing at the lower part of the
inflorescence ripen first in Arabidopsis, they are bettr nourished
than younger siliques growing at the top. STRAUB (1948) investigating
Petunia found that nutrition is an important morphogenetical factor,
as he observed the rate of cotyledonous aberrations in the youngest,
poorly nourished siliques. But in our Table 3 such a gradient is not
to be seen. Just so Figure 1 indicates that the distribution of the
aberrations inside the siliques is random. Summarizing we have to
state that the gene determinating the syn-, di-, tri-, tetra- and
pentacotyledonous as well as transition-types has a penetrance of
below 20% and a variable incomplete manifestation.<p>

The same aberrations in number and shape of cotyledons have been
phenocopied in a high percentage by irradiating whole inflorescences
of Arabidopsis containing embryos at different stages of development
(REINHOLZ, 1959). There was a definite proof that X-rays were
especially efficient on flowers and middle-aged siliques.  Thus the
maximum of the aberrations coincided with the state in which the
siliques show the highest radiation sensitivity.<p>

A wide spectrum of aberration types could be classified in individual
siliques (being irradiated as pods or flowers) e.g.,
anisocotyledonous, unilocular and plurilocular hemitypes,
syncotyledonous including the mono- and tricotyledonous, multiple and
disconnected multiple seedlings. In nearly all siliques a certain
percentage of normal embryos was found, the highest one in the old
siliques and the lowest one in certain stages of the younger siliques.
An accumulation of the aniso-, uni- and plurilocular forms was found
specially in the older siliques. This was not surprising, since these
anomalies were induced at a time when the fundamental shape was fixed
so that only small changes caused by disturbances of growth or cell
division were possible. On the other side after treatment of flowers
and the youngest siliques already syncotyledonous, tricotyledonous and
multiple seedlings have been found.<p>

In progeny tests no accumulation of cotyledonous anomalies as in our
mutant "trifolia" was found. This means that the somatically induced
malformations were not heritable, but a phenocopy of the gene
"trifolia".<p>

Another example of such a phenocopy in Arabidopsis is the appearance
of fasiations. Fasiciation of the inflorescence is a frequently
observed non-heritable malformation in plants irradiated in the
seed-stage (cf. REINHOLZ, 1947). Probably it is caused by an
inhibition of differentiation at the vegetation point followed by the
enlargement and formation of multiple growing-centers stretched en
bloc.<p>

In 1964, I found fasciated forms in an X2-generation after X- exposure
at different temperatures (Figure 2). Meanwhile I tested the X3- and
X4-generations of one of these forms (number -10*degrees*C 242) and
all chequed plants showed the mutant characteristics. The penetrance
was 100%, but the expressivity of the fasciation was variable.<p>

Discussion:<p>

LANGRIDGE: Are these different cotyledon shapes symmetrical and how do
they originate?<p>

REINHOLZ: If induction is in early phase, then the symmetrical form is
more frequently occurred, more than in a later stage of development.<p>

LANGRIDGE: Are these tricotyledonous plants only deviating in the
cotyledons?<p>

REINHOLZ: No, these plants also form more leaves until flower
formation. Their symmetry seems to be threefold throughout. Sometimes
we can even see three carpels, and the fruit is tripartite.<p>

BROWN: I have found a similar tricotyledonous mutant like your
"trifolia" type, which has three axes for leaves as you described it.
It segregated in the second generation derived from plants subjected
to gamma-irradiation from 6 prior to meiosis.<p>

REDEI: Do you know from other examples in higher plants, how this
tricotyledonous stage is inherited? Can it maintain with 100%
expression?<p>

REINHOLZ: No, STRAUB (1948) summarizes that in all cases known up to
now the expression is always lower than 100%.<p>

KRANZ: I have some similar experience in Antirrhinum. I had a
viridis-mutant from the collection of MELCHERS, and in this material
three of 400 plants showed this characteristic.<p>

REINHOLZ: Yes, these low percentages are quite frequent.<p>

REDEI: Did you find monocotyledonous plants?<p>

REINHOLZ: There are also monocotyledonous, but they die very early.
The distribution is such, that the tricotyledonous are the most
frequent ones. But there are also forms with 4, 5, 6, and more
cotyledons.<p>

REDEI: Is this aberration due to differentiation of cotyledons or
rather just splitting of existing "Anlagen", or initials of
cotyledons?  And in the case of single, two would be fused?<p>

REINHOLZ:. We have tried to solve this problem. Therefore the study of
dependence on developmental stages, in which the embryo is irradiated,
was done. I was not surprised to find that in the stages shortly after
fertilization seeds were especially sensitive for inducing of these
aberrations. At the stage of 1, 2, or 4 cells embryo, however, to
treat this point by microtechnique is not so easy, as it is not
possible to make directed cuttings from Arabidopsis fruits, especially
in the young stages. We tried therefore to pick up the young ovules
singly and to direct them, when embedding them with the aid of
micromanipulator.<p>

MULLER: We have also irradiated various stages of embryogenesis.
Concerning the induction of embryonic malformations the results were
essentially the same as in the experiments of Dr.  REINHOLZ. But we
scored the frequency of recessive lethal mutations, too, and found
that the mutuation frequency steadily decreases with the progressive
embryogenesis.<p>

ROBBELEN: I wish to comment on the splitting on the initial meristem.
I had a recessive mutant, which I called "shizocotyledon".  It made
apparently in the latest stages of embryo development such cotyledon
fissions, which produced multicotyledonous seedlings. You could see a
brownish margin in the fission area. Homozygous mutant seedlings
originating from seeds of heterozygous plants 10 days after
germination showed a phenotype like Figure 3 a (in comparison to
control left) and were able to develop a normal shaped, though smaller
and yellow "hearted" rosette after 6 weeks (Figure 3 b; control
right). The same genotypes but from seeds of homozygous mutant plants
were sublethal, however, after the same 6 weeks (Figure 3 c) they were
hardly alive and never gave any seed. This difference similarly
indicates that a critical phase of action of this gene is during
embryo development.<p>
