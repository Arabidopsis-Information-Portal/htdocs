<h2>Effect of helminthosporol and helminthosporic acid on seed germination and senescence of leaf discs of Arabidopsis thaliana, En-2</h2><p>

Recently, helminthosporol (H-ol) and helminthosporic acid (H-acid)
have been shown to act very much like gibberellin (GA) in several
plant systems (HASHIMOTO et al., 1967; HASHIMOTO and TAMURA, 1967a).
These substances have also been claimed to be active in inducing
germination of light sensitive seeds of tobacco in total darkness
(HASHIMOTO and TAMURA, 1967b).  In Arabidopsis gibberellic acid is
well known for its promoting effect on the germination of seeds kept
in darkness (KRIBBEN, 1957; REINHOLZ, 1967).<p>

Recently, we observed that gibberellin can also effectively retard the
senescence of excised leaf discs of Arabidopsis (SANKHLA and SANKHLA,
1968).  It seemed, therefore, of interest to evaluate the comparative
efficiency of GA, H-ol and H-acid in the process of seed germination
and senescence of leaf discs of Arabidopsis.<p>

Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana, En-2 (obtained through the kindness of
Dr. KRANZ of this institute), and the mature leaves (33 days old)
obtained from the plants grown in the green-house served as the
experimental material.  In the table 'percentage senescence' was
calculated on the basis of percentage of chlorophyll degradation
during the experimental poriod in comparison to the control.<p>

Results relating to the effect of H-ol, H-acid and GA in the darkness
at 25*degrees*C have been repesented in the table.  It is clear that
while GA significantly increased the dark germination, both H-ol and
H-acid remained completely ineffective in this respect.  However, in
their effect on leaf senescence both H-ol as well as H-acid did
indicate some positive response, but the effect was clear only
initially and at lower concentrations. Further, this effect varied
from strain to strain and often differences in response were noticed
when leaves of different ages were used for experimentation.  In
contrast, gibberellin always gave constant and reproducible results
(SANKHLA and SANKHLA, 1968).  Thus it would appear that both H-ol and
H-acid probably have a restricted activity in comparison to GA, and in
Arabidopsis these compounds do not appreciably indicate
gibberellin-like properties.<p>
