<h2>Promotion of Arabidopsis seed germination by blue, red and far-red light</h2><p>

	The stimulation of germination in the dark by a short irradiation with red light (R) and the reversion of this effect by postirradiation with far-red (FR) has been described by SHROPSHIRE et al.  (1961) in Arabidopsis thaliana, race Estland.  Generally, the reaction of our race ST 56 of A. thaliana proved to be the same.  For our irradiation experiments dry seeds were soaked for 24 or 48 h on 0,75% Agar with Knop solution in the dark.  The following 15 min of red light irradiation successfully stimulated germination, while an addition of 15 min of far-red reverted this stimulation to the level of the dark control (Table 1).  During soaking as well as during germination in dark after the irradiation treatments a standard temperature of 25*degrees*C was used.  A detailed description of the light sources has been given elsewhere (VELEMINSKY and ROBBELEN, 1966).<p>

	Using the same cultivation techniques, the dark germination could also be promoted by blue and far-red light.  In these cases, however, several hours of irradiation were needed to reach the same percent of germination as after the action of 15 min of red light. Both, the blue and far-red effect were dependent on the duration of irradiation as it is typical for the so called High Energy Reaction (HER) (see Table 2).<p>

	This HER effect was intensified by a following 15 min of red light irradiation, regardless whether it was applied immediately or after a 24 h dark period (D).  It could be reverted by a 15 min of far-red, but only to the level of germination induced by the HER.  Just so a short time irradiation with far-red, given after the HER stimulation + a 24 h dark-period, did not influence markedly the degree of the HER-induced germination (Table 3).<p>

	The HER stimulation of germination was very slight, if any, when the agar for germination was prepared without Knop-solution (Table 4).  Moreover, the stimulation after 15 min of red light was slighter, when the seeds were pre-irradiated with far-red for 27 h, than after the same time of dark soaking.  On the contrary, such a drastic effect of the Knop-solution was not observed after a similar irradiation of lettuce seeds (cultivar "Maikonig").<p>
