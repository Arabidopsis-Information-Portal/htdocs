Postdoctoral Positions Available
Two postdoctoral positions are available immediately in the laboratory of
Prof. Gary Stacey at the University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA. The
first position relates to our continuing studies of the systems biology of
the soybean root hair cell (see Trends in Plant Science 15:641). The second
position relates to our studies on the role of chitin as an elicitor of
plant disease resistance (see Plant Cell 20:471). The laboratory is highly
productive and the successful candidate will be joining excellent teams
working on these projects. The successful candidates should have excellent
training in genetics, molecular biology and/or biochemistry with clear
evidence of past research productivity. With regard to the chitin project,
applicants should demonstrate a strong background in plant pathology or
related area. Further information about the laboratory can be obtained at
http://www.staceylab.missouri.edu/.

Candidates should submit a cover letter indicating their interest in one of
the two positions and detailing experience and past research success.
Include a copy of your curriculum vitae and submit three references letters
