ABSTRACT<p>

Whereas the insecticide propoxur and nitrite are non-mutagenic,
nitrosated propoxur exhibited a high mutagenicity in Arabidopsis
thaliana.<p>

INTRODUCTION<p>

It has been demonstrated that several nitrogen-containing pesticides,
drugs, food-additives etc. afford mutagenic and carcinogenic N-nitroso
compounds by interaction with nitrite (Preussmann and Eisenbrand,
1984). The formation of these N-nitroso compounds in our environment
represents thus a serious risk to the human, animal and plant
population.<p>

Several esters of N-methylcarbamic acid are widely used in agriculture
as pesticides. At acid pH, and in the presence of nitrite,
N-nitrosoderivates of N-methylcarbamate insecticides are readily
formed which mostly exhibit a stong mutagenic activity (Woo, 1983).<p>

Propoxur 2-(1-methylethoxy) phenylmethylcarbamate is extensively used
for flies, mosquitoes, aphids, bugs and other insect pest control.
Although propoxur is non-mutagenic, its nitrosated derivative is
highly mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium (Seiler, 1977) and induces
DNA damage in human skin fibroblasts (Blevins et al., 1977).<p>

We report on the formation of nitrosated propoxur and its mutagenicity
in Arabidopsis thaliana. The mutagenic effects of the nitrosation
mixture of nitrite and N-methylurea (MU), resulting in the formation
of highly mutagenic N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU), are presented for
comparison.<p>

METHODS AND MATERIAL<p>

Propoxur (PPX) was a commercial product (Unden; Bayer AG) containing
20% of 2-(1-methylethoxy) phenylcarbamate. N-methylurea was purchased
from Sigma (St. Louis, Mo. USA).<p>

The nitrosation mixture consisted of PPX or MU and NaCO 2, dissolved
in 0.2 M citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 3.0). The incubation proceeded
at 37*degrees*C for 3 hours. The formation of nitrosated propoxur
(NO-PPX) and MNU was determined by the methods of Forist (1964) and
Preussmann and Schaper-Druckrey (1972) with the help of the Griess
colour reagent and spectrophotometric measurements (Beckman DB
spectrophotometer, 550 nm absorbance).<p>

For mutation studies, seeds of A. thaliana strain Dijon were used. For
each treatment about 1000 seeds were treated with the mutagenic or
control solution. After the mutagenic treatments for 3 hours at
25*degrees*C, the seeds were rinsed for 30 min in tap water and sown
onto soil in a greenhouse. The methods developed by Muller (1963),
1964) were used to estimate the frequency of embryonic and chlorophyll
mutations, and for calculating the degree of sterility. Three siliquae
per plant, from each of 60 plants, were scored in each treatment and
control group.<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

Incubation of 0.25% PPX with 10 to 80 mM NaNO 2 resulted in the
formation of NO-PPX, as demonstrated by spectrophotometric
measurements. The yield of the formed NO-PPX depended on the
concentration of nitrite in the nitrosation mixture (Table 1).<p>

The increase of the mutagenic activity of the nitrosation mixture PPX
+ NaNO 2 was similarly dependent on the concentration of nitrite,
e.g., application of 0.25% + 80 mM NaNO 2 induced 72.2% mutations
compared to 29.4% when only 10 mM nitrite was presented in the
nitrosation mixture. As PPX and NaNO 2 are non-mutagenic in A.
thaliana, the mutagenicity of the nitrosation mixture PPX + NaNO 2 has
to be ascribed to the formation of NO-PPX.<p>

Table 1: The mutagenicity of nitrosated propoxur (NO-PPX) and
N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU), formed in vitro in the nitrosation
mixtures of propoxur (PPX) and NaNO 2, and N-methylurea (MU) + NaNO 2.<p>

Treatment conditions: nitrosation mixtures incubated at pH 3.0 for 3
hours and 37*degrees*C and then applied for 3 hours at 25*degrees*C to
seeds of A. thaliana.<p>

The data on the formation of MNU in the nitrosation mixture MU + NaNO
2 are presented in Table 1. The yield of formed MNU after a 3 hour
incubation of 2 mM MU + 2 MmM NaNO 2 equaled 54% of the theoretically
possible amount (2 mM MNU = 100%); in the case of the incubation
mixture of 1 mM MUY + 1 mM Na NO 2 the yield was 36% (1 mM MNU =
100%).<p>

The experiments reported provide a model system for studying the
formation and mutagenic activity of various N-nitroso compounds which
may be formed in our environment (including the human stomach) by
nitrosation of various agricultural chemicals.<p>
