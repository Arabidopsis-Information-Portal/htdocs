In the presence of the environmental mutagens antimutagenesis is one
of the actual problems for the development of theoretical and
practical strategies of gene pool protection. The use of Arabidopsis
in antimutgenetic investigations is limited and only a level
characteristic of radiation-induced mutation, modified by enotannin
was obtained (Alekperov et al., 1983). The ability to modify mutations
induced by other factors and its quantitive estimation still remain to
be determined. Therefore the modification ability of mutations induced
by environmental mutagens which are the real pool mutants at some
industrial enterprises has been studied.<p>

NaF was used at concentrations of 10 mkg/ml. The seeds were tested
during 18 hours with mutagen and then rinsed with tap water (1 hour).
They were subsequently sown in tubes with agarized mineral medium, to
which enotannin (1x 10 3 mkg/ml) was added, and germinated at
24*degrees*C under continuous illumination. Muller's embryo test was
applied to analyze chorophyll mutations in unripe siliquae (Muller,
1961). Index of Arabidopsis seeds survival was analyzed to estimate
NaF general toxicity in special experiments. The seeds were exposed to
preparation and the process modified by enotannin.<p>

The results are given in the table below.<p>

Table 1: Effect of enotannin on mutability induced by NaF.<p>

As shown in the table NaF sufficiently suppresses the plant survival
whereas the addition of enotannin into the medium decreases the NaF
substance toxicity to some extent. Enotannin also decreases the
induced level of mutability since the frequency is more than 2 times
lower. Thus the general protective action of enotannin and its
possible application of Arabidopsis as a test for antimutagenetic
investigations proceed.<p>
