ABSTRACT<p>

In this study, binding of auxin to crude membrane extacts from wild
type and aux-1 seedlings was compared using a modified method of the
centrifugation assay of BATT et al. (1976) in which reversible binding
of the ligand is estimated by measuring the displacement of bound
labeled NAA in equilibrium with a saturating concentration of the
unlabeled substance.<p>

INTRODUCTION<p>

Previous communications have described mutants of Arabidopsis which
are resistant to the inhibitory effects of auxins on root growth
(Maher and Martindale, 1980; Mirza and Maher, 1987; Estelle and
Somrville, 1987). These alterations in sensitivity to auxins could be
the result of a number of cellular changes, such as increased content
of endogenous auxin, increased abilitiy to metabolise the auxin to an
inactive form or enhanced ability to transport auxin from a site of
sensitivity but it has been shown that in the mutants aux-1
(Martindale, 1982) ands Axr-1 (Estelle and Somrville, 1987) the
resistance does not simply reflect decreased uptake of exogenous auxin
from the culture media. A striking pleiotropic effect of the aux-1
mutation and mutations in pea (Eason et al., 1987), barley (Tagliani
et al., 1986) and tomato (Kelly and Bradford, 1986) is abolition of
the gravitropic response and this strongly suggests that the effect of
these mutations is mediated by a change in a receptor for auxin which
participates in the control of gravitropism. Auxin receptors have been
extensively studied in maize and other species (reviewed by Venis,
1985 and 1987) and the existance in Arabidopsis of a receptor
analogous to that of maize has been suggested by studies in which a
cDNA probe for the maize receptor hybridised to a fragment from a
restiction digest of wild type Arabidopsis DNA (M.A. Venis, personal
communication).<p>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<p>

Arabidopsis thaliana Landsberg erecta seeds were sterilized in a 70:30
v/v mixture of 20 volumes hydrogen peroxide and ethanol for 10
minutes, washed with distilled water on Buchner filtration apparatus
and transferred to 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 ml of a
simple mineral nutrient medium. The culture vessels were given two
days in darkness at 4*degrees*C then placed in a continuous
illumination for 24 hours of culture on a rotating surface (98 rpm) in
a reduced light intensity (10 microM quanta mE-2sE-2). These three
days old seedlings were used immediately or were frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at -70*degrees*C for future use.<p>

Certain aspects of the culture conditions were varied to test their
effect on aluxin binding activity. On one occasion the seedlings were
cultured in darkness after the initial 24 hour period of illumination
and in one experiment 100 nM NAA was included in the culture medium
since incubation in auxin has been shown to induce auxin binding
activity in other tissues (Trewavas, 1980; Bhattachariyya and Biswas,
1982). Specificity of NAA binding was investigated by using the simple
aromatic acid, benzoic acid (BA) as the displacing ligand instead of
NAA.<p>

Batches of between three and eight grammes of whole seedlings were
homogenised with a mortar and pestle in grinding buffer (0.25 M
sucrose, 50 mM Tris, 1 mM Na 2 EDTA, 0.1 mM MgCl2, pH 8.0) and a small
amount of washed sand using approximately 1.5 ml of buffer per gramme
fresh weight of plant tissue. The homogenate was squeezed through
cotton gauze and reground in the same volume of fresh buffer. The
combined filtrates were centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 minutes and the
supernatant was recentrifuged at 39000 ge for 30 minutes (Sorvall
RC30B centrifuge, SS34 rotor). The pelleted membranes were resuspended
with a teflon-glass homogeniser in wash buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM
trisodium citrate, 0.5 mM MgCl2, pH 6.0) and this suspension was
centrifuged for a further 30 minutes at 39000 g. The washed membranes
were resuspended in binding buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM trisodium
citrate, 5 mM MgSO4, pH 5.5) Tritiated naphthylphthalamic acid (NAA,
30 ci pr mM) was added from a stock solution in ethanol giving a final
concentration of approximately 2 nM. Five minutes were allowed for
binding of the label after which the membrane suspension was divided
into two equal sized aliquots. Unlabelled NAA was added to one half to
a final concentration of approxiamtely 100 micro M (treatment A)) and
an appropriate amount of ethanol was added to the other half
(treatment B). Triplicate or quadruplicate 1 ml samples were taken
from each treatment, added to small centrifuge tubes (Sorvall,
cellulose acetate buryrate) and centrifuged at 39000 g for 30 minutes.
The membrane pellets were allowed to drain onto paper towels, rinsed
with distilled water and the activity in each was estimated by liquid
scintillation counting. Reversible binding is represented by counts
per minute for treatment B (cpmB) minus counts per minute for
treatment A (cpmA). All manipulations ere carried out on ice or at
4*degrees*C in a cold room. To test the specificity of binding, in one
experiment, after addition of the tritiated NAA, the membrane fraction
was divided into three aliquots: a control, one with 10 micro m NAA as
the displacing ligand and a third with 100 micro m BA.<p>

RESULTS<p>

A series of 7 experiments was carried out, 6 of these on wild type
tissue and 1 on aux-1. The results are summarized in Table 1.<p>

Table 1: Reversible binding of H 3-NAA to membrane extacts of wild
type Arabidopsis and the mutant aux-1.<p>

One feature of all of these results is clear: in each case cpmA was
less than cpmB indicating that there was displacement of some of the
bound label in each case. In frozen seedlings cultured under standard
conditions the total bound radioactivity ranged from 860 cpm gE-1 to
1504 cpm gE-1 with reversible proportions of between 4.0% and 12.8%.
Fresh seedlings grown under the same conditions yielded total cpm gE-1
of between 1550 and 1153 with reversible proportions of between 6.1%
and 9.6% respectively. These results appear to show that total binding
was reduced without affecting the reversible proportion, but a direct
comparison of fresh and frozen material in the same experiment (4)
showed this not to be the case as the total cpm was greater for the
frozen material. Freezing of the tissue before the binding assay did
not, therefore, abolish auxin binding and if there was any effect of
freezing on the size of the reversible proportion then it was within
the errors of the system and not detectable. Culture of the seedlings
in a medium containing NAA appeared to have no effect on binding with
a reversible proportion of 9.3%. Growth in the dark, however, gave the
highest total binding of 1905 cpm, perhaps, due to a greater
proliferation of membranes in the etiolated plants, but the reversible
percentage of 6.1 was neither remarkably high nor low. On the one
occasion that aux-1 was tested the total bound label was lower than
any of the wild type values at 611 cpm but the reversible proportion
of 8.9% falls within the range of the wild type results.<p>

When the specificity of the binding for auxins was checked using BA as
the displacing ligand it was found that the reversible proportions of
bound NAA were nearly equal when either NAA or BA was used (Table 2)
indicating that the affinity of the sites responsible for the binding
have an affinity for BA almost as great as that for NAA.<p>

extracts with a saturating concentration of benzoic acid.<p>

It is also clear that the reversible proportions of binding were far
in excess of those found in any previous experiment, the result for
NAA was the lowest value recorded at 521 cpm and it appears that the
reversible binding was increased in this experiment at the expense of
nonspecific binding, even though no differences in the methods were
introduced.<p>

DISCUSSION<p>

If binding of a plant growth regulator is to be considered as a
receptor phenomenon it must satisfy stringent requirements (Venis,
1987) including reversibility, high affinity, specificity for the
ligand and it must be of finite capacity. This study addressed the
reversibility and specificity of binding of auxin to membrane extracts
of Arabidopsis seedlings.<p>

In all experiments a small proportion of the binding was found to be
reversed by high concentrations of NAA. If cpmB were to exceed cpmA
only by chance then the probability of this occuring on 8 successive
occasions would be one chance in 516 so it can be stated with
reasonable certainty that the reversible binding that was observed is
significant. The nonreversible fraction of the binding probably
represents absorption of the lipophilic NAA molecules into membrances
of their uptake into sealed vesicles. In both of these cases this type
of binding is nonspecific and NAA bound in this way will not
equilibrate with the ligand in free solution. Culture of the seedlings
in an auxin containing medium had no obvious effect on auxi binding so
it is unlikely that the binding in this tissue is due to a receptor
that is regulated by its own ligand as has been suggested for other
tissues where such a phenomenon was observed. Displacement of bound
label was shown to be almost as great with benzoic acid as with NAA
indicating that the specificity of binding is low. Although high
specificity of binding is broadly accepted as one of the criteria for
a receptor, it is yet to be established whether BA lacks significant
auxin like activity in this system and relatively low specificity for
aucin analogues has been shown for Site 1 binding in maize coleoptile
membranes characterised by BATT et al. (1986). Binding of NAA similar
to that in the wild type was also found in the mutant aux-1 indicating
that auxin resistance in this genotype is not due to a large
alteration in reversible auxin binding as a proportion of the total,
but the mutation could cause changes in receptor charactristics which
would not be evident in this type of test.<p>

These results demonstrate the existence of reversible binding of low
specificity of NAA to membranes of Arabidopsis seedlings but whether
this is due to binding by a physiologicaly significant receptor is not
yet clear. Preliminary attempts to assess the kinetics of the binding
and to obtain an estimate of the dissociation constant of binding (Kd)
have indicated that it is low, in the order of 10-100 microM but there
is variability in the results and the experimental system requires
some refinement. The principal problems are the high level of
nonspecific binding which tends to obscure small but potentially
important differences in specific binding and the difficulty of
obtaining sufficient quantities of one type of tissue. However, it is
likely that specific binding will be increased with appropriate
development of the methods, and aseptic culture of roots offers a
possible solution to problem of tissue specificity.<p>
