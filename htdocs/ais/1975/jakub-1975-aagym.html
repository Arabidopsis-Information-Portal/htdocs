It is known that chlorophyll mutants are very good for the research in
questions concerning genetical control of the photosynthetic process
(VOSKRESENSKAYA et al., 1968; JAKUBOVA, 1972a).  The task we had in
mind was to study photochemical activity of the photosynthetic
apparatus in monohybrid foliage chlorophyll mutant 58/15 (viridis),
induced by 1% ethylemethansulfonate. The chlorophyll content in mutant
58/15 is twofold less than in the initial form (JAKUBOVA et al.,
1972b).<p>

The following parameters have been considered: delayed light emission,
absorbance changes in the 520 nm area and photoinduced changes of
absorption in the 554 nm area in intact leaves; the detailed
characteristic of these parameters is given in the publications of
STRELER (1951) and RUBIN (1973).<p>

Figure A: Induced curvex of delayed light emission<p>

Figure B: Absorbance changes in the 520 nm area<p>

Figure C: Photoinduced changes of absorption of cytochrome in the 554
nm area.<p>

As figure 1A shows, A. thaliana leaves have a normal induction curve
showing the presence of two components of delayed light emission. The
induction curve of 58/15 is characterized by the reduced delayed light
emission as compared with the control.<p>

These data answer well the present ideas on the realationship of the
delayed light emission intensity with the chlorophyll content and the
differentiation of the photosynthetic apparatus.  Mutant 58/15 does
not manifest the violation but the slowdown in the process of
transport of electrones and the membranes' energy supply as compared
to the initial form, which is indicated by the course of the induction
curves of the delayed light emission.<p>

The data of figure 1 B prove that the kinetic of the absorbance
changes in the 520 nm area of the normal type and of the mutant of A.
thaliana is one-phase as opposed to the leaves of peas, tobacco and
cotton that show two-phase curves. When excited by the light signal
the amplitudes in the initial form are higher than in the mutant.
These data also indicate the lower energy supply of the membranes in
connection with the transport of the electrones in 58/15.<p>

The results of the photoinduced changes of cytochrome absorption in
the 554 nm area prove the absence of the effect in 58/15 (fig.1C).
These data suggest that the membranes' energy reduction in connection
with the transport of the electrones is associated with the absence of
the indicated effect in the mutant.<p>
