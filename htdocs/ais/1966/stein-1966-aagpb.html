	Fixation of Arabidopsis buds for meiosis can be made in the usual 6 : 3 : 2 (methanol, chloroform, propionic acid) with the addition of 1% "Tween 20".  This eliminates the need of evacuation. Good meiotic metaphase preparations have been obtained in this manner, but earlier meiotic stages are difficult to stain.<p>
