A postdoctoral position is available in the laboratory of Dr. Hongchang Cui 
in the Department of Biological Science at the Florida State University to 
study the genetic and epigenetic basis of cell fate specification, sugar 
signaling and root development, using the Arabidopsis root as a model 
system. The successful candidate is expected to learn/use various methods 
from molecular genetics to genomics and proteomics, and novel technologies 
for the isolation of individual cell types (including but not limited to the 
Fluorescence-Assisted-Cell-Sorting method). Highly motivated candidates with 
a PhD in Molecular Biology and/or Biochemistry are encouraged to apply. 
Previous experience with epigenetic research, developmental and stress 
biology is a plus. Application is open until the position is filled. 

For further information, please contact Dr. Cui and see 
http://www.bio.fsu.edu/faculty-cui.php. 

To apply, please send C.V. and a brief statement of research experience and 
interests as well as contact information of two referees to Dr. Hongchang 
Cui (hcui@bio.fsu.edu).
