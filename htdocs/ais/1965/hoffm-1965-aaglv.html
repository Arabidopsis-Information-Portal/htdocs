Vol 01S: <h2>Chlorophyll Formation and Photosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) HEYNH.</h2><p>

P. HOFFMANN<p>

The short living crucifer Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) HEYNH. is not only
a very suitable object for genetic experiments. but it may also be
successfully used for physiological investigations, because it is
possible to study certain processes at different stages of ontogenesis
under controlled conditions.<p>

In connection with our problems concerning the productivity of
photosynthesis in relation to chlorophyll content and other factors in
the plastids, we report on preliminary results with Arabidopsis
thaliana. Simultaneously they show the photosynthetic behaviour of
this plant during its vegetation period.<p>

Post-dormant seeds of the Arabidopsis race En-1 were sown on soil,
pricked out after 10 days, and cultivated under continuous
illumination (300 ftc.) in room temperature. The determination of gas
exchange and chlorophyll content was carried out with whole plants
without roots acording to the methods described in principle in an
earlier publication (HOFFMANN, 1962). In order to get a possibility of
comparing the results of different series, the plants were analysed at
acharcteristic stages of development: after having developed about
eight leaves as rosette (I) and after beginning to shoot (II). (The
chlorophyll synthesis in relation to formation of plastid structure in
the younger stages of Arabidopsis plants was extensively studied by
ROBBELEN, 1957). For the third stage those plants were chosen that
showed the first flowers (III). Further determinations were made when
the husks were appearing (IV) and when they were beginning to ripen
(V). At last plants were analysed that had ripe husks and
preponderantly dead branches. The number of rosette leaves remained
nearly constant (8-9) in stages I-III, it declined in the following
stages until all rosette leaves were dead in stage VI. The vegetation
period from sowing to fading varied under our cultivation conditions
between 60 and 70 days. The plants achieved a length of more than 25
cm and had the highest fresh and dry weight per plant in stage V.
Their water content was 90% in rosette stage and declined afterwards,
corresponding with FRANK's results (1954).<p>

The results of the analysis of total chlorophyll content and gas
exchange are shown in Table 1. On the basis of fresh weight
chlorophyll content declines from stages I to III. In stage IV the
plants develop by-buds ("Bereicherungstriebe", BARTHELMESS, 1965) with
new stem leaves thus leading to a rise of pigment content with
following slope. The relation of chlorophyll a/b varies between 3,29
(stage I) to 2,00 (stage VI). Similar results have been published by
HIRONO (1964). Brutto- photosynthesis measured as Co2-fixation in
light plus dark respiration shows an appropriate course while
respiration declined continuously from stage I to stage VI.  The well
known climacteric rise (HOFFMANN, 1962) is not clear in this case,
because whole plants were used. In the older stages, the plants had
relatively young leaves besides old tissues thus covering the normal
trend for a single organ. (The portion of single organs--leaves,
stems, husks--to the whole metabolism is to be determined in further
studies.)  It is impossible to conclude from parallelism between the
values of chlorophyll content and the intensity of photosynthesis that
both factors depend directly on each other as recently postulated by
SESTAK (1964). Usually chlorophyll is in excess in normal green leaves
(HOFFMANN, 1962, 1963). There is no direct dependence of the C02-
assimilation on pigment content as is to be shown when the results are
related to the single plant: pigment content increases more than
brutto- photosynthesis but falls slower.  Therefore we assume that
other factors limit the photosynthetic intensity. In this connection
changes of the strength of banding between the chlorophyll and
liproproteid complex on the age of leaves and the development stage of
the plan (VITKORSKAYA and BARANOV, 1963) as well as a decrease of the
activity of enzymes of the Calvin-cycle with increasing age (SMILLIE,
1962) are to be discussed.<p>

In further investigations we determined the content of the plastid
quinones, plastoquinone and vitamin K, which play an important part in
the light reactions of photosynthesis (EGGER, 1965). According to our
preliminary results these compounds are also in excess in the
chloroplasts. But it would be very interesting to find mutants
possessing none or only some of these quinones; an intense study of
these forms would bring about a better knowledge of the photosynthetic
electron transport system.<p>

Further studies have been prepared to investigate the importance of
other plastid compounds and structural factors for the physiology of
photosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana.<p>
