Excellence in Plant Molecular Biology/Biotechnology
Graduate Fellowship Program at OSU

The Plant Molecular Biology/Biotechnology (PMBB) Program at The Ohio State 
University is being dramatically expanded as a Targeted Investment for Excellence 
initiative by Ohio State. PMBB is an interdisciplinary group that includes faculty 
members from the Colleges of Biological Sciences and Food, Agriculture and 
Environmental Sciences. PMBB research programs conduct molecular studies on the 
cutting edge of plant science, including plant development, plant signaling, plant 
metabolic engineering, photosynthesis biochemistry, and plant-pathogen interactions. 
PMBB invites outstanding students seeking to earn a Ph.D. in plant science from any 
of the participating graduate programs at OSU to apply for the newly established 
Excellence in Plant Molecular Biology/Biotechnology Graduate Fellowships. The 
fellowships provide up to 4 years of support, including stipend ($25K/year), full 
benefits, tuition and fee waivers, and travel opportunities. Application instructions 
and detailed information, including a directory of PMBB faculty and participating 
graduate programs, is available at: http://www.ag.ohio-state.edu/~pmbb/
