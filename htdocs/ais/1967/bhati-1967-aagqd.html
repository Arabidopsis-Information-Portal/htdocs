<h2>Dimethyl sulfoxide as a carrier for chemical mutagens</h2><p>

	Some preliminary observations on the effect of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) alone and some other chemical mutagens dissolved in DMSO were reported earlier (BHATIA and SMITH, 1966).  The object was to investigate the feasibility of using DMSO as a carrier for chemical mutagens to utilize the rapid absorption and transport of DMSO and substances dissolved in it through biological membranes.  This report includes some additional data on the use of DMSO for this purpose.<p>

	Use of 30% DMSO reported earlier was later found to increase lethality of treated seedlings, therefore, for further work only 5% DMSO was used.  Two kinds of mutagens were tried, the widely effective and potent EMS and the thymidine analogues IUdR, BUdR, and FUdR in aqueous and 5% DMSO solutions, either singly or in combination.  The thymidine analogues IUdR and UdR though reported to increase the frequency of lethals and laggards in the M2 generation (BROWN, BHATIA, and SMITH, 1965), have not yet been demonstrated to induce distinct chlorophyll or morphological mutants in Arabidopsis or in other higher plants.<p>

	Eleven-day-old seedlings, raised aseptically on mineral agar were treated with aqueous or 5% DMSO solutions of the mutagen by placing a drop at the growing point with a micro-syringe.  At this age, the early flower buds are at premeiotic stages. Details of the given treatments are listed in Tables 1 and 2.  Each M2 population was the selfed progeny of a single M1 plant and was raised in a separate petridish. he frequency of albina mutants was used as a measure of the mutagenic effect of each treatment. hese mutants, unlike other chlorophyll mutants, can be recognized with certainty in the seedling stage of the M2 generation.  Pooled results of three independent experiments with E and two with base analogues are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<p>

	The results indicate that 5% DMSO alone is not mutagenic in Arabidopsis but enhances the effect of EMS, approximately two-fold. This most likely is due to an increased and more rapid uptake of the mutagen. With the thymidine analogue treatments, no albina type of mutants were observed in the M2.  Two chlorina mutants occurred in one family and another M2 family had a seedling with a mutated sector.  However, these mutational events seem to be of spontaneous origin and quite unrelated to the treatments given. These results seem to confirm that treatment of flower buds at premeiotic stages with the thymidine analogues IUdR and BUdR do not yield any chlorophyll mutants.<p>
