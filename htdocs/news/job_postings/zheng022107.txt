Graduate student positions

Positions are available for graduate students who are interested in plant
cell and developmental biology.  We are a research group focusing on the
molecular regulation and subcellular organization of intracellular membrane
trafficking in the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana.   Membrane
trafficking - beyond its role in the delivery of proteins, lipids and
polysaccharides to proper cellular destination, - is central to many aspects
of plant developmental processes and cellular adaptation to environmental
stresses.  We are to use reverse genetics to exploit the regulatory role of
small Rab-A and Rab-E GTPases and forward genetics to identify novel genes
that are involved in plant-specific membrane trafficking, cell
morphogenesis, and stress adaptation.  The genetic approaches will be
combined with molecular biology and fluorescent protein-based in vivo
imaging.

Candidates should apply for admission to the department of Biology, Mcgill
University. (see http://biology.mcgill.ca/grad/gradstudies.html). For more
