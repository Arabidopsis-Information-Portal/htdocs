A postdoctoral researcher position is available immediately to study 
the regulatory mechanism of pathogen-induced small RNAs in plant 
immunity. Endogenous small RNAs have emerged as important players in 
gene expression reprogramming during disease responses. The candidate 
will establish and conduct the genetic screening to identify new 
components in this pathway in Arabidopsis. The candidate will be also 
involved in identification and functional characterization of the 
pathogen-induced small RNAs. Applicants should have a Ph.D. degree 
and a strong background in genetics, molecular biology and 
biochemistry. Experience in Arabidopsis genetic screening is highly 
desirable.  We are part of the Center for Plant Cell Biology 
(CEPCEB), Institute for Integrative Genome Biology that equipped with 
state of art genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics facilities.
