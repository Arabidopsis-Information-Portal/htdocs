	A lack of seed dormancy of some chlorophyll mutants has been reported by several authors (WALLACE and HABERMANN, 1958).  This phenomenon is generally explained by the absence of carotenoids.<p>

	In our experiments a similar mutant, albina-50 (according to the numeration of our laboratory), was observed.  The seeds of this mutant gained from heterozygous plants germinated immediately after the harvest, whereas the normal seeds from the same plants germinated only after a certain dormancy period.<p>

	The dormancy period of normal seeds and also the germinability of albina mutants was influenced by the storage conditions.<p>

	Seeds from heterozygous plants were stored in desiccators with saturated solutions of Ca(NO3) 2 x 4 H2O (relative humidity at 20*degrees*C + 55.9%) resp. with P205 (relative humidity at 20*degrees*C = 5%) under the temperature of 5 and 24*degrees*C resp.  After various times of storage, seeds were sown on Petri-dishes with wet blotter paper and after 8 days the germination was scored.  (Germination conditions:  20 to 25*degrees*C, 12 hrs light, 7,000 lux.)<p>

	In conditions of storage, inducing according to ROBBELEN and KERSTEIN (1965) a short dormancy period of normal seeds, the albina seeds lost their germinability approximately after two months.  Conditions of storage prolonging the dormancy period prolonged also the germinability of albina mutants.  The germination of both albina mutants seeds and of the normal seeds was inhibited by coumarin and thiouracil, the action of the latter could be, however, reverted by uracil (VELEMINSKY, 1967).  The seeds of albina mutants are able to germinate in dark, but normal seeds cannot. This character is influenced by the storage conditions in the same way as germination by light.<p>

	It seems that the loss of germinability is irreversible, as a cold treatment (50*degrees*C, in dark; Van der VEEN, 1965) which stimulated the germination of the normal seeds did not have an effect on albina seeds.<p>

	Chromatographically and under a UV-lamp no chlorophylls and carotenoids could be found in the cotyledons of albina 50.  We observed a similar lack of dormancy in the case of another albina mutant, but this did not germinate in the dark.<p>

	It is not clear, however, whether there is a causal relation between the absence of carotenoids and a lack of dormancy, since we also found an albina mutant without carotenoids and chlorophylls with the same dormancy period as the normal seeds.<p>
