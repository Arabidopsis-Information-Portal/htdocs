A three-year postdoctoral position is open at the John Innes Centre,
Norwich, UK.
 
The candidate will work on a collaborative project between the Sablowski and
Ostergaard labs, aiming to understand how changes in gene regulation account
for differences in fruit development between Arabidopsis and Brassica and to
use this knowledge to control pod shattering in Brassica.
 
The candidate will have a PhD in molecular biology, genetics or related
subject. Experience in plant development and/or bioinformatics are
desirable. The candidate must be able to develop and optimise advanced
protocols in molecular biology (e.g. in vivo footprinting, chromatin
immunoprecipitation) and will be expected to perform non-trivial sequence
analysis (e.g. phylogenetic footprinting). Creativity and intellectual
independence are essential, and proven ability to write scientific papers is
desirable. The candidate must be available to travel to international
meetings and for short visits to collaborating labs abroad.
