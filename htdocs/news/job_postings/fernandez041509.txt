Postdoctoral Research Position 
University of Wisconsin-Madison 
 
A full time Research Associate position is available immediately in the laboratory of Donna 
Fernandez, Department of Botany, to investigate genetic and physical interactions between 
MADS-domain transcription factors involved in the control of flowering time.   We are using 
genetic and molecular approaches to define the regulatory roles of AGL15 and AGL18 (Plant J. 
50: 1007-1019, 2007) in relation to the roles of other MADS-domain floral repressors. 
 
The successful candidate will become a member of the vibrant plant research community in 
Madison. The initial appointment will be for one year, with a possibility of extension by one or 
more years. 
 
A Ph.D. degree in molecular biology, genetics, or a related field is required.  Previous experience 
with plants is desirable.  Candidates must have excellent communication skills. Interested 
applicants should send a CV, list of publications, brief summary of previous research experience, 
and contact information for three references by e-mail to dfernand@wisc.edu.
