A postdoctoral position is available to study interactions between
Arabidopsis and Myzus persicae (green peach aphid) in Georg s lab
at the Boyce Thompson Institute. The focus of this research is the
functional analysis of aphid saliva, with particular emphasis placed on
identifying salivary effectors that either facilitate insect feeding or
elicit plant defense responses. Other research will include analysis of
mutants and natural variation in Arabidopsis aphid resistance. Development
of additional areas of interest within the scope of the project is
encouraged. The position will be filled as early as January, 2010, and
funding is available for two years. Candidates with backgrounds in
molecular biology, insect behavior assays, or small molecule analysis are
particularly encouraged to apply. The Boyce Thompson Institute is a
private not for profit research organization located on the campus of
Cornell University in the scenic Finger Lakes region of upstate New York.
