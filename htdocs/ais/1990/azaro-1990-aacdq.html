Estimation of microgametophyte response in vitro is of great use for
testing and selection of plants on the basis of salt stress tolerance
(SACHER et al., 1983).  It might also be possible to select resistant
pollen grains in vitro and after it to transfer germinated grains on
the style of mother plant for artificial pollination. The
possibilities of such an approach are experimentally shown for a
number of plants (MULCAHY, 1985; VASIL, 1987). Arabidopsis is a very
favourable object for studies of the type due to its short vegetation
and high seed production. In studies reported the artificial nutrient
solution was developed for germination of A.  thaliana pollen, and the
effect of NaCl introduction on pollen tube growth was investigated for
different races.<p>

For this work 10 races of A. thaliana, listed in Table 1 were used.
Plants were grown in climatic chamber on soil culture under constant
environmental conditions: 24-25*degrees*C, 6-8 klux illumination.
Pollen was germinated on nutrient media developed by us. Analytical
grade reagents were used. Glass-distilled water was obtained from the
DPE 4 "Simax" apparatus. In 100 ml of water 7.81mg CaCl 2, 12.72mg
MgSO4, 47.77mg Ca(NO3)2 x 4H 2O, 5.83mg K 2HPO4 x 3H 2O and 17.8mg K
2SO4 were dissolved. After this pH was adjusted by 0.1 N KOH to 7.42.
After it 50mg H 3BO3, 25g sucrose and 3g agar were added to the
solution. The mixture was heated to boiling point with stirring, up to
the moment of complete agar dissolution. Up to 0.3 or 0.5% of NaCl was
added if needed in the basic media obtained.<p>

A drop of this medium was applied on the slide fixed in inclined
position, and pollen was applied on the thin layered agar. Slides were
placed pollen side down on the glass rods in a petri dish with a piece
of moist filter paper to maintain high humidity. Dishes were incubated
in the thermostat with temperature of 24-25*degrees*C for 10-12h. The
pollen grains were considered as germinated if pollen tube length was
more than one grain diameter.<p>

Significant differences were established between 10 races of A.
thaliana and their pollen germination in vitro both on basic and
NaCl-supplemented solutions.  The data are cited in Table 1.<p>

NaCl added; 3 - 0.5% of NaCl added.<p>

*All deviations from control values (basic solution) for the same race
are significant at p<0.01 level.<p>

Pollen of Columbia and Condara race was most salt resistant. The most
susceptible were pollen samples of Dijon and Landsberg-erecta races.
On 0.5% NaCl they had 2.3% and 3.5% germination, respectively. There
were differences also in pollen tube growth between races studied on
basic and NaCl-containing solution (Figure 1). On the basic solution
these differences were not very significant, with the possible
exception of Landsberg-erecta race, and pollen tube length approached
in all cases 30 pollen grain diameters. But on NaCl-medium these
differences were quite significant. On the solution with 0.3% NaCl the
succession on the basis of pollen tube length was Condara >
Khodga-Obi-Garm = Columbia = Peterhof 8 > Landsberg-erecta = Limburg =
Estland > Rubegnoye > Dijon > Blanes. On the 0.5% NaCl media the
succession was: Condara > Columbia > Estland = Limburg > Rubegnoye >
Peterhof 8 > Blanes = Khodga-Obi-Garm > Landsberg-erecta = Dijon. On
the last medium the reduction of pollen tube length was very strong,
and its average value did not exceed two grain diameters.<p>

The results presented demonstrate the existence of hidden polymorphism
in Arabidopsis microgametophyte resistance to NaCl action. Genetic
nature of this polymorphism and its connection with sporophyte
tolerance in Arabidopsis are still not clear. But a significant range
of this difference permits to hope that the selection of
NaCl-resistant A. thaliana microgametophytes will be possible and
helpful for artificial induction of sporophyte polymorphism in salt
resistance.<p>
