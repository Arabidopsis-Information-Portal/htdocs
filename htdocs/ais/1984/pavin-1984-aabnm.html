INTRODUCTION<p>

Arabidopsis thaliana crown galls readily differentiate plants (Aerts
et al., 1979) and most of the regenerated plants show opine
synthesizing activities (Ondej et al., 1984). Nopaline synthase
activity was found also in the R 1 and R 2 generation of the offspring
of regenerants (Pavingerova et al., 1984). Here we give our up to date
results with hairy root tumors incited by Agrobacterium rhizogenes and
Agrobacterium tumefaciens with Ri instead of Ti plasmids.<p>

MATERIAL AND METHODS<p>

Several A. rhizogenes strains were used: strains 8196, TR7, and TR101
belong to the mannopine type; strain 15834 belongs to the agropine
type. While mannopine strains induce tumors synthesizing mannopine as
the only opine, agropine strains induce tumors which synthesize both
mannopine and agropine as mannopine is the precursor of agropine
(Petit et al., 1983). Two strains containing Ri plasmids in A
tumefaciens without Ti plasmid were also used. One of them, which we
called 10 is A tumefaciens C58C1 (pRiA4 a,b,c), i.e., with three Ri
plasmids and the other, called 24 is A. tumefaciens C58C1 (pRiA4 b),
i.e., with the virulence Ri plasmid only. Both induce hairy root
tumors synthesizing mannopine and agropine. A. rhizogenes strains were
obtained by courtesy of Dr. J.A. Lippincott, Department of Biol. Sci.,
Northwestern University, Evanston, ILL., USA and A. tumefaciens
strains with Ri plasmids were obtained by courtesy of Dr. A. Petit.

RESULTS<p>

Tumors were induced in the in vitro cultivated A. thaliana plants race
Dijon as described by Aerts et al. (1979) and Ondrej et al. (1984).
Hairy root tumors appeared within two weeks. They grew at first as
undifferentiated tissues and in next two weeks they were surrounded by
roots. After detachment from the plants, hairy root tumors were put on
PG 0 medium (Negrutiu et al., 1975) containing carbenicilin (500 micro
g/ml) and vancomycin (500 micro g/ml) for the elimination of
Agrobacterium. In a considerable proportion of tumors, plants or
teratomas differentiated. Teratomas were gradually converted to plants
in next three subcultivations each lasting four weeks. Both
undifferentiated tumors and differentiated roots ceased their growth
gradually.<p>

The ability of hairy root tumors induced by different Agrobacterium
strains to differentiate teratomas and plants differed. Generally,
agropine strains induced hairy root tumors with higher proliferation
and shoot differentiation capacity than mannopine strains. The
contrary is true in Petunia (Ondrej, upubl.). Tumors induced by A.
rhizogenes 15834 showed highest regeneration capacity, followed by
tumors induced by strains 24 and 10. Better development of the root
system and disturbances in tropisms (Figure 1) were the prominent
morphological changes observed in the regenerate plants. Most plants
showed mannopine and agropine synthesizing activity (Table 1).
Regenerated plants showed normal fertility. The R 1 plants in the
offspring of regenerants did not show more any tropism disturbances
but part of them still showed opine synthesis (Table 1).<p>

Figure 1: Modifications of the growth of plant regenerated from hairy
root tumor incited by A. rhizogenes 15834. Unproportional development
of strong root system is evident. Most of the roots, which are thicker
than in untransformed plants, grow on the surface of the medium and
upwards. One of the shoots grows downwards into the agar layer.<p>

SUMMARY<p>

These results show unequivocally the transmission of opine synthesis
as tumor marker through meiosis to the seed progeny of Arabidopsis
thaliana hairy root tumor regenerants. More detailed analysis of the
inheritance of opine synthesizing activities in the progenies of
individual regenerants is in progress.<p>
