	In earlier communications (CETL, DOBROVOLNA, and EFFMERTOVA, 1965; CETL, 1965) it has been shown that there exists a relation between the geographical-climatic conditions of localities and the developmental character of populations growing in West Moravia:  the "winter annual" populations seem to be bound to the more warm and dry lowland, the "summer annual" populations to the more cold and wet highland, while the "mixed" ones occupy intermediate positions.<p>

	In experiments carried out in conditions inducing a rapid flowering in the summer annual types and inhibiting it in the winter annual ones (unvernalized post-dormancy seeds grown on soil at 25+/3*degrees*C under continuous illumination with 1250 lux, duration of the experiment 42 days), it was possible to distinguish between the two main developmental types.  The percentage of the generative plants was chosen as a measure for the developmental properties of a population. With the aid of this characteristic, the correlations were estimated between it and the geographical-climatic conditions expressed by (1) the height above sea level, and (2) the average temperature (macroclimatic data for 1901-56 read from SYROVY, 1958).<p>

	Significant positive correlation coefficients were found for the height above sea level and the percentage of generative plants (r=0.6197, P<0.0001 in the 64 populations collected in 1963/64, and r = 0.4710, P = 0.0001 in the 45 populations collected in 1965).  For the average yearly temperature and the percentage of generative plants, the correlation coefficients were significant and negative (4= -0.3996, P<0.01, and r = -0.3068, P<0.05, respectively). Thus the more elevated the geographical position and the lower the average yearly temperature, the more a population consists of generative (=summer annual) plants, and vice versa.<p>

	Interesting results were also obtained when the correlations were estimated between the monthly average temperatures and the percentage of generative plants (Figure 1).  In both of the series, the maximum values were found for September (P<0.0001).  A second meximum could be shown in February-March (P<0.0001, and P<0.01, respectively).  On the other hand, for the winter months (December, January) the correlation coefficients were low and mostly unsignificant.  For the spring and summer months (April to August) the values of correlation coefficients were near to those for the yearly average.  This means that the autumnal and also early spring temperatures appear to be mainly responsible for the above indicated relation.<p>

	These results seem to be in agreement with the hypothesis (CETL, 1965) that the lack of summer annual types in the lowland can be connected with the danger of their premature passing into the generative state and of a subsequent loss of the wintering ability, and that the temperature conditions of the autumnal period appear to be decisive.  In other words, at least in the territory studied, there seems to exist an effective selection pressure against the summer annual types in the lowland localities where the autumnal temperatures are relatively high.  A similar explanation may be valid also for the early spring period.<p>
