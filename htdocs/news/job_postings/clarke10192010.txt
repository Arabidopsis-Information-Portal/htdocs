Post-doctoral position in light and hormone signaling

A post-doctoral position is immediately available at the Gregor Mendel Institute of Molecular Plant 
Biology (GMI), in Vienna, in the group of Dr Claudia Jonak (http://www.gmi.oeaw.ac.at/cjonak.htm). 
Our group is interested in the molecular mechanisms of how plants react and adapt to environmental 
changes. We seek to better understand the interface between signal transduction and the coordinated 
response of cellular metabolism and gene expression. 

Candidates require a strong background in light and/or hormone signaling and proven experience in 
genetics, molecular biology, and/or biochemistry. He/she will analyze the function of a novel light- 
and brassinosteroid-regulated protein kinase in Arabidopsis.

The GMI is a newly established basic plant research institute of the Austrian Academy of Sciences 
located at the Vienna Biocenter Campus. The GMI provides a stimulating, international, English-
speaking environment and supports research by state-of-the-art services, including excellent plant 
growth facilities.

If you are interested in the position, please forward your application including your CV, a brief 
description of your research experience and interests, a letter of motivation and contact information 
for 2-3 senior scientist referees by e-mail to claudia.jonak@gmi.oeaw.ac.at.
