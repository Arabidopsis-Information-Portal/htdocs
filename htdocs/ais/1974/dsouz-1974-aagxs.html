As described elsewhere in this issue, we have devised a screening
procedure to detect apparent invertase-less mutants of Arabidopsis.
In order to confirm the lack of hydrolytic activity in the isolated
seedlings and to attempt to distinguish heterozygotes within
individual M2 families, we have also developed an in vivo technique
for assaying invertase activity. The results we report here are of an
experiment to determine the time course of the assay and the
reproducibility of the technique.<p>

Wild type seeds of race Est were germinated aseptically on 0.75% agar
containing 0.1% KNO3 at an angle of 60*degrees*, 10.000 lux,
25*degrees*C. 5 day old seedlings were measured and incubated under
sterile conditions in 1 ml 2% sucrose (Aristar) for varying priods of
time at 25*degrees*C.  Controls included seedlings incubated in water
only and substrate incubated without seedlings. At the end of each
incubation period the reducing sugar content of the bathing solution
was determined by the method of NELSON (1944).<p>

Figure 1 shows the time courses obtained for single and double
seedling incubations.  Each point is the mean of 5 replicates. The
results were subjected to orthogonal polynomial analysis which showed
a highlysignificant linear function in both cases (P.001) and
negligible cubic and quadratic functions.  Lines of best fit were
obtained by regression analysis, the regression coefficient for the
single seedling incubations being 5.48 (S.E. = 0.419, t = 13.1***
d.f.=23) and 12.06 (S.E. = 0.683, t = 17.6***, d.f. = 23) for the
double seedling incubation.<p>

This technique therefore presents a reliable and convenient way of
determining the level of invertase in individual seedlings and it
should be possible to identify heterozygotes if they have lowered
levels of the enzyme. After completion of the assay seedlings may be
transplanted aseptically to agar containing mineral salts and
appropriate carbohydrate. Such seedlings have been successfully grown
to maturity on 2% sucrose or glucose.<p>
