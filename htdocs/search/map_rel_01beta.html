June 14, 2001<BR>
</CENTER>

	  <p>We are pleased to announce an update to TAIR's
comprehensive <a href="/servlets/mapper/">Map Viewer</a>. It allows you to search, browse, and align the map elements and maps available from TAIR's database. Each map element
is hyperlinked to a detail page from our database. A detailed Help
document on what is available and how to navigate this tool is
available: <a href="/mapViewer/help/tairmaps.htm">TAIR Map Viewer
Help</a> </p>

	 
	             <p><b>Major Enhancements</b> : 
              <ul>
		<li>Clicking on genes will display gene detail page from the database.<img alt="[NEW]" src="/images/new.gif" border=0>
                <li>Displays hits on multiple chromosomes from text searching.

		<li>Searches through aliases.
                <li>Coding regions from TIGR/MIPS annotation are displayed on the AGI maps at zoom level 200x and higher.
	        <li>Wild card searching is implemented and will highlight all entities found. (e.g. *SNP*, AG?, ve*)
                <li>Show/hide function is implemented to display three rows of entities or all entities.
		<li>Tick marks to show entities that are hidden.
		<li>Genetic maps are zoomable to 80x.   
              </ul>
              
              <p><b>Bug Fixes</b> : 
              <ul>
                <li>All clones and probes on physical maps are shown.
	        <li>Entities on the south ends of the chromosomes are shown.
		    
              </ul>
              <p><b>Known Bugs</b> :
              <ul>
		<li>Some probes on Physical maps are not currently hyperlinked to the database.
                <li>A few of the coding regions are not shown on the AGI map, due to discrepancy in the name of the clones or lack of annotation data from TIGR.
		    
	      </ul>
              <p><b>Coming Soon</b> :
              <ul>
		 <li>Show/Hide function according to data types for each entity.   
                <li>Reference Sequence Map zoomable down to nucleotide level and displaying sequence annotations including gene features and polymorphisms.
		 <li>Additional entities such as insertion sites and transcripts will be displayed.
		<li>Experimentally verified gene structures will be color-coded.  
                <li>Different marker types will be color-coded.
		    
              </ul>

	       <p>Please note that this is a second version and we are working 
                on improving functionalities for our next version. Please let 
                us know if you find any glitches in the interface, suggestions 
                for improvement, and/or any errors in the data. You can contact 
                us at: <a href="mailto:curator@arabidopsis.org">curator@arabidopsis.org</a>.
