INTRODUCTION<p>

It was suggested (Cetl, 1978) that there are no conclusive data on the
origin of the species Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. Sometimes, the
centre is located in western Europe (Redei, 1975). Numerous species of
the genus Arabidopsis are distributed in the mountain regions of
Central Asia, especially in high mountains of Tadjikistan (Yunusov,
Kasyanemko and Jsmanov, 1969), and this fact may lead to the idea that
the putative centre of variability and of the origin of the whole
genus may be located there (Kranz, 1978), even if the Vavilovian
concepts of the centres of diversity and of the centres of origin
should be not confused (Zohary, 1970).<p>

The genetic system controlling flowering time was extensively used in
studying genetic variability of natural populations of A. thaliana
from Moravia and their genetic structure (Cetl, 1976). This system is
responsible for the distribution of A. thaliana genotypes not only
within particular geographical-climatic gradients (Cetl, 1978), but
even over large territories (Ratcliffe, 1965). Thus it appeared
intresting to look for the flowering time in the seed material of A.
thaliana brought by Ing. Vladimir Cizek, Forestry Faculty,
Agricultural University, Brno, from his Tadjikistan botanical
expedition in 1977, and to compare it with the materials from Moravia.<p>

Long ago, the transplant experiments under uniform growing conditions
were successful in solving various problems of variation and evolution
of higher plants (Hiesey, Clausen and Keck, 1942; Stebbins, 1957), and
this experimental pattern was used also in the present study. In
connection with this attempt, a prospect of further comparative
experiments of this kind on a larger material basis was imagined for
the next future.<p>

MATERIAL AND METHODS<p>

The seeds were collected at maturity in Chodja-Obi-Garm (Hissar
Mountain Ridge in West Pamir Alai) in the locality occupied by the
population Chodschi-1 (cf. Usmanov et al., 1978) on June 10, 1977. A
sample of about 50 seeds was harvested separately from each of 50
plants taken randomly. Thus in the first generation, G1, 50
independent lines were available orgiginating from the seeds of
individual plants collected at Chodja. Each of these lines consisted
of about 11 plants, on an average. Owing to to a low number of plants
in some lines, only 42 lines could be evaluated in the G1 generation.
Seeds were harvested of all G1 plants separately. In the next
generation, G2, the progenies of G1 lines nos. 6, 23 and 42,
consisting of 10 sublines each with about 9 plants averagely, were
studied for the present.<p>

All experiments were carried out under usual experimental conditions
(temperature 25+/-3*degrees*C, continuous illumination 1250 lux with
incandescent bulbs for 42 days, cf. Cetl, 1976) so that a direct
comparison with the Moravian material was possible. The G2 progenies
of G1 lines nos. 6, 23 and 42 were grown simultaneously under
continuous illumination and under the day length shortened to 12
hours. In the latter case survival of plants was very limited; six
sublines gave no plants, so that only 24 sublines could be evaluated
with about 4 plants each, on an average.<p>

The following characteristics of flowering time were determined: (1)
the proportion of generative plants during 28 and 42 days after
emergence, g 28 and g 42 (percent), and (2) the mean number of days to
the appearance of the flower primordia in the generative plant
fraction, x (days). In the latter charactristic, intraclass
correlation coefficients, W, and regression coefficients of progenies
on parents, b, were used in estimating the heritability. Comparing the
G2 results obtained under continuous illumination and under short day
it was possible to express, by means of the x 12/x 24 ratio, the
degree of the long day photoperiodic requirement.<p>

The material structure of this experiment was somewhat different from
that used in our experiments with Moravian population samples where a
mixed random sample of seeds from minimum 25 plants was always used
without studying lines from seeds of individual plants collected in a
locality. In the present experiment, this structure enabled us to do
comparisons on the basis of unweighted means of line means and of the
pooled data in G1. Similarly in G2, the results are given as line
means pooled over sublines and as pooled data.<p>

RESULTS<p>

No substantial differences were found between unweighted means of line
means and pooled data in the &#199;hodja-Obi-Garm population for the
proportion of generative plants during 28 and 42 days after emergence
and for the mean number of days to the appearance of flower primordia
in the gnerative plant fraction. Compared with the materials from
Moravia all charactristics showed that the Chodja population was
clearly later in flowering having a lower g 28 proportion (by 11
percent), a higher g 42 proportion (by 20 percent) and a higher mean
number of days to the appearance of flower primordia ( by 11 days).
The proportion of plants which did not appear flower primordia before
42 days, however, was only about 13 percent in the Chodja population
while in the Moravian populations 31 percent (Table 1).<p>

Table 1: Proportion of generative plants during 28 and 42 days after
emergence (g 29 and g 42, percent) and the mean number of days to the
appearance of flower primordia in the generative plant fraction (x,
days) in G1 lines of the Chodja-Obi-Garm population compared with the
same characteristics obtained in 258 population samples from
Moravia/M...unweighted means of line or population means, P...(pooled
data)<p>

Computing the intraclass correlation coefficient in G1, W+/- s.e. =
.3843 +/- .0454 was found in the Chodja population while among those
Moravian population samples whose intraclass correlation coefficients
were yet measured, the W's fluctuated between .16 and .69. Thus the
obtained figure lying within the limits of the Moravian materials but
not reaching their maximum range testified for a rather low
heritability.<p>

The lines nos. 6, 23 and 42 consisting of 10 sublines each could not
fully represent the whole material in the G2 generation as it is
shown, for instance, by lower x values in the lines nos. 6 and 42,
significantly deviating from the G1 population mean (Table 2).<p>

appearance of flower primordia in the generative plant fraction (x,
days) in the G2 lines nos. 6, 23 and 42 of the Chodja-Obi-Garm
population.<p>

The G2 estimates of coefficients of heritability by means of
intraclass correlation coefficients, W, and regression coefficients of
progenies on parents, b, were surprisingly low and, in the majority of
cases, they did not differ from zero (Table 3).<p>

The x 12/x 24 ratio expressing the degree of the long day
photoperiodic requirement was similar in the three lines fluctuating
in relatively narrow range (Table 4). Comparing the obtained x 12/x 24
values with our former scanty data these values seem to be
intermediate, on the whole.<p>

DISCUSSION<p>

In spite of the fact that the extent of the presented material was
rather small (only one population sample with a sufficient number of G
1 plants but with a limited number of lines, sublines and plants in
the G 2 generation), some interesting conclusions can be suggested
following from the comparison of the flowering time in the materials
from Tadjikistan and Moravia.<p>

The Chodja population appears to be of more late flowering than the
overall average of all Moravian population samples studied up to this
day. It was already shown that the Chodja population has a lower
proportion of plants appearing flower primordia during 28 days after
emergence and a higher proportion of plants appearing flower primordia
during 42 days after emergence. The rest, i.e. plants remaining
vegetative at the end of a 42 day experiment and thus very late in
flowering is, however, less numerous but this circumstance can be
ascribed to the fact that we have to do with only population. In fact,
literally none of the 258 population samples from Moravia showed the
specific "rhythm" of appearing flower primordia in the Chodja
population as may be illustrated as follows (cf. Cetl, 1978):<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol16/vol16-pg61-fig1.gif">Click here for figure</a><p>

The higher mean number of days to the appearance of flower primordia
compared with the Moravian mean testifies for the same fact.<p>

It is known that our exprimental conditions (high temperature,
continuous illumination) allow to manifest the differences in the
vernalization requirement of genotypes constituting populations (Cetl,
1976); further, in our experimental examinations only genotypes
appearing flower primordia 28 days after emergence and later possess a
sufficient vernalization requirement that they are able to winter
successfuly under the environmental conditions of the Moravial
lowlands (Cetl, 1978). Usmanov et al. (1978, p. 116) observed 10 to 15
percent of summer annual plants in the Chosschi-1 population. It
follows from a direct calculation that the limit separating
nonwintering summer annuals from winter annuals which are able to
winter under the environamntal conditions of the Chodchi-1 population
lies at the 23rd day after emergence of our experimental examinations.
It means that in the Chodschi-1 locality genotypes are able to winter
which are 5 days earlier compared with the Moravian lowland
localities, provided that the differences between summer annuals and
winter annuals are connected with nonwintering and wintering,
respectively. Thus the prospect of comparative experiments mentioned
above seem to contribute, under certain presuppositions, to a more
exact classification not only of populations but also of their
localities.<p>

Less explicit conclusions follow from the attempts to estimate the
coefficients of heritability of flowering time. In each case, however,
the W value obtained in G1 suggests that the proportion of additive
genetic variation in the Chodja population is not so high as in those
Moravian populations whose heritabiity estimates fluctuate between .5
and .7 but clearly higher than in the group of Moravian mountain
populations with zero heritability (Cetl, 1976).<p>

Still lower figures obtained in G 2 may be connected with the low
number of lines, sublines and plants studied. In general, there exist
some suggestions that the relatively low estimates of heritability in
the Chodja population bear upon the presence of nonadditive genes for
flowering, probably with dominance and, especially, as shown by some
G2 sublines, also with epistasis.<p>

Finally, the results obtained studying the same G 2 sublines
simultaneously under continuous illumination and short days suggest
that the Chodja population has in no case an extreme requirement for
long days. Cetl and Kucera (1966) showed that the x 12/x 24 ratio
fluctuated between 2 (low long day requirement) and 4 (high long day
requirement) in a small series of populations and lines. The figures
about 3 or somewhat lower show that the Chodja population is
intermediate in this respect.<p>

It is to remind that the high long day requirement is proper to
"alternatives", i.e., genotypes which are able to winter successfully
under autumnal germination or sowing but flower also under spring
germination or sowing. Thus the "alternatives" are different for both
summer annuals and winter annuals. Cetl (1966) suggested that many
"alternative" type might be a primary one. From this point of view we
can say that the Chodja population with its only intermediate long-day
requirement cannot be classified with true "alternatives", at least
with no extreme "alternatives", and that its successful wintering is
connected rather with a high vernalization requirement as it is
manifested by its late flowering under high temperature and continuous
illumination.<p>

These considerations suggest that valuable information may be obtained
by adding experimental variants with a shortened photoperiod and
possibly also with vernalization. All these means may be useful in the
comparative study of the genetic systems controlling flowering time
with the aim to recognize the relations between populations and their
localities over shorter and longer distances.<p>

SUMMARY<p>

Compared with the Moravian materials the Chodja-Obi-Garm population is
rather late flowering, has a lower proportion of flowering genes with
additive effects and its long day requirement is not too high.<p>

Some consequences are given which may lead to a further development of
the comparative study of genetic systems controlling flowering time.<p>
