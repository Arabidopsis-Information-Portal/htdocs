Research Associate (Postdoc in Plant Biology)

A BBSRC-funded postdoctoral position is available immediately for a 
strongly motivated individual to study mechanisms of chloroplast protein 
transport in the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. Novel nuclear mutations 
that affect the efficiency of chloroplast protein import were identified in 
earlier work, using a forward-genetic screen for extragenic suppressors of 
the well-characterized chloroplast protein import mutation, tic40. More 
recently, the SUPPRESSOR OF TIC40 (STIC) genes were identified by map-based 
cloning. This project aims to characterise the functions of the STIC 
proteins in detail, and to elucidate how they influence import efficiency. 
Applicants should have a Ph.D. and a strong background in a relevant 
discipline. Experience of molecular cell biology research will be 
essential, and experience of research on Arabidopsis and/or organelle 
biology will be highly desirable. 

Informal enquiries are welcome and should be made to Professor Paul Jarvis 
on rpj3@le.ac.uk or +44-116-223-1296. Information on the laboratory where 
the project will take place is available online:
