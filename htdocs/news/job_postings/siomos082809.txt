A PhD student position on environmentally triggered signalling 
events in Arabidopsis thaliana is available in the lab of Claudia Jonak 
(http://www.gmi.oeaw.ac.at/cjonak.htm). Research in our group focuses on the 
mechanisms of how plants react and possibly adapt to adverse growth 
conditions.
 
The successful candidate should be highly motivated and have a solid 
background in biochemistry and/or molecular biology. He/She will investigate the 
fundamental role of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)-directed signal 
transduction for adaptation to environmental stress. We offer cutting-edge 
technical equipment, service facilities and an international, intellectually 
stimulating environment at the Gregor Mendel Institute of Molecular Plant 
Biology (GMI) inVienna/Austria (www.gmi.oeaw.ac.at).
 
For more information, please contact Claudia Jonak (see below). To apply, 
please send a letter of motivation, a curriculum vitae including a brief description 
of your research experience and interests, and contact information 
to:  claudia.jonak@gmi.oeaw.ac.at
