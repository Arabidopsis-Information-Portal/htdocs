Techniques used in fungal genetics for the isolation of nutritional
mutants usually involve some procedure aimed at enrichment of the
required mutants in the sample to be screened.  One of these
procedures is the so called starvation method of McDONALD and
PONTECORVO (PONTECORVO et al. 1953) which takes advantage of the
phenomenon that double mutants with two nutritional deficiencies
sometimes survive longer on mimimal medium than the single mutants
involved.<p>

We used an analogous method in our search for mutants of Arabidopsis,
blocked in some step of the nitrate metabolism.<p>

After mutagenic treatment of seed of a non-leaky thiamine requiring
line, M1 plants are grown on a medium supplied with thiamine.  M2
families are grown under continuous illumination at 28*degrees*C in
petridishes on perlite, without thiamine and with nitrate as the sole
nitrogen source. After about 2 weeks most plants have died because of
lack of thiamine. At this moment the substrate is supplemented with
both thiamine and an ammonium salt. After some more days all growing
plants are transplanted to soil and grown to maturity in a green
house.  M3 progenies are tested for growth on a nitrate medium.<p>

In an experiment started with about 700 M1 plants and testing about
100 progenies of "rescued" M2 plants, we found 7 mutants that grow
much worse on a nitrate medium than on ammonium nitrate. Since we are
especially intrested in the isolation of mutants blocked in the
nitrate reduction, and since all 7 mutants do exhibit normal enzyme
activities, the mutants have not yet been studied further.<p>

This method can easily be adopted for the isolation of auxotrophic
mutants by proper supplementation acording to the requirement of the
mutants selected for.<p>
