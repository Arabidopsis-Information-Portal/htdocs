<h2>Seed aging causes mutant deficit</h2><p>

	With decreasing germination capacity old seeds from heterozygous Arabidopsis plants sometimes produce only a few or no recessive seedlings.  This was particularly true, when seedlings of our chlorophyll mutant stocks harvested as early as 1960 were sown on soil in October 22, 1965, in comparison to similar seed samples from 1962, 1964, and 1965. For example, the following mean germination percentages were gained from sowings of 3 x 100 seeds each after 10 days:<p>

	In this experiment the emergence of mutant seedlings was reduced already after one year of storage while the normal green seedlings still appeared with about 100%.  During all the years the seeds had been stored in a dry, cool cellar-room under conditions which kept the germinability rather well (cf. ROBBELEN and KERSTEIN, 1965).  Dr. VELEMINSKY from Prague told me that from segregating seeds after one year of storage in his laboratory in some cases no mutant plant could be received. Therefore, the above experiment was repeated with an equivalent sample of fresh, but fully after-ripened seeds stored for 104 and 175 days resp. in a desiccator over a concentrated KCl solution giving a rel. humidity of 86%:<p>

	The results demonstrate that the mutant deficit drastically increases under storage conditions which damage seed vitality.  The effect is different for the various mutants tested. The two albina types seem to be more sensitive than the more viable mutants, even though fresh seeds of L 31 heterozygotes usually show a significant surplus (against 25%) of mutant individuals. The finding may be of interest not only for the maintenance of seed stocks but also for mutation experiments.<p>
