The question of bacterial/plant interaction in the nitrogen-fixing
sybiosis between most legumes and specific rhizobial strains has
far-reaching agricultural and scientific implications. What are the
molecular signals exchanged between the plant host and the invading
bacterium? Why are other dicotyledonous species non-nodulators? What
stops these non-nodulators from forming nodules? What factors do the
bacteria require? Which of these are missing? What causes the apparent
host specificity of rhizobia? These are just a few of the questions
which need to be answered.<p>

Multiple genetic approaches using rhizobial and plant (white clover)
genetic systems are presently pursued (Gresshoff et al., 1977;
Skotnicki and Rolfe, 1978; Gresshoff and Rolfe, 1978). One of the in
vitro approaches is to use plant cell cultures to provide the
chemical/physiological stimulus to induce active nitrogen fixation
(acetylene reduction) in free living rhizobia (other than the cowpea
strain 32H1 or its relatives). Such system has been reported for
soybean/R. japonicum (Bednarski and Reporter, 1978), who used a two
chamber apparatus to identify substances exchanged between plant and
bacterial cells, thereby establishing the nif phenotype.<p>

An extension to these physiological studies would be the testing of
non-legume cultures for their capability of nitrogenase 'switch-on' of
R. trifolii. Appropriate nutritional environments have to be worked
out for this to be possible. Thus, it may be possible that many
nonlegumes actually harbour symbiotic genes in a cryptic fashion.
Similarly, it may be possible to use interspecific hybrids between
legume (white clover) and non-legume (such as Arabidopsis) to study
the complementation and interaction of such genes. Such hybrids are
attainable by protoplast fusions using a variety of fusion inducing
agents, of which polyethylene glycol (PEG) is probably the most
widespread.<p>

The following report describes the isolation, fusion and culture of
heterokaryocytes formed from fusion of protoplasts from Arabidopsis
thaliana leaf and white clover suspension/callus tissue.<p>

Trifolium repens (white clover) variety New Zealand was used to
establish callus cultures on SBCM1 (Baldwin and Gresshoff, 1978).
Thereof derived suspension cultures were kept in SBSM5 (Gresshoff,
1978a,b). Protoplasts were isolated by 5 hr incubation in 2%
Cellulysin, 2% Onozuka R10 Cellulase and 1% Driselase in PDB
(Gresshoff, 1976).<p>

Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia wildtype) plants grown on hormone free
B5 medium were used as source material. Leaves of 14-day-old plantlets
were incubated whole for 3 hours in 2% Cellulysin and 1% Macerase in
PDB (at 0.7 M instead of 0.5 M), then stained through a 100 micro m
nylon sieve with a rubber policeman to produce single cells and
protoplasts and further incubated for 60 min. to complete
protoplasting. All incubations were at room temperature. Protoplasts
were purified by centrifugation onto a 3% sucrose cushion at 200 g for
10 min. Only intact viable protoplasts accumulated at the interphase.
These are easily extracted with a pasteur pipette. Protoplasts of both
plant species were combined at 1: ratio and washed together by several
successive centrifugations and resuspension in PDB (0.7 M).<p>

The final protoplast suspension was at 4x10 5 cells/ml, when
concentrated PEG 1540 (in stock solution) was added to a final
concentration of 35-40%. All fusions were done in conical glass
centrifuge tubes (at 22*degrees*C). After 20 min in PEG 1540, high
CA++/pH wash solution (see Fowke et al., 1978) was added at 1 min.
intervals to give slow dilution of PEG to 10% inside a further 30 min.
Fusion mix was then washed extensively and resuspended in culture
medium (PCM24, Gresshoff, 1978a,b). Great care was taken to allow
maximum survival of protoplasts.<p>

After 48 hours in drop-culture (50 micro l) at 27*degrees*C, dark,
interspecific hybrids recognized by the hybrid morophology, mainly in
regards to colour (chloroplast development) were visually identified
and isolated by micropipette into individual culture droplets free of
parental cell types.<p>

Cell wall regeneration (Calcoflour staining) occurred in most
heterokaryotes within 48-72 hours after fusion. Cell divisions were
observed after a 'dormant' lag, which in some cases was up to 3 weeks.
Figure 1 gives an illustration of the fusion process. The precise
interspecific hybrid status of the heterokaryocyte clones has not been
established, because of the cytological difficulties trying to resolve
clover (2n=4x=32) from Arabidopsis thaliana (2n=10) chromosomes (all
extremely small).<p>

The fact, however, that the fusates were cultured in isolated droplets
free of parental cell types supports the view that the resultant
clones either are direct hybrids or may have undergone chromosome
elimination with retention of the clover karyotype (compare to KAO,
1977).<p>

Further culture optimization, especially in the direction to favour
the growth of Arabidopsis, is hoped to produce somatic hybrids with
all Arabidopsis and only few clover chromosomes.<p>
