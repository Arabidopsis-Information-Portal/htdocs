Seeds of the race Dijon treated with EMS (10 mM, unbuffered, 24 hrs,
24*degrees*C) gave final germination and survival-to-flowering ratios
almost equal to the control.  Of 360 M1-plants, 128 were sterile (or
almost so), and 101 yielded easy-to-score cotyledon mutants.  The
seeds of the first 12 fruits on the main stem were sown per fruit on
agar, and topographies of the fruit positions were made from the dried
(!) plants.<p>

To calculate sector size, only plants were considered, of which at
least 10 fruits gave at least 12 seedlings each, thus avoiding non-
representation of sectors and statistical escape of mutants within
fruits.  From 25 such plants, the average mutant sector size was
calculated as 24,8% (it is probable that no neighbouring sectors with
identical mutant phenotype occurred in these 25 plants).  This figure
does, of course, not necessarily imply that the sporocyte tissue
derives from 4 meristematic cells present at the start of treatment.<p>

Mutant sectors like (33 : 1,32 : 7,25 : 5) were found, which indicates
chimerism of borderline fruits.<p>

The details are included in a preliminary report read in 1964 for the
Genetical Society of the Netherlands (to be published in "Genen en
Phaenan", 1965).  In the meantime MULLER (1964) has reported detailed
studies on MNU induced chimerism, and we completely agree with his
statement that often reduced fertility goes in sectors like mutant
segregation does.  Since sterility and mutant segregation seem to be
distributed more or less independently over sectors, it would perhaps
follow for mutation-breeding, that only fully fertile fruits (or
sectors or plants) may be harvested, and that the mutagen
concentration should not be so high as to make such fruits (etc.)
rare.  However, the first author continues to study reduced fertility,
as more critical data are needed to see in how far this probably
oversimplified picture holds.<p>
