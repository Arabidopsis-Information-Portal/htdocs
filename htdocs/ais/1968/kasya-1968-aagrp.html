Chlorophyll mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana are suitable material for
investigations on gene action.  In the present study the following
non-allelic recessive types were used: chlorina 80/2, dark green
203/13, light green 80/1, viridoalbina 40/3, green with yellow spots
801/6 (all of them induced by gama-irradiation, 10-80 kR, of seeds), the
mutants V 156, V 44, V 120 and V 24/3 (kindly supplied by Prof. G.
ROBBELEN, Gottingen), and the mutant gl1, (provided by Dr.  K.V.
KVITKO, Leningrad).<p>

These chlorophyll mutants were grown during the autumn and winter
season in a greenhouse with a light-period of 12-14 hrs and a
temperature of 18-25*degrees*C.  Leaves of rosettes before flowering
were used for analysis. The pigment concentrations were determined
after paper-chromatographic separation (SAPOSCHNIKOV, BRONSTEIN, and
KRASOVSKAYA, 1955).  The "potential intensity of photosynthesis" was
studied with [14]CO2 (ZALENSKY, SEMIHATOVA, and VOZNESENSKY, 1955).  This
parameter signifies the intensity of photosynthesis in the leaf, when
light CO2-concentration (1%), temperature and some other factors are
optimal.<p>

Table: Pigment concentration and potential intensity of photosynthesis
in chlorophyll mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) HEYNH.<p>

The table demonstrates the complex effect of mutant genes on the
photosynthetic apparatus.  In some chlorophyll mutants the
concentration of plastid pigments is decreased, in others it is
increased.  Simultaneously the morphology of the plastids is altered
(cf. KASYANENKO, 1967; KASYANENKO and TIMOFFEEFF-RESSOVSKY, 1967).  In
consequence of these differences in pigment concentration and plastid
morphology the photoabsorbing capacity of the leaves and thus their
photosynthetic activity is changed (cf. KASYANENKO and GILLER, 1967).<p>

Therefore the indices for the "potential photosynthesis" are different
in the mutants.  Just so the relative efficiency of the chlorophyll
unit, i.e., the assimilation number" is variable.  Many of the
chlorophyll mutants are characterized by a comparatively high
"assimilation number".  Only two mutants, darkgreen 203/13 and
viridoalbina 40/3, have a low "assimilation number".<p>
