INTRODUCTION<p>

Arabidopsis plant can form flower buds relatively easily in total
darkness (Redei, 1975; Goto, 1981). Present work was aimed at
establishing the culture conditions for flowering of Arabidopsis plant
in total darkness.<p>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<p>

The seeds of each genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.0.Heynh. were
sown on 0.8% agar including Nitsch's medium (2% sucrose, pH 5.5)
(Nitsch and Nitsch, 1967) after sterilization with filtrate of 5% high
test bleaching powder for 10 min. and washing two times with water.
After 24 h incubation in the dark the seeds were irradited with white
light (about 5000 lux) for 8 h, and then allowed to germinate in
darkness at 25*degrees*C for another 4 days (the seeds cannot
germinate in complete darkness). The seedlings grown to about one cm
high were transferred to liquid Nitsch's medium and incubated at
25*degrees*C for a desired period in darkness. (A): Ten seedlings were
planted in 20 ml medium in a 100 ml Erlenmeyer flask and shaken on a
gyratory shaker. (B): A seedling was planted in a test tube (18 x 18
mm) containing (1) 3 ml medium, (2) 5 ml medium + glass beads (5 mm in
diameter, about 40 grains) or (3) 5 ml medium + a filter paper wick
(about 40 grains) or (3) 5 ml medium + a filter paper wick (about 7 x
10 mm, both ends of the paper, which was folded in two, were submerged
into the medium). The seedling was kept on the central part of the
paper, which was above the medium.<p>

The planting procedues were carried out under dim green light. The
flower buds formed were observed with a stereoscopic microscope.<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

Table 1 shows the frequency of flowering plants and number of leaves
formed before flower bud formation under various culture conditions.
The flower bud formation occurred the quickest and uniformly in the
shaking culture. However, in this culture method it was relatively
difficult to ascertain whether the flower bud was formed or not
because of the developing young leaves covering the growing point. In
the test tube cultures the frequency of flowering varied with lines
regardless of the glass beads; line En2n formed flower buds easily but
line Estland not more than 50%. On the filter paper the plants hardly
grew except for roots and few plants formed flower buds. In order to
form the flower buds the plants should be submerged in the nutrient
medium until at least three leaves are developed and then the growing
point emerges from the medium or is aerated sufficiently.<p>

Figure 1: Frequency of flowering plants in various lines and mutant
strains grown under total darkness. A plant was allowed to grow in 3
ml liquid medium in a test tube at 25*degrees*C.<p>

Figure 1 shows the flowering of three lines and 16 mutant strains in
total darkness cultured in test tubes. Line En2n showed the highest
frequency, reaching 100% by 35 days after sowing. Strain Ng-5 did not
form flower buds during the incubation period, and besides, the plants
hardly expanded leaves except for cotyledons. Many other lines and
strains began to form flower buds on about 25th day and reached 50-60%
flowering on the 50th day.<p>

Figure 2: Effect of low temperature and short period of illumination
on the flower bud formation in line En2n. A plant was allowed to grow
in 5 ml liquid medium in a test tube with glass beads or paper wick
under total darkness or under a photoperiod of 8 h light - 16 h dark.
A arrow indicates the time of transference to 25*degrees*C from
7*degrees*C.<p>

Figure 2 shows the effect of low temperature and short period of
illumination on the flowering. Earlier, it has been reported that the
flower buds were initiated in the dark at low temperature or by
vernalization in Raphanus sativus (Tashima, 1953; Kimura, 1961) and
Pharbitis Nil (Takimoto, 1960). However, Arabidopsis plant in present
experiment could neither form flower buds nor develop leaves except
for cotyledons at 7*degrees*C. Transferring to 25*degrees*C from
7*degrees*C on the 33rd day did not hasten the flowering, namely the
appearance of the first flowering plant needed another 19 and 34 days
in the paper wick method and the glass beads method, respectively.
This result suggests that the vernalization has no effect on the
flowering of Arabidopsis plant in darkness. Under a short day
condition (9 h light - 16 h dark), the plants grown in the nutrient
medium did not form flower buds during the incubation period although
they developed several green leaves. Conversely, the plants grown on
the filter paper began to form flower buds on the 28th day and all of
the plants flowered on the 47th day.<p>

Table 2: Effect of elimination of each ingredient of Nitsch's medium
on the frequency (%) of flowering plants in line En2n and Estland. A
plant was allowed to grow in 3 ml liquid medium in a test tube under
total darkness at 25*degrees*C for 36 days.<p>

Next, the effect of each ingredient of Nitsch's medium was
investigated (Table 2). Low pH (4.0) lowered the frequency of
flowering plants. The lack of sugar and nitrogen component completely
inhibited flowering as well as leaf growth. The lack of Fe,
micronutrients, or vitamines greatly reduced flowering. The optimum
concentration of sugar (sucrose) on the flower bud formation was 1% in
line Estland and within the ranges of 1-3% in line En2n (Figure 3).<p>

medium in a test tube under total darkness at 25*degrees*C for 20

Figure 4: Effect of KNO 3 concentration on the flower bud formation in
line En2n. A plant was allowed to grow in 3 ml liquid medium
containing 1% sucrose in a test tube under total darkness at
25*degrees*C.<p>

Figure 4 shows the effect of potassium nitrate as nitrogen source.
&#199;alcium nitrate in Nitsch's medium was replaced by CaC1 2 (300
mg/l) and KNO 3. The frequency of the flowering plants increased from
500 mg/l of KNO 3 and its high frequency was kept up until 1500 mg/l.
High concentration of KNO 3 also made both the leaves and stems to
grow vigorously.<p>
