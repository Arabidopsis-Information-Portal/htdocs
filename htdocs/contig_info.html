<center> <b>THIS PAGE PROVIDES FURTHER DETAILS AND HELP ABOUT THE
FORMS YOU CAN USE TO PROVIDE PHYSICAL-MAP CONTIG, CLONE, AND PROBE
DETAILS TO TAIR.</b> </center>
<p>

A <b>shorter summary</b> of the forms and links to them, may be found on the
<a
href="/contig_intro.html">
Intro to Submitting Physical-Map Detail to TAIR</a> form.

<p> This "About" page is linked from the forms in appropriate
places. Once you've read the help you need, use the "Back" button of
your browser to return to the form on which you were working.

<p>

The <b>purpose</b> of the forms is to allow the submission to TAIR of
clone hybridization details from chromosome-walking and
physical-mapping experiments in Arabidopsis. These data will then be
made available to the community through the TAIR Web server. At the
moment, we are able to display such data as tiling paths using <a href="/search">  TAIR database</a>.

<p>

Please note, there is a separate form to use if you are providing <a
href="/BAC.html"> BAC
mapping-data</a>.

<p>

You will need a forms-capable browser, such as <a
href="http://home.netscape.com/comprod/mirror/index.html">Netscape</a>,
to complete these forms, which are all still under development. Please
e-mail us at <a
href="mailto:curator@arabidopsis.org">TAIR Curator</a>
with any suggestions you may have for improvements.

<center><a name="Webforms"><b>How do I enter data on Web forms?</b></a><p></center>

For those of you unfamiliar with filling-in Web forms, there are five
different ways in which data are entered. The first four rely on
using the mouse only, the fifth requires you to type:

<form>
<b>Radio buttons</b>: <INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="example" VALUE="ignore">Click me 
<INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="example" VALUE="ignore_aswell">Or me
<INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="example" VALUE="ignore_too" CHECKED>I've been clicked
<br>


 Simply click on the appropriate choice. Usually to select only one option out of two or more.<p>

<b>Checkboxes</b>: <INPUT TYPE="checkbox">Click me
<INPUT TYPE="checkbox">And me
<INPUT TYPE="checkbox" checked>I've been checked
<br>
Click on a box to check or uncheck it. Can be used to select more than one option.
<p>
<b>Buttons</b>: Press to make something happen

<img src="/images/button.gif" alt="[button]">
<br> 
 (such as reset the form or to send information to us). Buttons may look different on your machine.

<p>

<b>Select</b>: <SELECT NAME="select_test">
<OPTION SELECTED VALUE=""> Click and hold
<OPTION> Move mouse to pick
<OPTION> The option you want
<OPTION> And then release
</SELECT>
<br>
Click and hold the mouse over the box to select one of a list of pre-defined options.
<p>

<b>Text-input</b>. You just click in the box and then type into it 
<INPUT NAME="ignore" SIZE=15>
<br>
(sometimes the boxes are much bigger.)

</form>

<hr>

<center><a name="Whichforms"><b>Which Web forms do I need to complete?</b></a><p></center>

In order to supply physical-map contig information to TAIR, you first
fill in <b>either</b> a <a
href="/contig_simplemap.html">
Submit Simple Contig Map Details Form</a> <b>or</b> a <a
href="/contig_complexmap.html">
Submit Complex Contig Map Details Form</a>.

<p>

In both forms, you tell us who you are (in Section 1), the name of
your contig (Section 2), and you then list the names of all the clones and
probes used in your contig -- don't forget any end probes. 

If you have relatively <a href="#mtp">simple data</a>, which is best
represented as a tiling path, complete a Submit Simple
Contig... Form. If you have more <a href="#Detailed">detailed
results</a>, which include the physical relationships between the
markers and so can be used to draw a more-detailed contig-map, fill in
a Submit Complex Contig... Form. Please note, there is a separate form
to use if you are providing <a
href="/BAC.html"> BAC
mapping-data</a>.

<p>

Please fill in as much information as you can. Most sections are
optional, although some text-input boxes (relating to your name,
<i>etc.</i>) are labelled with "(Required)". These have to be
completed in order for the form to work.

Once you have completed one of these forms, and if you are supplying more
detailed data, then please fill in an TAIR <a
href="/contig_probe.html">Submit
Contig Probe Details Form</a> for each probe in your contig, and an
TAIR <a
href="/contig_clone.html">
Submit Contig Clone Details Form</a> for each clone hybridization used
in your contig for which you have additional details. These may
include such information as the size, type, map location, chimerism,
etc. of individual clones or probes and Southern hybridization
details.

<p>
Unless you are sending us a map in computer format
(see next section), please FAX us a picture of your contig, with the
clones and probes labelled and a scale to:<br>
+1-415-723 7016.<br> Alternatively, please mail us a copy to:<br>
David Flanders, Dept. of Genetics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305-5120, USA.<p>
Please note that the purpose of the FAX is solely to enable us to
check that we are drawing your contig correctly. Please do not use the
FAX as a substitute for filling in sections on these forms.

<center><a name="Gotdata"><b>What do I do if I've already got mapping
data in computer format?</b></center><p>

If you already have some hybridization data in some sort of computer
format, which you think may obviate the need to complete some of the
sections of the forms or be otherwise informative, please e-mail us
<b>before</b> starting on the forms, with details of the type of
computer and program used, type of file, <i>etc</i>., at <a
href="mailto:curator@arabidopsis.org">TAIR Curator</a>. Such
data might include text or spreadsheet (<i>e.g.</i>, Excel) files of clone
type and sizes or maps produced using drawing programs, such as Claris
Draw. 
<p>

<i>SAVING FILES</i><br>
Before sending files (instructions on how to do this follow),
you will first need to save them, from within the program in which you
you created them, in standard format. For example, save:<br>
Word-processor (such as Word) documents as text only and/or rich text
format (rtf);<br>
Spreadsheet (Excel and the like) files as "tab-delimited text";<br>
Graphic (MacDraw Pro, Corel Draw, <i>etc</i>) either as .pict
or .pict2 (Mac) or preferably as .gif (PC, UNIX, Mac -- some programs
or use <a href="http://www.kamit.com/gifconverter.html">
GIFConverter</a>).<p>

 Check that these standard files have all the information in them that
the originals have. This is particularly important with graphics files,
where things occasionally have a nasty habit of moving or changing
colo(u)r. Then send us the files in both the original program's
version and the version saved in standard format.

<p>

<i>SENDING FILES</i><br> You can send files in three different ways:
using <b>ftp</b>, <b>Netscape</b>, or <b>Fetch</b>. These are
explained below. Fetch is the probably the best for Mac users, ftp for
experts, and Netscape for non-experts not using Macs.<p>

Whichever way you send files, please <a
href="mailto:curator@arabidopsis.org">e-mail us</a></b> to let us
know that you've sent your files as we get no automatic notification
of arrivals in our incoming directory.
<p>

<i>Sending via ftp</i><br>
If you know about such things, you can <b>ftp</b> the files to us at:
genome-ftp.stanford.edu in the <a
href="ftp://genome-ftp.stanford.edu/incoming/"> /incoming</a>
directory. Please create a sub-directory in there with your username as
its name. Send text files as ASCII and other files as binary.

<p>
<i>Sending using Netscape</i><br>
You can send files using <b>Netscape</b>, although if you're using a Mac, the
Fetch route, given below, is preferable. Simply connect to the
following URL:<br> <a
href="ftp://genome-ftp.stanford.edu/incoming/">ftp://genome-ftp.stanford.edu/incoming/</a>
and use the "Upload File..." command from the File menu to pick the
files from your computer that you wish to send us.

<p>
<i>Sending using Mac Fetch</i><br>
If you're using a <b>Mac</b>, "
<a href="ftp://ftp.dartmouth.edu/pub/mac/Fetch_3.0.1.hqx">
Fetch</a>" is an easy and reliable way to transfer files. Have
a go and impress your friends. Simply fire up Fetch and from the
"File" menu, select "New connection" and then:<pre>
In the "Host" box, type
        genome-ftp.stanford.edu
In the "User ID" box type
        anonymous
In the "Password" box, type
        your e-mail address (e.g., slave@poorlab.richuni.edu)
In the "Directory" box, type
        /incoming
Press the "OK" button
</pre>

Note the use of lowercase. Once connected, "Create New Directory..."
from Fetch's "Directories" menu giving the directory your e-mail
username (the portion to the left of the "@" sign; no spaces) as its
name. Once you've created and named the directory, double-click on it
to open it (it will, for the moment, be empty).

Then use the "Put File..." button to send us your file. If you
have several files or folders to send us, use the "Put Folders and
Files.." from Fetch's "Remote" menu.<p>

When "Putting" files there are various options that come up in the
"Format" section of the "Put File" window (this pops up once you've
selected your file(s) with "Put"), send ("put") files in the following
ways:<br>
text (or .txt) files send as Text<br>
.gif, .pict, .pict2 send as Raw Data<br>
program files send as Mac Binary II, or BinHex<br>

<p>

With relatively <b>simple</b> mapping- data, such as the
following tiling path,<p>

<center> <img

ALT="[Example MTP]"><p> </center>
<p>
you would enter the following data:

<b>Tip</b>: Use standard (<i>e.g.</i>, g1234) names wherever possible, but
don't worry if the probes or clones are known by other names as alternatives
can be specified in the clone and probe forms.<p>

If you are <b>updating</b> a contig, <i>i.e.</i>, sending further
details on a contig for which you've already sent us data, please
enter <b>all</b> the information on the contig; not just the changed
or new data. (In the near future, we hope to provide a means of
retrieving your old data and adding to it.)

How do I enter mapping-data into the Submit Complex Contig Map Details Form?
</b></center><p>


If you have <b>detailed mapping and hybridization</b> data, which
includes the physical relationship between markers, and you are able
to draw a map to scale, you will first need to determine RELATIVE map
postions of the clones and markers (probes), so we can re-draw your
map.  The crucial thing to do to enable you to do this is to locate
the northern-most (left-most) end of the first CLONE in the contig and
set this as 0 (zero) kb. Measure all distances from the right of this
point as plus (this should be all points).
 <p> 

For example, you would have named the contig below (if on chromosome
IV) "IV g1234 - mi50" and the left end of Clone B would be your zero
point.  (This is the same contig as shown above in the tiling
path, but includes extra information -- specifically the sizes of the
probes and clones and the distances between the markers.)

"Submit Complex Contig Map Details to TAIR" form, would  be:

The reason we ask you to fill in so many forms is two-fold.  Most
importantly for the users of these data -- your fellow reseachers --
to make as much chromosome-walking data available as possible. Second,
to help us in our improvement of TAIR, particularly in our work to
develop a more interactive user-interface to allow better access,
searching and display of physical-map and other genomic information.
