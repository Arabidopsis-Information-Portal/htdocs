Since the first demonstration of induced premeiotic recombination in
higher plants (HIRONO and REDEI 1964) three additional cases of
mitotic exchange of linked markers were detected (Table 1).  If
irradiated plants heterozygous for appropriate markers displayed
visibly different stems, seed was harvested from all branches adjacent
to the sector. The progeny of the yellow sector plant No. 1
contained also green plants because of the chimeric nature of this
stem.  The progenies of the yellow sectors of the other three plants
were free from non- yellow individuals.  In all cases the yellow stem
progenies of plants No. 1, 1224-1 and 1100-6 displayed an excess of gi
while the opposite situation was obvious in plant No.  1111-63.  The
information obtained from the analysis of plant No.  1224-1 is of
special interest.  Unlike the other three cases here in the progeny of
the yellow sector the recombined strand appears normal and the
parental chromosome carries a defect. Thus direct evidence is
available now that the appearance of the yellow sector was not due to
simultaneous deletion of the ch+ and pa markers.  So far, though
several, but only circumstantial evidence supported this
interpretation.  Analysis of adjacent green sectors has shown that
abnormalities occur concomitantly with the appearance of the yellow
parts.  The progenies from the green stem sectors of plants No.  12,
1111-63 and 122-1 contained an excess of pa plants.  In all cases the
frequency of gi plants was higher than expected in these green sector
progenies.  In the case of plant No. 1 it was ascertained that a small
chromosomal defect between ch and pa loci caused the distortion of the
phenotypic ratios.<p>

The probability for finding four coincidences of the appearance of a
yellow sector accompanied by an adjacent anomalous green sector is
(10-2)4.  (The independent occurrence of anomalies affecting
transmission of a specific strand after similar irradiation is about
10- 2.) The premeiotic recombination was clearly demonstrated by the
information obtained from the yellow sector.  It is not known by what
means does this premeiotic exchange come about but a mechanism
identical with meiotic crossing-over appears unlikely.<p>

Complementary products of the exchange have not been identified so far
but their occurrence is suggested by some facts.<p>
