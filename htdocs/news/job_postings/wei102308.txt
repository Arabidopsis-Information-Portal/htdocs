Ph. D. Graduate Research Assistantship in Plant Bioinformatics 
 
 
A graduate research assistantship at the Ph.D. level is available in the laboratory of Dr. 
Hairong Wei at School of Forest Resources & Environmental Science, Michigan 
Technological University (MTU) to develop novel computational approaches for 
inferring gene function via network construction using gene expression data and other 
types of genomic data. Other research options like gene expression data analysis, 
software/database development are potentially available.  The selected candidate will 
acquire training in bioinformatics, and data mining for biological knowledge discovery, 
and also have chance to learn some essential wetlab techniques for conducting research in 
molecular biology if he/she is interested in. 
 
Applicants should have interest in developing a career in bioinformatics/systems biology. 
 Any of those who have a good background in statistics or computer science or both are 
encouraged to apply.  Strong ability in data manipulation using at least one of 
programming language like R/SAS, perl, java, and C is anticipated.  The candidate 
should possess the ability to work independently and the attitude to work cooperatively. 
 A background in either machine learning or (molecular) biology will be a plus, though 
not a requirement.  Additional information and requirements can be found at

Expected starting date:  January 2009 
 
Interested candidates should send a resume highlighting their experience and interests, 
GRE scores (TOEFL is required for international students), names and email addresses of 
three references to Dr. Hairong Wei (hairong@mtu.edu).
