MULLER (1967) treated presoaked seeds of the race Dijon with 50 mM EMS
(3 hrs, 24*degrees*C), then submersed them in water (1 hr or 24 hrs),
and finally dry-stored them (silicagel, 24*degrees*C) during various
periods. After 1 hr water-storage, the genetic damage (M1-sterility,
embryonic lethals and chlorophyll mutants) gradually increased during
the dry-storage from 0 hrs to 56 days In contrast, a drastic decrease
occurred in experiments of MULLER (1965), 1967) with MNU and other
nitrosamides. This author argued in favour of reversion of
premutational lesions during dry-storage, rather than inactivation of
residual MNU or its reaction products.  Our EMS results are at
variance with MULLERs EMS-results, but resemble his MNU results to
some extent.  In addition, we included dry-storage at -20*degrees*C.<p>

After 5 days on wet filterpaper at 2 *degrees*C (a routine procedure
used to break dormancy) and 24 hrs redrying on filterpaper
(24*degrees*C, followed by 5 min rinsing with tapwater.  The post
treatments were: (1) Water-storage, either (W) or not (-).  Seeds
submersed in a large quantity of water (dark, 24 hrs, 24*degrees*C, no
stirring or renewal).  (2) Dry-storage, either (S) or not (-). Drying
for 15 min on filterpaper (room temperature), followed by further
drying and storage (exsiccator, silicagel), either at +24*degrees*C
(S+24) or at -20*degrees*C (S-20), and during 1, 5 or 14 days (S+24/1,
etc.).  Prior to storage at -20*degrees*C a vacuum treatment was
inserted (30 mm 2*degrees*C, 45 min, silicagel). The experiment was so
timed that all items could be silultaneously sown on agar.<p>

The results are shown in the following table, in which "Survival"
means % of treated seeds giving flowering plants (soil, greenhouse),
"Sterility" means % of non-fertilized ovulae, and the mutant
frequencies are given as % of seeds containing lethal embryos (E.L.)
and % of chlorophyll mutants among non-lethal embryos (Chl.; MULLERs
embryo-test).  Per each item the siliques No. 5 and 6 were scored on
35 M1-plants.<p>

Attention should be drawn to the following data: (1) No difference
between (-,-) and (W,-).  Outdiffusion of EMS on agar and under water
at equal rates, or if not, a balance with differential change in
sensitivity to residual EMS. This absence of difference is in
agreement with MULLER (1966), who sowed in soil.  (2) No water-storage
prior to dry storage (-, S+24/1) give an immediate sharp increase in
genetic damage, as compared with (-,-).  In MULLERs (1967) 1 hr
water-storage item, this increase during dry-storage was gradual.  (3)
Even after 24 hrs water-storage (W, S+24/1) the damage increases
(though to a lesser extent), indicating residual EMS.  Here, MULLER
found no increase. (4) Both with- (W, S+24) and without (-, S+24)
water-storage, all three types of damage decrease during dry-storage
(1 to 14 days).  MULLER found constancy resp. increase in his EMS
experiment. The decrease of the three types of damage, from (-,
S+24/1) to (W, S+24/14) has relative proportions which can be
precisely mimicked by a range of decreasing EMS concentrations.  (5)
Dry storage at -20*degrees*C (W, S-20/1) shows a spectrum shift
relative to +24*degrees*C (W, S+24/1), characterized by decreased
sterility and increased numbers of embryonic lethals (the chlorophyll
mutants remain constant).  This shift arises within one day dry
storage and shows no further increase.  It could be due to the
inserted vacuum treatment.  (6) Most surprisingly, the decrease of all
three types of damage is of the same order of magnitude during dry
storage at 20*degrees*C and at 24*degrees*C.  Repair of already
induced lesions or prevention of damage to be induced (e.g., by
residual EMS after sowing) thus resembles a physical process.<p>

In extensive post-treatment experiments with barley seeds GAUL (1966)
used a very high EMS-dose (290 mM, 3 hrs, 24*degrees*C), so that
without postwashing (-,-) all seeds were killed, and no amount of
washing could prevent 100% seed-killing when dry-stored for 14 days at
24*degrees*C.  The only items which were left and which can be
tentatively compared with our Arabidopsis experiment are 24 hrs
washing (running tapwater, 24*degrees*C) and either directly sown in
the field (W,-) or first dried (vacuum, 18 hrs, 40*degrees*C and
dry-stored at 20*degrees*C for 42 days (W, S-20/42). These treatments
gave resp. 11.8 and 16.5 % M1- seedset and resp. 1.4 and 21.0 %
chlorophyll mutants.  This trend is roughly similar to that found by
us for (W,-) versus (W, S-20/14).  It is obvious that several points
of divergence remain to be clarified. Further experiments are being
planned.<p>
