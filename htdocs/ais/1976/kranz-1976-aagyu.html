Since September, 1974, the Secretary of Arabidopsis Information
Service (AIS) was responsible for the organization of the AIS-project,
i.e., documentation and information of the international activities of
exploration, experimentation, and conservation of Arabidopsis, this
model subject of a botanical research.<p>

Therefore a central seed bank based on the well known collections of
F. LAIBACH and G. ROBBELEN was set up in Frankfurt/Main in 1975. At
present this collection includes 10 samples of different Arabidopsis
species, 294 samples of various natural populations of A. thaliana and
538 samples of morphogenetic, and pigment mutant lines.  This material
has been surveyed and catalogues on files of punch cards; presently a
computer program is worked out for these data. Selected types of
species, populations, and mutants are demonstrated in glasshouses
nearby, further information on the AIS-seed bank is given by a
demonstration of slides in the room of the same floor.  Much work has
been done in order to prove the sample quality and character, to
propagate the material in glasshouses, and to conserve the seeds in
refigerators. Samples of this collection were sent out to research
workers in Great Britain, India, USA, USSR, Spain, Israel,
Switzerland, and Belgium.<p>

In editing the volumes No. 11 and 12 of the AIS-newsletter the
Secretary informed more than 200 persons or institutions in about 30
countries on the existence of these genetic resources, and on recent
significant research activities.  These informations include methods,
as well as laboratory research communications dealing with tentative
experimental results and research programs underway. Running lists are
compiled in computer files on the bibliography and on addresses of the
laboratories, respectively scientists working with Arabidopsis round
the world. As it is shown by the map, presently, the international
Arabidopsis research activities are organized in<p>

i) 37 research groups in North, Middle, and South America, and 28
groups in Europe, 4 in Africa, 3 in Near Eastern countries, and about
10 in the Far East.<p>

ii) Seed banks have been established at Columbia/Mo., East Lansing,
Madrid, Leicester, Brussel, Groningen, Frankfurt, Gatersleben, Brunn,
Moscow, and Dushanbe.  Today the number of scientific publications
dealing with this plant nears 1400; about 80 p.c. in English, 10 p.c.
in German, and the rest in French, Russian, Dutch, Japanese, Italian,
Czech, Polish, etc. The complete AIS-bibliography finishing on July
15, 1976, is demonstrated in the exhibition nearby.  It's interesting
to note the various trends in Arabidopsis research over the years
(Figure 1).  Arabidopsis research started at the end of the last
century, increased in the late 60th to a maximum of about 150
publications per year; recently, this value decreased to the mean of
50.  The pronounced peak can be explained by the animating effect of
the 1st Arabidopsis symposium for studying this subject round the
world. Certain trends in the main resarch fields can be shown. While
in taxonomy and population genetics the period of highest activity is
probably over, research in the classical fields still continues;
however, molecular, developmental, and physiological genetics are
fields of further interest.  And last not least the somatic cell
genetics of this subject is a "newcomer".<p>

eight decades since F. LAIBACH's first study in 1907.<p>

Furthermore, announcements on meetings of the scientists interested in
Arabidopsis were given by the Secretariate. During the XIIth
International Botanical Congress at Leningrad in July 1975 an informal
meeting was held in order to give the possibility for discussions,
especially for participants coming from eastern countries, on present
Arabidopsis research activities. Further, intensive correspondence
with several prominent Arabidopsis research workers led to the plan to
organize the second international meeting on Arabidopsis research to
be held at Frankfurt/Main.<p>

This is sometimes hard, but animating work would have never been done
without the generous support of the International Union of Biological
Sciences, especially the late Prof. Dr. EGLE, formerly head of this
department, the helpful cooperation of many colleagues, the
Arabidopsis fans round the world, and last not least the valuable
assistance of Mrs. B. KIRCHHEIM and Miss. B. KREHAHN.<p>
