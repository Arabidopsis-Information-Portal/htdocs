Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of invertase has been developed for
use in studies of the biochemical genetics of invertase production in
Arabidopsis. Both disc gels and vertical slab, gradient gels have been
used successfully and have produced essentially similar banding
patterns.  Only the latter method will be described here since it
gives more consistent results and allows direct comparisons of up to
fourteen different samples on one gel.<p>

A Uniscil four cell electrophoresis apparatus (Universal Scientif
Ltd.) was used with Gradipore continuous concentration gradient
polyacrylamide gels (4 to 26%).  The box buffer was Tris-glycine, pH
8.3, externally cooled to 4*degres*C; gels were pre-run for 45 mintues
before samples were applied.  Upwards of 100 mg of frozen rosette
leaves or roots were ground in cold 0.2M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5,
containing 0.1% w/v*beta*-mercaptoethanol and 10% glycerol at 100u 1
per 100 mg tissue. The superatant was applied to the gel (25 to 45u l
aliquots ) and a constant voltage of 200 V applied for 18 to 20 hours.<p>

After electrophoresis, gels were incubated in McILVAINE
citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 5.4, for 30 minutes, followed by 45
mintues in 0.2 sucrose in the same buffer at 30*degrees*C.  After
washing the gels were stained y the method of GABRIEL and WANG (1969)
for aldose sugar reaction products, using 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride which produces red bands.<p>

The method was established using rosette leaves of race Est and two
bands of activity were consistently located at positions corresponding
to gel concentrations of approximately 11% and 20% respectively.  A
similar two-band pattern was also found after disc gel electophoresis,
but the faster moving band sometimes barely discernible suggesting
that it is more labile than the slower band.<p>

Traditionally, invertase has not been recognized as an amenable enzyme
for electrophoretic study and therefore few comparisons with other
sources of the enzyme are available.  However, BERGGREN (1970) has
analysed purified invertase from brewer's yeast on starch gels.  He
found a broad, slowly-moving band with a number of faster inactive
bands.  It is possible that the slower band from both yeast and
Arabidopsis represents the intact, high molecular weight,
carbohydrate-containing form of the enzyme while the faster, more
labile bands are low molecular weight derivatives and not necessarily
different protein species.<p>

The enzymes from roots and leaves of several races have been analysed
in this system and some variation in mobility has been discovered. The
results are summarised below and in Figure 1.<p>

1) Leaves: The four strains tested so far Est, Ei, En, and St, have
identical first band mobilities. The second band of Est may be
fractionally slower than the second bands of the other strains, but
any difference is very small and requires further analysis.<p>

2) Roots: Two distinct first bands, both faster than the first leaf
band have been found amongst the six strains tested. The faster of
these two (R 2) is produced by roots of Est. Dj and La (erecta mutant)
while the slower band (R 1) is found in roots of St, Ei and En.  Again
there may be slight differences between R 1 band strains which require
further study.<p>

It is now necessary to extend this analysis to other strains, to
discover if this variation is genetic in origin and to establish if
the variation is related to the physiological role of the enzyme.<p>
