This paper deals with the investigation of several Arabidopsis lines
used in our laboratory for obtaining hybrids between chlorophyll
deficient and wild lines in order to determine high temperature
resistance of germinating seeds and their ability to germinate in the
dark.<p>

Seeds of races Co, B1 (subline with a short vegetative period), Est,
Li, Di and two chlorine mutants K-55 and K-52 were kindly supplied by
the Chair of Genetics and Selection of Moscow State University, seeds
of race En - by the Chair of Genetics and Selection of Leningrad State
University. We propagated them in our laboratory. In our experiments
we used two seed batches of race Co harvested in February (batch I)
and March (batch II). We used line Kho isolated by Khurmatov
(Institute of General Genetics Acad. Sci. USSR) from a natural
population collected in Khodga-Obi-Garm of Tadjikistan (altitude 1800
m). The second generation of this line was grown in our laboratory and
in this experiment seeds from one plant were used. When the dormancy
was terminated all seeds were put into desiccator with CaC1 2 and kept
there at 2-4*degrees*C. The experiments were carried out at the
beginning of 1983 the seeds of the following harvests were used: En -
1977; K-55 K-52, Kho - 1981; B1, Est, Di, Li - 1982.<p>

The seeds germinated in 10 cm diameter Petri dishes on mineral Agar
medium. To study the ability of different lines to germinate in the
dark, Petri dishes with 100 seeds in each were put immediately after
sowing into a thermostat at 256+/-0.5*degrees*C in total darkness and
the number of germinated seeds was scored 13 days after. Two
repetitions were made. To study the effect of high temperature Petri
dishes with 50 seeds in each were put immediately after sowing into a
photostat (25+/-0.5*degrees*C, continuous light) for 24 h. Then one of
the two dishes of each line was transferred into thermostat of 40
+/-0.5*Degrees*C or 45+/-0.5*degrees*C (in total darkness) in
preliniary experiments and of 42 +/-0.5*degrees*C - in four basic
experiments for 2 h; another dish being a control was transferred into
thermostat of 25 =/=0.5*degrees*C (in total darkness). Then all the
dishes were returned into the photostat. The numbers of germinated
seeds and seedlings at different developmental phases wers scored 2,
3, 4, 8, and 13 days after sowing.<p>

The data obtained are presented in Table 1. Pronounced differences in
the ability of seeds to germinate in total darkness were observed not
only between various lines but also between two seed batches of race
Co. The highest rates of germination were observed in En (59.5%) and
Kho (56.0%).<p>

The treatment with high temperature during the second day after sowing
was made on swollen seeds which had not yet begun to germinate. In
preliminary experiments the treatments with 45*degrees*C and
40*degrees*C were made only on the seeds of races Co and B1. After the
treating with 45*degrees*C all the Co seeds died and only 12% B1 seeds
germinated 13 days after sowing with all seedlings developing rosette
leaves. After the treatment with 40*degrees*C by the same time 84% of
Co seeds germinated with 3/4 of these seedlings developing rosette
leaves and 96% of B1 seeds germinated with all seedlings developing
rosette leaves. On the basis of these data 42*degrees*C was chosen as
possible critical temperature for survival and the treatment with this
temperature was made on swollen seeds of all 9 lines used in our work.<p>

Summarized results are presented in Table 1. In controls more than 50%
seeds germinated 2 days after sowing in all lines except chlorina
mutants. Germination was stopped under 42*degrees*C treatment because
2 and 3 days after sowing almost no germinated seeds were observed.
The number of germinated seeds 4 days after sowing varied in different
lines from 3.5 to 456.0%. In controls by this time the rate of
germination was close to that observed at the end of the experiment.<p>

Seeds resistance to 42*degrees*C was estimated 13 days after sowing
using 2 indexes: the rate of germinated seeds and the rate of
seedlings developing rosette leaves. Races Est. Li, B1, Di proved to
be the most resistant. Although the rate of germination of En seeds
decreased insignificantly, the rosette leaves developed only in 8.5%
of seedlings compared to 88.0% in control. The rate of germination of
Co seeds decreased about 2 times: to 41.0% in batch I and to 59.0% in
bath II with rosette leaves observed only in 5.5% and 32.5% of
seedlings correspondingly. In chlorina mutants the rate of seedlings
with rosette leaves was rather low: 6.5% in K-55 and 32.5% in K-52.
Line Kho recently selected from natural population showed low
temperature resistance which was close to laboratory race Co.<p>

So temperature 42*degrees*C which was given during the second day
after sowing proved to be a critical temperature for chlorina mutants
K-55 and K-52, recently selected from natural population line Kho and
races Co and En propagated for many years in laboratory. In laboratory
lines Est, Bl, Di, Li temperature 42*degrees*C induced only a delay of
germination. However, the fact that this delay significantly exceeded
the period of temperature treatment indicates that this teperature not
only delayed the germination but influenced negatively the plant
development. The observed difference in resistance to 42*degrees*C may
be explained either by different genetical temperature resistance of
the lines studied or by their different viability or by the fact that
in the period of high temperature treatment the developmental phases
of the germinating seeds of various batches were not the same. At
present the experiments on the study of high temperature during the
whole period of seed germination are carried out and these experiments
will help to determine the validity of the third suggestion.<p>
