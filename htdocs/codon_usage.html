This table is from 1993 and produced with the GCG program CodonFrequency.

<p>
Duplicates, pseudogenes, mutant and synthetic genes were not included.
Coding regions were specified using the Feature Table of each entry, then
checked for accuracy. If more than one stop codon was found the sequence
was not included.
