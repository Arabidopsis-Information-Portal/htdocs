Vol 01S: <h2>The Taxonomic Confusion within Arabidopsis and Allied Genera</h2><p>

Brigitte BERGER<p>

In 1842 HEYNHOLD Taxonomically described the crucifer Arabidopsis
thaliana. But already in 1737 LINNE mentioned this species and named
it in honor to Johannes THAL, who in 1577 had published the first
"Harzflors". Since tht time the taxonomic position of Arabidopsis has
frequently changed. But it seems important to point out just these
reasons, which led different authors to various conclusions concerning
this species. Only in this way we can judge the results which have
been and will be obtained by newer taxonomic methods.<p>

At first the different characteristics of Arabidopsis and allied
genera will briefly be outlined. Within the crucifers the fruits can
be distinguished as siliqua and silicula, and from these Arabidopsis
develops typical siliquas. Furthermore latisept and angustisept forms
can be separated by the position of the septum in the short or long
diameter of the fruit. Other charactristics are the ribs and nervs on
the valves. Arabidopsis thaliana shows only one distinct midrib, and a
reticulate system of veines is scarcely visible. Within the seed
characteristics the different position of the primary root within the
embryo is especially decisive. At transverse sections through seeds of
different cruciferous genera the pleurorhiz, notorhiz and orthoploc
position of the rhizome towards the cotyledones can be noted. The
notorhiz position is typical for Arabidopsis thaliana. As a taxonomic
critrion of the flower the shape of the honey glands is used, which
are found between the stamens on the receptacle.  Finally the
morphology of the stigma, the presence of hairs on the stems and
leaves and their branching are eminent properties. Well known in
Cruciferae are the myrosine-cells, which contain the enzyme
myrosinase. In electron microscopic pictures these cells were shown to
contain a large number of Golgi bodies and mitochondria as well as a
high amount of enclosures in the cytoplasm. The different localisation
of these idioblasts either in the mesophyll (e.g., Arabis hirsuta) or
along the vascular bundle (e.g., Arabidopsis thaliana) is said to be
of particular importance. Recent studies of the chemistry of the
mustard oils within cruciferous plants probably will reveal new
aspects.<p>

As the taxonomic value of each of these characteristics is more or
less subjectively estimated, several entirely different systems have
been published. Consequently the taxonomic position of Arabidopsis and
allied genera is highly confused, which may be ilustrated by the
following four widely differing systems.<p>

I. The system after LINNE, 1737 (Figure 1), contains two groups, which
are characterized by siliqua and silicula respectively.
Characteristics of the genera are the shape of the leaves and the
habitus on the whole. Arabidopsis therefore belongs to the genus
Arabis, which again belongs to the Siliquosae, together with
Cardamine, Sisymbrium and Erysimum. In total the number of observed
properties is so small, that the established genera don't form a
natural group.<p>

II. The system after DE CANDOLLE, 1825 (Figure 2), is based on
entirely different principles than the former. DE CANDOLLE divides the
Cruciferae into five subordines according to the localisation of the
primary root and into tribes according to the structures of the
fruits.  Based on this view, the genus Arabis belongs to the
Pleurorhizeae and Siliquosae. Closely related we find the general
Cardamine and Turritis.  It is interesting, that DE CANDOLLE separates
a section Arabidopsis from the genus Sisymbrieae, which is
characterized by the latisept siliqua.  But probably because of the
small and lineal silique he did not place Arabis thaliana into this
new section. Within this sytem Arabidopsis thaliana is changing
between the genera Arabis, Sisymbrium and Erysimum.  It might belong
to the genus Sisymbrium because of the notorhiz position of the
primary root, to the genus Arabis because of the lineal, compressed
silique and to Erysimum because of the system of veines on the valves
and the position of the primary root. This clearly demonstrates the
limitation of these morphological approaches, for in each genus we
find correspondences in some characteristics as well as differences in
others of equal importance. According to this discrepancy CELAKOVSKY
(1867) justified the establishment of an independent genus, which he
names Stenophragma. Summarizing one could say, that DE CANDOLLE's
system in consequence of the overvaluation of one single property--the
position of the primary root within the embryo- also leads to an
artificial organization of genera.<p>

III. The system after PRANTL, 1891 (Figure 3), is another attempt to
establish natural relationships. In this treatise, however, the stress
is laid on an increased number of characteristics, though the
existence or nonexistence of hairs and their branching type likewise
seems to be overvaluated. According to this character two main groups
are distingished with two tribes each. The tribes are discernable by
the morphology of their stigmas, and characteristics of the subtribes
are the form of the honey glands, fruits and seeds.  Because of the
branched hairs, lineal silique and small septum Stenophragma is
adjoined with the Hesperideae as a genus of the subtribe Turritineae.
In this way justice is given to the taxonomic isolation of
Arabidopsis, but it is separated from near related groups such as
Sisymbrium and Cardamine, including the section Cardaminopsis.<p>

Pflanzenfamilien. III. 2. 1891<p>

With this system in view it might be of interest to cite some
investigations done by LOVKVIST (1957). Cultivating the hairy
Cardamine pubescens at a shaddowy and the glabrous Cardamine
glabrescens at a sunny place, he found that each "species" could be
converted into the other one in so far as the formation of hairs was
concerned. The special taxonomic value of this property is therefore
pretty doubtful.  Nevertheless because of its clarity most of the
recent floras are based on this sytem of PRANTL.<p>

IV. The system after HAYEK, 1910 - 11 (Figure 4), should finally be
mentioned as a quite well-weighted system. Here the genus Arabidopsis
is classified individually by the existence of myrosine-cells at the
vascular-bundles. The taxonomic relations within the system as a whole
run as follows. All the related genera in question are united in the
tribe Arabideae. Arabidopsis, Cardaminopsis and Cardamine are placed
into the subtribe Cardamineae, which differs from the subtribe
Arabidineae by the localisation of the myrosine-cells. In that
subtribe we only find idioblasts in the mesophyll (e.g., in Arabis).
In conclusion this system mostly corresponds to the present idea of
relationships of the genera in question.<p>

These relationships were confirmed by the determination of the
chromosome numbers. In contrast to the genus Arabis, which shows the
basic number of x=8, LAIBACH (1907) determined the chromosome number
of Arabidopsis thaliana as low as n=5. The genus Sisymbrium is
characterized by x=7. Therefore we can include Arabidopsis neither to
Arabis nor to Sisymbrium. JARETZKY (1928) tried to explain the
phylogenetic correspondence as follows: "Vielmehr konnen wir der
Vermutung Ausdruck geben, das Stenophragma durch Bastardierung
zwischen Sisymbrium und Arabis entstanden sei, wobei infolge
ungenugender Bindung der Chromosomen bei der Reducktionsteilung des
Bastards ein Chromosomenverlust eintrat."<p>

If we assume the independence of the genus Arabidopsis, which is
characterized by the species A. thaliana, the question is, which
species belong to this genus? Of course the problem is similar to that
I pointed out above: Which properties determine the membership to this
or that genus? Is it the hairiness, the shape of the honey glands or
perhaps the position of the myrosine-cells and what about the
chromosome numbers?  According to these discrepencies a varying number
of Arabidopsis species are found in the different floras, for example
in the "Flora of URSS" 7 species, in ENGLER-PRANTL "Dan Pflanzenreich"
11 or in HEGI "Flora von Mitteleuropa" 8 species. Figure 5 shows the
species and their synonyms listed after SCHULZ (1924) in "Das
Pflanzenreich". But it remains questionable whether all these forms
really belong to a natural unity.<p>

Summarizing we see, that the problem of the taxonomic position of
Arabidopsis thaliana and allied genera cannot be solved by
morphological and anatomical comparisons only, since the personal
judgement of the different characteristics plays the most prominent
role. Therefore if we want to set up phylogenetic relationships,
surely the best way is directly to prove the genetic homologies
between the species in question. Strange to say, though interspecific
hybridization within the Cruciferae is rather frequent even in nature
and though KARPET-SCHENKO produced the first experimental
allopolyploids within this very family, this cytotaxonomic method,
which is believed to be one of the most significant, has only been
used in a very few cases within Arabidopsis and allied genera up to
now. The results already otbained by this way will be reviwed in the
following lecture of Dr. KRIBBEN<p>
