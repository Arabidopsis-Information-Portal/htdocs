Arabidopsis thaliana has proved to be a very suitable organism for
genetic studies particularly for quantitative and mutational research.
With the development of electrophoretic techniques for studying
isozymes, we have become interested in investigating the adaptive
significance of these variants which often occur with high frequency
in natural populations of plants and animals.  A facet of our research
is concerned with the effect of artificial selection for metrical
characters on the gene frequency of particular isozymes. This note
reports some of our peliminary findings on the incidence of some
isozyme variants among some geographic races of A. thaliana and their
inheritance.<p>

Electrophoretic techniques and staining procedures followed closely
those described by BREWBAKER et al.  (1968).  However, for acid
phosphatases a 1:1 mixture of Fast blue RR and Fast garnet GBC salts
resulted in a superior resolution of bands than when only Fast blue RR
was used.  Peroxidases were detected using a triscitrate gel buffer
(pH 8.6) and the electrolyte consisted of a boric acid - NaQH buffer
(pH 8.2).  The staining procedure involved the use of benzidine (3 x
10E-3M) in 50% solution of ethanol in 7% acetic acid.  Hydrogen
peroxide was added to make a 1.8 x 10E-3M solution (SMITH, 1970).
This technique provides for the rapid appearance of blue coloured
bands which, because of their instabiity, must be readily scored.<p>

Material from different geographic races of A. thaliana has been made
available to us from the Division of Plant Industry, C.S.I.R.O. The
results obtained from the study of three of the races (arbitrarily
designated as L, M and N) with respect to four loci are described
here.  Table 1 gives the genotypes assigned to these races.<p>

the relative mobilities of the enzyme bands)<p>

With the exception of peroxidases which have been determined from root
extracts, the other enzymes were derived from extracts of rosette
leaves.<p>

A study of hybrids, F2 and back-cross families involving these three
races indicates a single gene difference for each of the enzymes. The
peptidases and peroxidases are monomeric proteins with heterozygotes
recognised by the presence of the two parental bands; however,
heterozygotes for the acid phosphatase and transaminase loci have an
additional band of intermediate mobility which suggests that these
proteins have a dimeric structure.<p>

These and other races of Arabidopsis form parental genotypes for the
development of segregating families of different gene frequencies with
respect to isozyme alleles.  Changes in these gene frequencies will be
followed during selection programs for different metrical traits.<p>
