AGROBACTERIUM PLASMID DNA MINIPREP

From Paul Ebert & G. An (Institute of Biological Chemistry, Washington 
State University, Pulman, WA 99164, U.S.A.), as used by Caroline Dean 
et al. (Caroline Dean, Department of Molecular Genetics, The Cambridge 
Laboratory, The John Innes Centre for Plant Science Research, Colney 
Lane, Norwich, NR4 7UJ, England.)

1.  SOLUTIONS
  (i) LYSIS BUFFER
50mM Glucose
25mM Tris-Cl pH 5.8
10mM EDTA
4mgml-1 Lysozyme

2.  EXTRACTION
  (i) Inoculate a single colony into 2 ml of LB or YMB containing 
appropriate antibiotics.
 *  Set up 3 or 4 cultures and combine the cells.

  (ii) Incubate shaking at 28oC until culture reaches stationary stage (o/n 
to 3 d).
  (iii) Spin 1.5 ml of cells in 4 or 5 Eppendorf tubes for 3 min in a 
microfuge at 14,000rpm.
  (iv) Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellets in a total 
volume of 100 ul of ice cold Lysis buffer, vortex.
 *  Add a small spatula of Lysozyme to 1 ml of Lysis Buffer immediately 
prior to use.  Break up  the pellets by drawing the solution up into a 
Gilson repeatedly.

  (v) Vortex for 10 sec and incubate at r.t. for 30 min.
 *  Should go beige and slimy.

  (vi) Vortex, add 200 ul of 0.2M NaOH, 1.0% SDS.  Mix by gentle 
shaking.
 *  Make 0.2M NaOH, 1.0% SDS immediately prior to use.

  (vii) Incubate at r.t. for 10-30 min (the longer the incubation the better).
  (viii) Add 150 ul of cold 3M NaOAc, pH 4.8.  Mix by shaking and 
incubate on ice for 5 min.
 *  Should go white and fluffy.

  (ix) Spin for 5 min in a microfuge at 14,000rpm.
 *  Should see white scum on surface.

  (x) Remove supernatant to a fresh tube and add an equal volume of 
phenol:chloroform 1:1.  Mix by shaking.
  (xi) Spin for 5 min in a microfuge at 14,000rpm.
  (xii) Remove top phase to a fresh tube.  Add 1ml of absolute EtOH -
20oC and mix by shaking.
  (xiii) Spin for 5 min in a microfuge at 14,000rpm.
  (xiv) Remove the EtOH and wash the pellet in 1 ml of 70% EtOH -20oC.
  (xv) Spin for 3 min in a microfuge at 14,000rpm.
  (xvi) Remove EtOH and dry pellet under vacuum.
  (xvii) Resuspend pellet in 50 ul of TE.
 *  Mix in pellet by drawing up onto a Gilson repeatedly.
