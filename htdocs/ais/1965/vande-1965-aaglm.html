Vol 01S: <h2>Genes for Late Flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana</h2><p>

J. H. Van der VEEN<p>

The different races of Arabidopsis thaliana vary widely in flowering
time, from very early to very late, the latter being referred to as
"winterannuals", though they do flower without vernalization
treatment, at least when the daily light sum is sufficiently high.<p>

Clearcut single-gene differences for early versus less early and
medium late "summerannuals" have been reported by HARER (1951); and
for early versus late "s.a." (e.g., race Zu; for symbols see ROBBELEN,
1965) by DIERKS (1958), and by NAPP-ZINN (1963). The allele for later
was partly or completely dominant. Under short day (low light sum)
conditions, the presence of modifiers came to light (HARER, 1951).
Under these conditions, early x late crosses were also analysed by
SEYFFERT (1960), who used the statistical approach of quantitative
genetics, with however ".... generally negative experimental
results....".<p>

Crosses between early and very late (="w.a.") were first studied by
LAIBACH (1943) and seemed more complex: for Li-5 x St ("w.a."), NAPP-
ZINN (1957) assumed 2, or perhaps 3, unidentified major genes, when
judging by position on the scale and by segregation type of some of
his F3 and F4 families; but later (1962) he arrived at a minimum of 4
unidentified loci, when judging by the number of Li-5 like lines which
could be selected from the backross to Li-5.<p>

DIERKS (1958) found the F1 of early races with some less early races,
to be heterotic towards late. He studied in particular the cross En x
Ct w.b., and adopting the dominance model of heterosis, he concluded
to one dominant major gene for later flowering (from Ct w.b.)  and an
unknown number of dominant modifiers (from En), jointly leading to
pronounced heterosis in F1.<p>

These studies relate to the problem of earliness in general, and to
the mechanism of heterosis in self-pollinators. Moreover, in a species
like Arabidopsis thaliana, flowering time and, highly correlated to
it, number of leaves, are a major component of morphological
differentiation, and of local (ecological) adaptation.  Cf. a.o.
LAIBACH (1943, and later), RATCLIFFE (1964), CETL et al.  (1965) . The
need for more detailed genetical information is obvious.<p>

In the following, it will be shown that in the cross Di(early) x Li-2
(less early), 2 complementary-like major genes are involved.<p>

Material and Methods: The races Dijon and Limburg-2 were kindly made
available by Professor LAIBACH. The germination and transplanting
technique (designed to reduce non-genotypic variation) has been
described by Van der VEEN (1965), and the crossing technique by
FEENSTRA (1965).<p>

The plants grew in an airconditioned greenhouse (20-22*degrees*C; rel.
hum. round 70), and were sufficiently spaced to avoid competition.
Except in midsummer, assimilation light (Philips TL 55, 4000 lux) and
photoperiodic light (incandescent bulbs, 60 W/m2) were added, both
continuously. For phenotypic classification, the autumn-winter
environment was the more favourable one, since it generated larger
differences between genotypes (Table 1), whilst variation within
genotypes increased less than proportionally, provided long day is
simulated (addition of incandescent bulbs).  Natural short day (only
continuous TL 55 added) seems to relatively inflate nongenotypic
variation. This observation, however, I did not cheque by systematic
experiments.<p>

Table 1: Mean flowering time of parents, F1 and the 2 new homozygotes in
different seasons<p>

Since germination was synchronized, a.o. by adding a trace of KNO3 to
the agar, flowering time was measured in days from the end of cold
treatment (used for breaking seed dormancy) to the day of first open
flower. The autumn and winter sets of families show identical
flowering time ranges (Table 1), and therefore it was not necessary to
resort to comparisons corrected by means of leaf production per day,
which is cumbersome to measure with the later genotypes.<p>

Experimental Results: A prior experiment (uncontrolled greenhouse) had
shown 1) that the F1 of Di (early) and Li-2 (less early) was heterotic
throughout the year, 2) that the F2 gave transgression far past the
F1, and 3) that the F2 perhaps indicated a 7:9 bimodality. In some 120
F3 and F4 families (airconditioned greenhouse), the positions of the
frequency peaks led to the hypothesis of 2 major genes controlling
flowering time. These generations, however, are rather inefficient
(many sufficiently large progenies needed), and do not allow
identification of genotypes. After selecting from the F3 two classes
of lines, viz. lines like S96 and lines like S189, flowering
respectively uniformly earlier than Di and uniformly later than the F1
(see Table 1), and after selfing these for 3 generations, a genetical
analysis was made based on a diallele cross design. This is, all 6
F1's between S96, Di, Li-2, and S189 were made reciprocally, and
further the coresponding F2's and the 4 backcrosses gave identical
results. Since, moreover, no reciprocal differences were found, sets
of corresponding families have been pooled in the following.<p>

The means of the 4 lines and their F1's are given in Table 2, to which
for ease of presentation the hypothesis-to-be-tested has been added,
including an expected phenotypic classification, corresponding to the
phenotypic ratio of 9 : 3 : 4 in F2. It should be noted that the very
early line S96 is not heterotic with either Di or Li-2.  Inspection of
Figure 1 (digenic F2), Figure 2 (monogenic F2's), and Figure 3
(backcrosses) shows that all expected (1, 2 or 3) phenotypes of all
segregating families are represented by clear frequency peaks in those
positions on the scale which were expected on the basis of parents and
F1s. An impression of the segregation ratios was obtained by
interpolation between the frequency peaks, and the numerical results
(Table 3) are conform expectation. The joint data are proof for 2
complementary-like major genes. No linkage could be detected.<p>

To facilitate the cross-comparing of Table 2 and Figures 1, 2, and 3,
the following points may be specified.<p>

1) The most striking contrast is produced by the dominant gene B (from
Li-2) in the presence of A; with aa its effect is less pronounced,
though still distinct (see e.g. the F2 from S96 x Li-2 in Fig 2). In
fact, S96 was selected from an F3 segregating like this F2.<p>

2) The segregation of A-a cannot be distinguished in the presence of
bb.  In fact, a cross like Di x S96 has been erroneously considered by
me as a typical case of quantitative (polygenic) inheritance. In the
presence of B, gene A is partly dominant. The segregation of A-a is
suggested by the middle peak in the digenic F2 (Figure 1), but it
becomes more clearly manifest in the monogenic F2 from Li-2 x S189
(Figure 2; A/a, BB), and also in the backcross to Li-2 (to aaBB in Fig
3). The latter two families are the main evidence for A-a (see
"Discussion").<p>

homozygotes. Autumn experiment. Arrows indicate means of, from left to
right, Li-2= aaBB and F1= AaBb<p>

3) Among the four A. B. - genotypes, no classification was feasible,
though there was a distinct dose effect: compare e.g., the backcross
to S189 with the other 3 backcrosses (Figure 3). At the late end of
the scale, the effect of additional modifiers becomes manifest, since
a number of S189-like selections from the F2 (Di x Li-2), differ
consistently in flowering time, sometimes as much as 10 days. However,
compared to the 2 major genes, modifiers play only a secondary role,
at least in the present environment.<p>

Some further aspects of the inheritance of flowering time, which
however still require more detailed studies, are the observation that
the early race Li-5, like Di, gives heterosis when crossed to Li-2,
but, unlike Di, is not heterotic with NAPP-ZINN's late selection H51
and H53 (both from Li-5 x St). In close analogy, DIERKS (1958) found
both En and Di to give heterosis with Ct w.b. (cf. Li-2), but with the
late race Zu only Di was heterotic. In addition to this, I selected in
a small F2 from Li-5 x Di a plant which unlike its two parents was not
hetrotic with Li-2.<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol01S/vol01S-pg67-tab3.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

The hypothesis for further experiments is now that early races may be
aabbcc (S96 ?), aabbCC (Li-5?), and AAbbCC. These will not be
heterotic among each other, but will (except for aabbcc) give
heterosis in combination with the less early, basic
late-flowering-gene B containing type aaBBcc (cf. Li-2). Finally,
races like Zu and H51 and H53 may then be aaBBCC.<p>

Discussion: The 2 major genes for flowering time, found in the cross
Di x Li-2, show a complementary-like (or strictly speaking crytomeric)
interaction. There is, however, no objection to speak of 2 dominant
genes in dissociation over the parents, leading to a heterotic F1,
followed in the F2 by transgression past F1. The two descriptions are
not contradictory, which becomes the more clear when a logarithmic or
square root scale is used.<p>

Now DIERKS' cross En x Ct w.b., mentioned in the "Introduction",
behaves in all derived families very similar to Di x Li-2, and leaving
semantics apart, his interpretation is basically the same, viz. En =
H1H1H2H2.....HxHx bb and Ct w.b. = h1h1h2h2.....hxhx BB. In the
backcross to En, he found a 1 : 1 ratio (due to B-b), but he could not
classify in the backcross to Ct w.b. (in contrast to our backcross to
Li-2), and moreover, he did not have crosses like S189 x Li-2.
Therefore, he could not decide how many genes were segregating in
addition to B-b. It is now tempting to speculate that En containing
one single gene C, which has a smaller effect than gene A from Di.<p>

The identification of 2 genes for flowering time may provide an
effective key for the further unraveling of the rather elusive
genetics of flowering time in Arabidopsis.<p>

A Note on Vernalization Response: Germination, or rather the
physiological state during germination is a prerequisite for
successful seed vernalization. Erratic results may follow, when at low
temperatures seeds of the same genotype or of different genotypes vary
to a large extent in germination speed or do not germinate at all.
Germination speed, both with normal and low temperatures, depends on
genotype and on a number of largely obscure maternal and environment
factors, which affect a.o. after ripening and seed dormancy. These
factors can be eliminated by strictly synchronizing germination (see
Van der VEEN, 1965). Vernalization treatment is then started just
before visible germination.<p>

Following this procedure, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks cold treatment (2-
4*degrees*C, dark) was applied to the isogenic lines of Table 1.
Flowering time became progressively earlier, except for the earliest
line (S96) which did not respond. The order of flowering, however,
stayed the same. Moreover, a set of 120 F3 families was grown both
vernalized (4 weeks) and unvernalized, timed so as to make S96 of the
two sets flower simultaneously. Again, no appreciable shifts in the
order of flowering time could be detected. This means that
vernalization requirement (or response) of the genotypes derived from
Di x Li-2 coincides with and is reflected by differences in flowering
time under normal circumstances. However, in other material,
differences in flowering time seem to arise after moderate
vernalization, which were not present in the univernalized control
plants. To study the latter class of genes, it is necessary to first
analyse those genes which lead to differences in flowering time
without vernalization.<p>

Summary: The races Digon and Limburg-2 differ in 2 major genes for
flowering time. The basic gene B (from Li-2) shows a
complementary-like interaction with gene A (from Di), which results in
heterosis in F1 and transgression in F2. The results are compared with
those of DIERKS (1958), and a hypothesis for further studies has been
forwarded. A note on vernalization response has been added.<p>

Discussion<p>

BROWN: Do you know something about the relation between these two
genes?<p>

Van der VEEN: I did not detect significant linkage in the segregating
families. The genotypic frequency, of course, was obtained by
graphical interpolation and not by progeny testing.<p>

BROWN: What do you know about race Estland? Is flowering time
sensitive to these different light intensity conditions during
continuous illumination? - I am interested because I only use constant
high light intensity in continuous illumination. Under these
conditions normal plants and late flowering mutants of race Estland
are easily distinguished. The temperature is a constant 25 *degrees*C,
however, though the late flowering mutant is temperature sensitive,
flowering in race Estland is not temperature sensitive in the range
24*degrees*C.<p>

Van der VEEN: My experience is limited to growing conditions at
21-23*degrees*C. Classification in crosses with Estland too, seems
optimal at lower assimilation light intensity combined with continuous
photoperiodic light. Light intensity, however, becomes only important
for classification when relatively small flowering time differences
are involved.<p>

NAPP-ZINN: In Arabidopsis there are certainly genes for late
flowering, which induce a certain vernalization requirement, that
means that they are responsible for acceleration of development after
cold treatment, while there are other genes for late flowering, which
cannot be overcome by vernalization, and thus induce late flowering
even after vernalization.<p>

Van der VEEN: I should like to have such genotypes.<p>

NAPP-ZINN: I suppose, that strains of this kind might be found among
the so-called summer annuals, since the summer annuals, too, differ
with regard to the date of flowering and many of them cannot be
accelerated by vernalization.<p>

Van der VEEN: So far, I found both late and early varieties to respond.<p>

NAPP-ZINN: With the latter, I am not sure, whether the difference is
statistically significant.<p>

Van der VEEN: On a "physiological time scale", one or two days
difference in chronological time may for very early varieties mean as
much as some weeks for the late ones.<p>

NAPP-ZINN: Surely certain processes already start during vernalization
and go on at a relatively low rate, for, as everybody knows, all
biological processes follow the Van't HOFFs law, and then certain
processes which lead to flower formation also at 20*degrees*C may
already work during vernalization at a much lower rate. Therefore it
is not astonishing if a non-cold requiring plant flowers one day
earlier after a cold treatment on the seed stage than without such an
exposure to cold.<p>

Van der VEEN: I came across an additional complication. Some
selections I found not to respond to vernalization, but these had not
germinated by the end of treatment, that is they had not reached the
sensitive stage. When fulfilling after-ripening requirement
beforehand, they did respond. Lack of after-ripening seemed to have
interfered with breaking seed dormancy by the cold treatment.<p>

NAPP-ZINN: In the experiments, I have done with the races Stockholm
and Limburg-5, no after-ripening requirement was evident. I wonder how
this after-ripening requirement might have been induced in your
experiments, for under certain conditions of ripening, dormancy might
occur while at others it does not.<p>

Van der VEEN: A race like "Dijon" I always found to need cold
treatment for breaking seed dormancy. Otherwise, one obtains complete
germination only in seeds of up to 10 months old.<p>

NAPP-ZINN: You described here the case, that one strain or one line
didn't respond to seed vernalization as a consequence of this
after-ripening requirement not being satisfied. On the other hand I
have strains like "Zurich", in which vernalization and shortening of
after- ripening requirement occur simultaneously under the influence
of cold.  If you harvest the seeds and sow them and keep them cold,
after-ripening requirment will be satisfied as well as vernalization
requirement.<p>

REDEI: I would like to ask you, if someone had already X-rayed this
late ecotype to get early types. By that way one could delete the
dominant factors and estimate more accurately the number of active
genes.<p>

Van der VEEN: It may be that the whole contrast between early races
and late ones like "Stockholm" just depends on 3 loci.<p>

NAPP-ZINN: With regard to REDEI's question, whether someone has
already X-rayed such late genotypes, I think nobody has.<p>

REDEI: If these dominant genes could be knocked out the late race
should become earlier.<p>

Van der VEEN: This is surely a different approach from trying to find
a discriminating environment. But I'm not sure how this method would
work, since the action of some genes can only be seen in the presence
of others. I recall now, that you have mutated a gene for later
yourself, when producing the mutant "erecta", which is five days
earlier than the parent race "Landsberg".<p>

NAPP-ZINN: To terminate this question, I might say, that among the
different genes of the strain Stockholm there is a certain amount of
epistasy and hypostasy, and if you would knock out a hypostatical gene
for vernalization requirement, you wouldn't notice anything. At least
I found also, as you did, certain phenomena of hypostasis in
vernalization genes. For instance one of the two vernalization genes
of H53 is hypostatical to the other, and the epistatical one is
identical with the vernalization gene of H51.<p>
