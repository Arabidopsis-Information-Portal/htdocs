A postdoctoral position is available to study plant-insect interactions in Georg Jander's lab at the Boyce Thompson Institute. 
Genetic, biochemical, and insect behavior research approaches will be used to study natural variation in maize resistance to 
aphids and rootworms. Responsibilities of the successful applicant will include the design and implementation of laboratory 
and field experiments related to maize-insect interactions. Development of additional areas of interest within the scope of 
the project is encouraged. The research will also involve close interactions with engineers at Cornell University who are 
developing automated insect detection systems for laboratory and agricultural applications. The position will be filled as 
early as January, 2010, and funding is available for three years. Candidates with backgrounds in genetic mapping and quantitative 
genetics are particularly encouraged to apply. The Boyce Thompson Institute is a private not for profit research organization 
located on the campus of Cornell University in the scenic Finger Lakes region of upstate New York. Information about the institute 
and its facilities can be found at <http://bti.cornell.edu/>http://bti.cornell.edu.  BTI is an equal opportunity employer. If 
interested, please send a description of prior research experience, career goals, curriculum vitae, and contact information for
