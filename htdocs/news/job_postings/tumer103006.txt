Postdoctoral Research Associate position
Rutgers University
New Brunswick, NJ

A postdoctoral research associate position is available at the Biotech Center at Rutgers 
University to study programmed cell death induced by ribosome inactivating proteins, ricin 
and Shiga-like toxin from E. coli O157:H7.  Both toxins depurinate the highly conserved 
sarcin/ricin loop of the large rRNA, inhibiting translation.  We set up yeast as a simple 
and genetically tractable system to isolate mutants defective in cytotoxicity of ricin A 
chain (RTA) and isolated a panel of nontoxic mutants based on their inability to kill yeast 
cells.  Ribosomes were depurinated in yeast cells expressing the precursor form of RTA (preRTA) 
and these cells displayed apoptotic markers such as nuclear fragmentation, chromatin 
condensation and accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Analysis of the nontoxic ricin 
mutants provided the first evidence that the ability to depurinate ribosomes and inhibit 
translation does not always correlate with ricin-mediated cell death, indicating that 
ribosome depurination and translation inhibition do not account entirely for the cytotoxicity 
of ricin.  A postdoctoral research associate is sought for an NIH funded position to 
characterize the interaction of ricin A chain with ribosomes using the Biacore 4000 and 
the mechanism of its cellular toxicity in yeast and in mammalian cells. Qualifications 
include a Ph.D. in a related field, experience with RNA biochemistry and molecular biology 
and demonstration of an active publication record.  Please send CV and the names and 
addresses of three references to Dr. Nilgun Tumer, Biotech Center, Foran Hall, Cook College, 
Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ 08901-8520.
