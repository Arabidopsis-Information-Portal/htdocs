The mapping of genes on a linkage map has become increasingly relevant
by the development of molecular genetic procedures that allow the
isolation of genes (as DNA) when they are located closely to genes for
which isolated DNA is available. Arabidopsis is especially suitable
for these approaches because of the small size of its genome
(Meyerowitz and Pruitt, 1985). To do this, DNA markers such as
restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers have to be
mapped also in relation to the existing linkage map (Koornneef et al.,
1983; Koornneef, 1987). For reasons of efficiency, scoring should be
done for as many markers as possible in a single population.<p>

In this report we describe a genotype (called W100) that is homozygous
recessive for ten marker genes, two located on each of the five
Arabidopsis chromosomes. This genotype was constructed by combination,
in a number of successive generations, of homozygous recessive mutants
available from our mapping program (Koornnef and Hanart, 1983). Line
W100 is in the Landsberg "erecta" genetic background and its marker
genes are listed in Table 1. All are distinguishable in each others
background. When grown under normal growing conditions they can be
scored unambiguously. All these genes have been used extensively in
the construction of the Arabidopsis linkage map, which implies that
their map position (Table 1, Figure 1) is firmly established.<p>

Figure 2: The minimal population size required to detect linkage for
testcrosses (TC) F 2 populations in coupling phase (F 2C), repulsion
phase (F 2 R) and F 2's in which the heterozygote at one of the two
loci is intermediate (F 2H). For X 2 (P<0.05) = 3.841, also with F 2 H
(!)<p>

For locating a recessive mutant only the F 2 (repulsion) will ve
available. With a dominant mutant both F 2 (coupling) and testcrosses
(with the marker line as the background parent) can be used. For
mutants with intermediate heterozygots (including RFLP markers) both
testcross and F 2's are useful.<p>

It can be seen from Figure 2 that recombination fractions of r<0.35
are detectable at reasonable manageable population sizes. When
correcting r=0.35 for double cross overs with the Kosambi mapping
function (see Koornneef et al., 1983) this results in a map distance
of 43.4 cM. As linkage at this distance around the markers of W100 can
be detected with a high probability it can be seen (Figure 1) that
only genes located on a central part of chromosome 1 and the distal
part of chromosome 3 may escape detection.<p>

Once linkage have been detected one can estimate r from F 2 data
either by maximum likelihood or by the Product Ratio Method using the
tables of Stevens (1939). See e.g., Mather (1951). For also applying
the Product Ratio Method in case of mutants with intermediate
heterozygotes, phenotypes can be pooled to give a coupling phase F 2
which hardly reduces the accuracy of the estimate of r.<p>
