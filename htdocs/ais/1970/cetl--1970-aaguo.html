Some years ago, a series of experiments in developmental physiology
and genetics was started in our Department.  As so far the technique
of cultivation and scoring was not yet published in detail it might be
of interest to give some more important aspects here.<p>

The main objective of the following procedures is to achieve the
highest possible uniformity of germination and of further development
and, thereby, to reduce all possible sources of non-genetic variation
in determining the flowering time and other developmental characters
in both, unvernalized and vernalized conditions.  At the same time,
the simplest method is preferred avoiding laborious operations
(presowing preparation of seeds, transplantation of seedlings, etc.).
In short, all exacting requirements (cf. Van der VEEN, 1965, 1967)
should be fulfilled with relatively non-exacting means.<p>

The vessels from pressed material are 60 cm wide, 30 cm deep and 6 cm
high with 12 holes in the bottom.  They are furnished with a paraffin
layer on the internal walls and filled with a 2 cm high layer of
coarse sand and with a 4 cm high layer of a soil mixture (3 parts of
garden soil, 3 parts of compost soil and 1 part of sand, all fractions
approximately 2 mm in diameter).  The filled vessels are irrigated and
allowed to stand for 24 hours.  The seeds are sown in 16 to 20 rows
(parallel with the shorter side of the vessel) with 16 to 20 pits each
0, 8 cm deep so that 256 to 400 plants fit in.  The density of the
sowing is dependent on the aim of the experiment and on the expected
size of plants.  (If small plants of early forms are grown the density
can be higher, and vice versa.)<p>

Uniform germination is secured (1) by the choice of the suitable
period after harvest when the dormancy of the seeds is already broken
(a preliminary trial on wet filter paper is often necessary), or (2)
by a simple procedure with cooling the seeds after sowing. The vessles
covered by glass plates 60 x 30 cm padded with wooden laths 30 x 1 x
0,5 cm are placed for 24 hours in a dark cooling box at +1 to
+3*degrees*C.  This period is sufficient to achieve for the seeds a
full and regular imbibition with water without starting the
germination process (unpublished data).  Then, the covered vessels are
placed in the growing room with constant conditions of temperature and
light: 25+3*degrees*C and continuous illumination given by
incandescent bulbs, 1250 lux.  (The reasons for the choice of the
given regime see CETL, DOBROVOLNA, and EFFMERTOVA, 1969.)  After 3 to
4 days, in the average, very uniform germination sets in.  The
germination of each seed is scored individually during the regular
daily inspection practised between 10 and 11 hours a.m. not only
throughout the period of germination but during the entire course of
the experiment.<p>

Only if the young cotyledons are stretched into the horizontal
position the seed is taken for germinated to the given date.  In
simple experiments, the date of germination is determined
comprehensively for the whole specimen according to the date when the
majority of the seeds germinate.  In more exact experiments, the
plants germinating each day are marked with signs (3x0,5cm) placed
left from the plant.  All evaluations are then related to this date.
In both cases, the plants germinating three days or later after the
date of maximum germination are not taken into account.  If it
concerns to single (usually weak) plants (up to 3 percent) they are
removed; if the portion of such plants is higher the experiment is to
be repeated in the next convenient term.<p>

In vernalization experiments the vessels with the sown seeds, covered
with the glass plates, are placed in the cooling room for 24 hours as
above; but this time they are first kept at 25 +/- 3*degrees*C and in
continuous illumination (1250 lux) for the next 24 hours. The reson
for this treatment is the same as that given by Van der VEEN (1965).
Only after this procedure, the vessels are placed in the dark with the
vernalization temperature (+2 +/- 1*degree*C).  During the
vernalization, the vessels are not irrigated so that the hypocotyl
growth is inhibited at higher vernalization rates, where the seeds
already start to germinate.  In experiments with gradually increasing
vernalization rates (up to 80 days), the seeds are sown successively
so that the vernalization of all variants can be finished at the same
date.  Then, the vessels are transferred into the growing room.  As
the plants of variants, where the seeds already germinated, are very
susceptible the vessels are transferred gradually, whereby both
temperature and intensivity of illunination are increasing.  Only
after 10 to 12 hours from the end of the vernalization, the vessles
can be placed on the definitive place in the growing room.  The
determination and scoring of germination is not different from the
experiments without vernalization.  In seeds already germinating
during the vernalization, the date of germination corresponds to the
date of the end of vernalization.<p>

Further care of the plants.  After full germination the glass plates
and wooden laths are removed.  When the cotyledons are approximately 3
mm above the soil surface the pits are filled with the above mentioned
soil mixture.  The cultures are irrigated both between rows and plants
two times daily: before the inspection and in the afternoon.<p>

The determination of the number of days to appearance of the flower
primordia.  As the appearance of the flower primordia in the middle of
the leaf rosette is the first well defined and well observable sign
that the flower formation is accomplished, we take this date for the
determiantion of earliness.  The later stages of the flower
morphogenesis appear to be less advantageous, in so far as they
lengthen the course of experiments and can be influenced by factors
only indirectly connected with the developmental processes.  To the
time of the daily inspection, we carefully roll off the highest
rosette leaf and search with naked eye for the presence of the first
flower primordium which can be well distinguished from a leaf
primordium by its roundish shape and paler colour.  This stage is not
necessarily connected with the elongation of the first stem
internodium.  Only in early forms, the flower primordia appear
simultaneously with this elongation.<p>

The determination of the number of rosette leaves.  The number of
rosette leaves can often be counted at the same time as the flower
primordium appears.  In doubtful cases, the plants are marked with
signs as above and the accurate number is determined the next day.
The two cotyledons are included.  In late forms, the lower rosette
leaves die away before counting.  In such cases, it is necessary to
count carefully the rest of the petioles or the traces of them.<p>

In some experiments, plants can be removed after scoring.  If it is
necessary to obtain ripe seeds the plants are marked with signs placed
right from the plant and furnished with corresponding data.<p>

Valuable and well comparable data result from the fulfillment of all
given procedures so that in homozygous specimens the results as to the
number of days to appearance of the flower primordia and the number of
rosette leaves show minimum variability.<p>
