Independent Research Fellowships available at the John Innes Centre,
Norwich, UK

The John Innes Centre is actively encouraging Independent Research
Fellows to consider undertaking their fellowships at JIC, where they can
benefit from our outstanding facilities and excellent research base.  We
are therefore inviting researchers who hold or are intending to apply
for Independent Fellowships (e.g. BBSRC David Phillips Fellowships) to
take part in a Conference on 4/5 June 2007 to see at first hand our
facilities and meet our staff. Researchers who are invited to take part
in this Conference will have the opportunity to give a presentation of
their work and attend an interview to discuss their science and career
plans. 

We will offer suitable applicants the opportunity to either relocate
their Fellowship to JIC or offer guidance to those who are applying for
Independent Fellowships to be held at JIC. On successful completion of a
Fellowship, JIC will consider offering tenure track positions depending
on the appropriateness of the research to our long-term plans.

Research Fellows will be encouraged to participate fully in the
activities of their host Department at JIC and will be assigned a mentor
to assist with the integrative process and career development. There are
also excellent opportunities for researchers to develop their scientific
and transferable skills training.

Eligibility Requirements:

*	A relevant PhD, and experience at post-doctoral level 
*	An excellent publication record (or other proof of research
success) 
*	A coherent and well-developed research plan

Offers of a place will be dependent upon researchers holding or gaining
a Fellowship that will fully fund their position.
