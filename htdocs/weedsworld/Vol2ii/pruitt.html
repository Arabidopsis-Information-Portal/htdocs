<H2>Session 3:  Development II - Post-embryonic</H2>
<P>
<B>Chair: Bob Pruitt, Harvard University</B><P>
<hr>
This somewhat inappropriately named session was composed 
of 6 talks, all of which had to do with the development and/or function 
of the reproductive system.  
<p>
The session began with a talk by Daphne Preuss 
who described her
continuing work on genetic control of the reproductive 
process.  She described
the isolation of new mutations which suppress the sterility 
phenotype of
specific cer mutations. In addition, she described a 
combination of two
mutations which produces pollen tubes which are incapable 
of being correctly
guided to the ovules.  <P>

The second talk, given by Patty Springer, described 
the
use of a gene trap transposon system to isolate a mutation 
which affects the
development of the female gametophyte as well as the 
embryo.  Cloning of the
gene revealed it to have homology with MCM2, MCM3 and 
MCM5 genes of yeast,
genes which are required for the initiation of DNA replication.

Animesh Ray
spoke next, describing further work with the bel and 
sin mutations, as well as
the isolation of novel mutations which alter sporophytic 
or gametophytic
tissue development within the ovule.  <P>

The fourth talk would have been given by
Kay Schneitz who unfortunately missed the session due 
to a cancelled Swissair
flight.  Kay was to report on progress to saturate the 
genome for ovule
development mutations, a project begun in the Pruitt 
lab which is now
approaching completion.  <P>

The two final talks were chosen from the poster
abstracts and were given by David Smyth and Ueli Grossniklaus. 
 David
described the crabs claw mutation which results in a 
failure of the upper part
of the gynoecium to fuse properly.  The gene has been 
cloned in David's
laboratory and encodes a small protein which appears 
to have a single zinc
finger motif.  Ueli Grossniklaus further described the 
Cold Spring Harbor
groups efforts to isolate both gene trap and enhancer 
trap lines,
concentrating on those which are expressed in the developing 
ovule.  Ueli
showed micrographs of the expression patterns of a number 
of lines, including
ones that showed expression which was clearly limited 
to small regions of the
developing sporophytic tissues.<P>
