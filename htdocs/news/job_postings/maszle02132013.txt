* Design, implementation and support of internal sequence database 
  infrastructure; 

* Curation and maintenance of automated database update and 
  BLAST-related resources; 

* Maintenance and extension of internal Galaxy bioinformatics platform; 

* Execution of ad hoc sequence-analysis requests such as promoter 
  identification, cloning primer design, etc. 

* Preparation of phylogenetic trees, alignments and other analyses to 
  support patent filings; 

* Discovery and characterization of sequences of functional 
  orthologues across multiple targets species; 

* Discovery and characterization of sequence motifs related to loci of 
  interest; 

* Development of novel algorithms and methods for the analysis of 
  genomic data, including ORA, GWAS and eQTL analysis; 

* Maintenance and extension of automated multiple-genome primary 
  analysis pipelines for next-generation sequencing data; 

* Integration and analysis of data from disparate sources, including
