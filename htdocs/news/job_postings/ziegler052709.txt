Postdoctoral Opportunity 
 
 
A Postdoctoral Researcher Position is available in the area of 
RNA silencing and viruses. 
 
Location : IBMP, Strasbourg, France 
 
The successful candidate will join an ongoing programme of work aimed at functional dissection 
of the role of small RNA in tissue tropism of plant viruses. The objective is to unravel a potential 
link between RNA silencing and confinement of poleroviruses to vascular tissues (where these 
viruses are naturally present). To this purpose cell-type specific siRNA profiling of healthy and 
infected Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type will be undertaken and analysed to identify siRNA that 
may target host genes and contribute to viral partitioning and pathogenicity. 
 
Essential scientific skills required are in the fields of molecular biology, plant genetics and 
bioinformatics. Strong motivation, good organisational skills and ability to work in a team are 
requested. 
 
Important: the candidate should hold his/her PhD from a non French University, 
come to work to Strasbourg for the first time 
and be aged of less than 35 years old. 
 
The starting date is between the 1st of september and the 31st of october 2009.
