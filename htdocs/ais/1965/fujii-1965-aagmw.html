Effect of ultraviolet rays of 2537 nm on seedlings was examined.
Seeds were sown on wet filter paper in petri dishes.  About 5 mm long
seedlings were exposed to 1 - 100 min of 100 erg/mm 2/sec intensity
and were kept in a dark room for 24 hours for the elimination of
photoreactivation effect of UV effect fixation.  Killing effectiveness
of UV rays was very high; about half of the treated seedlings died at
10 min treatment and almost all died out at 100 min treatment as shown
in the table below<p>

Moreover, retardation of growth was also marked, about half of the
seedlings having still only cotyledons without any further development
two weeks after the treatment in the 1 min lot.  Such seedlings are
expected to die out soon.  The photoreactivation effect will be
examined in the next experiment, but I do not know whether the severe
killing effect coincides or not with the induction of gene mutations,
because the stem of young seedlings is very soft and transparent and
it seems that UV rays act on the stem rather than on the growing
point.<p>
