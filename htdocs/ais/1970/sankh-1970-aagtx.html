<h2> Effect of germanium and gibberellin on the development of Arabidopsis plants</h2><p>

A discussion of the role of mineral nutrition in the maintenance of
the physical organization and activities of living cells, as well as
in the regulation of metabolic patterns has recently acquired ample
attention (EVANS and SORGER, 1966; BOLLARD and BUTLER, 1966; HEWITT,
1963).  In these studies ARNON's (1950) concept of the 'essentiality
of nutrients' has been recognized as too rigid and instead a concept
of 'functional nutrients' has been proposed.  According to NICHOLAS
(1961) the term 'functional or metabolism nutrient' includes any
mineral element that might function in some precise way in plant
metabolism, irrespective of whether or not its action is completely
specific or indispensable. Germaniumn (Ge) is the next higher analogue
of silicon in the main subgroup of Group IV of the Periodic table of
elements.  In diatoms and certain plants germanium acts as a
competitive inhibitor of silicon (LEWIN, 1966; WERNER, 1966, 1967a).
The latter author demonstrated that growth of Sinapsis, Lemna,
Wolffia, Nicotiana, Tradescantia, Zinnia and Secale was depressed by
germanium and that the inhibition could be reversed by silicon
addition. Sankhla and Sankhla (1967) observed that in several plants
treatment with germanium greatly inhibited germination, retarded the
elongation of the hypocotyl, checked the growth of the main root,
inhibited the formation of the laterals and affected the pigmentation
of the cotyledons.  Preliminary studies indicated that in Arabidopsis,
on the other hand, this element did not affect germination and early
seedling growth. Therefore, additional experiments were planned to
study the effect of germanium on the development of Arabidopsis; the
results are being succinctly summarized hereunder.<p>

Plants of Arabidopsis were raised from seeds in pots at
20*degrees*-25*degrees*C under a light bank consisting of white and
coloured cool fluorescent lamps which, at the level of the plants,
supplied a light intensity of about 8.000-10.000 lux.  The treated
plants were sprayed with appropriate concentrations of germanium
solution and data were regularly recorded. The results presented in
the table clearly indicate that although this chemical failed to
influence seed germination, it did affect the subsequent development.
With an increase in concentration a progressive decrease in extension
growth (Figure), fresh weight, and dry weight could be clearly
observed (Table).  Treatment with germanium also delayed flowering,
reduced the number of fruits, and affected their size adversely.
Since gibberellin is now universally recognized as a hormone which
affects the elongation, growth expriments were also planned to study
the effect of germanium and gibberellin in combination.  It was
extremely interesting to observe that gibberellin successfully
reversed the inhibition of elongation growth caused by germanium, and
the treated plants appeared very similar to those reared in
gibberellin alone.<p>

Earlier it was shown that germanium specifically and retrogressively
inhibited growth of Cyclotella, but not that of Chlorella and
Anacystis (WERNER, 1966).  In Sinapsis it did not affect early growth
but inhibited the subsequent growth. Therefore it is assumed that
apparently in certain plants silicon is not an essential growth factor
in early developmental stages, whereas in later development the same
plants need silicon (LEWIS and REIMANN, 1969).<p>

It is worthwile to note that germanium did not inhibit uptake of
silicic acid, but interfered with further reactions of silicic acid
within the cell.  In the treated plants both chlorophyll synthesis and
protein synthesis were drastically inhibited.  However, germanium did
not directly influence respiration, photosynthetic oxygen evolution,
and synthesis of carbohydrates, although it prevented the breakdown of
carbohydrages in the dark (LEWIN, 1966; WERNER, 1967b).  The reversal
of germanium induced inhibition of growth by gibberellin in the
present investigation clearly indicates interesting involvement of
gibberellins in the regulation of some specific reactions which are
possibly antagonized by germanium.<p>
