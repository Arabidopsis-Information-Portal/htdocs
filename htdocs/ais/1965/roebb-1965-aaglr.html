Vol 01S: <h2>Plastom Mutations</h2><p>

G. Robbelen<p>

After RENNER (1934) the sum of the autonomous genetic elements within
the plastid is termed "plastom". The molecular basis of the
intraplastidical information is not yet well known today. Recently
GIBOR and GRANICK (1964) in the journal Science have completely
summarized all the data speaking in favour of an existence of DNA as
the hereditary basis in plastids. There can be no doubt on the
presence of RNA in plastids, and even ribosomes and inherent protein-
(enzyme)- synthesis have lately been demonstrated in isolated
chloroplasts. Thus it might be supposed, that the molecular
constitution of the plastom is fairly similar to that of the genome.
One should, however, keep in mind, that the DNA-RNA- ribosome-pathway
of protein-synthesis is the only hereditary system up to now, which is
sufficiently known in molecualr terms.<p>

In case the similarity in molecular structure of genome and plastom
would appear, the question arises as to how the drastic differences in
mutability of both systems must be explained. In this connection MENKE
(1960) raised the points, that 1) gene mutations are reversible by
back-mutations, but plastom mutations are irreversible and 2) the rate
of gene mutations can be increased by ionizing irradiation or
treatment with mutagenic chemicals, while plastom mutations could not
be induced in adequate experiments. On the other side nuclear genes
are well known in many plant species, which greatly increase the
frequency of plastom mutations.<p>

Basing on this different mutational behaviour of plastids MENKE
constructed a model of the process of a plastom mutation. With
reference to the gene-induced platom mutation he assumed that the
hereditary structures within the plastids need for their reproduction
"in addition to enzyme and substrate small amounts of the reaction
product as a primer. The formation of the enzyme, however, is gene
dependent. A mutation of the gene necessary for enzyme formation leads
to a reversible blocking of enzyme snynthesis and therefore to a lack
of the reaction product. Through division daughter platids arise that
... do not contain the primer". This means an irreversible plastom
mutation, because the plastid cannot synthesize the reaction product,
the specific constituent of the plastom, even when the nucleus of the
cell is restored by crossing with a nonmutated genome. According to
this view plastom mutation is different from gene mutation in that it
consists exclusively in a total deletion of a genetic compound. After
MENKE this is the reason why "the susceptibility of plastids to
mutagens is quite different from that of genomes". - The earlier
literature already contains some data, which do not speak in favour of
this model.  Unfortunately the time left suffices only for throwing
open to discussion some of the own results obtained in experiments
with Arabidopsis.<p>

You surely have read in Arabidopsis Information Service No. 1
(ROBBELEN, 1964) that I got a recessive monohybrid gene-mutation,
which induces plastom mutations in Arabidopsis. The evidence that this
variegation results from plastom mutations has been given 1) by
showing its strictly maternal inheritance, 2) by substituting the
inducing gene by the normal allel without loss of variegation and 3)
by demonstrating microscopically so-called "mixed cells" with normal
and mutated plastids side by side as well as a pattern of variegation
strictly correlated to the margin of a cell descendance within a leaf,
predictable according to the specific rate of sorting out of both
plastid types from mixed cells.  - Meanwhile within this mutant am I
picked up three rare cases of entirely white cell descendances with
small isolated green spots, which represent a definite proof for back
mutation within a plastom-mutant.  For I found these spots consisting
of entirely green as well as mixed cells totally surrounded by white
cells only. MICHAELIS (1957) described a similar case in Epilobium,
but did not establish any mixed cell in the back mutation spot, though
mixed cells occurred frequently in this initial mutant. While
interaction or dominance must be supposed in Epilobium, the case of
back mutation in Arabidopsis seems to be simple and unequivocal.<p>

The second supposition for the validity of the model of MENKE was the
stability of the plastom against mutagenic treatments. Some years ago
I (ROBBELEN 1962) have published certain proof, that extrachromosomal
mutations can be induced in Arabidopsis nearly up to 100 times the
spontaneous rate by X-irradiation of presoaked seeds, zygotes and egg
cells resp. An extensive analysis of these mutants, however, was
impeded by their low absolute frequency of maximum 2.5 per mille.
Since 1961 I have therefore set up similar experiments with highly
mutagenic alkylating chemicals, such as ethyl methanesulphonate (EMS)
and diethylsulfate (ROBBELEN 1963 a, b). Some of these data from
different experiments are shown in Table 1.<p>

Table 1: Leaf colour variations at M1-plants after seed treatment with
alkylating agents.<p>

The results were somewhat dependent on some extrnal factors or
treatment (pH, temperature, concentration of mutagen etc.) as well as
contitioning after treatment (light intensity, photoperiod,
temperature etc.). But these 20% variegated plants are not the maximum
(59%) but an average of 4 experiments in 3 years. Before testing,
however, whether these chloroplast defects really are induced by
extrachromosomal mutations, just as has been the case in the X-ray
induced variants, most of the sectors were lost in the somatic tissue,
and only a few mixed cells could be detected. In the experiment of
1963 for example only 12 of 96 variegated plants could be proved to
have mixed cells, and only 21 of the sectors reached the
inflorescence, with 11 giving extrachromosomal segregation pattern. By
pollinating with pollen from mutated sectors it appeared that one of
the latter 11 variegations was gene-induced, while the other 10 were
independent from nuclear control.  This relatively equals round about
2% gene independent plastom mutations, and therewith moves just in the
same order of magnitude as that received after X-irradiation.<p>

According to our hypothesis the rapid elimination of the mutated
plastids in most of the cell descendences was due to a severe
competition of the normal green chloroplasts, the latter having a
higher multiplication rate. In order to reduce this competition effect
some genic chlorophyll mutants were treated in the same way with ethyl
methanesulfonate (Table 2).<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol01S/vol01S-pg102-tab2.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

Table 2: Somatic mutation test after seed treatment with (1%; 2hr)
ethyl methanesulphonate (% of total M1-plants)<p>

In several of these lines the number and size of chlorophyll deficient
spots obtained was not significantly influenced by a viridis factor
for example. Simultaneously, of course, green areas appeared in the so
treated mutants, indicating a backmutation or something else at the
locus in question. The chlorina mutation (V81 = ch3) was not only of
maximum interest because of its high backmutation rate in the somatic
mutation test, but also regarding its relatively high frequency of
white spots. Moreover the estimates of variegation that NOACK (1921)
defined as the portion of variegated areas of a plant in per cent of
its total leaf surface, these "Scheckungswerte" were remarkably high
in this mutant.<p>

This is indicative for a weaker competition ability of the chlorina
plastids in comparison to the mutated white ones. And indeed in 34
cases out of 61, that is to say in about 50% of the variegated
rosettes that were investigated, mixed cells could be found. Likewise
in comparison with the normal material more than the double number of
spots reached the inflorescence region in the chlorina mutant, thus
enabling us to analyse these cases of albomaculatio in a progeny test.<p>

Table 3: Estimates of the variegation (after NOACK, 1924) at flowering
after seed treatment with (1%; 8hr) ethyl methanesulphonate<p>

Summarizing we may state, 1) that backmutations may occur in the
plastom as well as in the genome, 2) that plastom mutations can be
induced by similar techniques as gene mutations, but 3) that the
efficiency of the mutagens is highly reduced by selective processes,
which eliminate the particular mutated platids from the many normals
in the course of their random distribution at every cell division. It
is not the different molecular process, which prevents from the
frequent apperance of plastom mutations, but the different composition
of the plastom, which consists not only of two, but of many homologous
units segregating intra-individually with every cell division.<p>

Discussion:<p>

REINHOLZ: Have you any idea about the genetic substance within the
plastids? What about DNA? Is this hypothesis true?<p>

ROBBELEN: I pointed towards the summary of GIBOR and GRANICK.  It
composes all the data which speak in favour of DNA in chloroplasts.  I
think their scheme on the genetic constitution of the plastid gives a
fairly good working hypothesis.<p>

KRANZ: Does anyone know where the inheritable substance might be
located in plastids?<p>

ROBBELEN: There is no indication. The amount of DNA in chloroplasts is
relatively small. It is difficult to estimate it exactly because of
the impurities from the nucleus. But after one had found, that DNA of
chloroplasts contains different base composition, one could establish
a method of make assurance about DNA in chloroplasts. This satellite
DNA could be increased by isolation of chloroplasts before DNA
evaluation.<p>

REDEI: How many green chloroplasts have to be present in one cell to
see it green?<p>

ROBBELEN: That should be different for different layers of the leaf.
Even if you only watch palisade cells it is difficult to count as this
can only be done with sections. The technic of MICHAELIS in Epilobium
to put the whole leaf under a microscope did not work in Arabidopsis
successully.<p>

REDEI: How many of those induced variegations could be proved to be
extrachromosomal by maternal inheritance? Of this fairly high number,
which you indicated, were they all maternally inherited? Were you able
to make crosses and transfer only through the female?<p>

ROBBELEN: That was just what I did. I got 20% variegations and only
one of 100 were maternally inherited. That is in total not more than
20%, but nevertheless 100 times more than normal. I would, however,
put more stress on the fact of competition. I should like to find
plastids which are less compatible to the mutated ones, to obtain an
excess of mutated sectors.<p>

REDEI: Are the plastids to any extent transferred through the pollen
in Arabidopsis?<p>

ROBBELEN: I think there is no transmission, because these gene-
induced plastom mutants should have shown some variegation in the
reciprocal cross in F1 too, but up to now they did never.<p>

REDEI: If one could transfer plastids through the male, one may get
recombinations between plastids.<p>

ROBBELEN: I would doubt about this, because in Arabidopsis there
exists a strong mechanism which selects against mixed cells.  This
strong mixing out of cells, probably enabled me to get a lot of white
sectors and of forms, which I could judge as mutations. But on the
other hand this inhibits genetic analysis, as this low frequency of
mixed cells prevents from transmission to progeny. This would also
prevent male transmission. There is no doubt that in any flowering
plant plastids of the generative cell are penetrating into the egg
cytoplasm. The question is only, whether they can be multiplied in the
egg cell (cf. STEFFEN and LANDMANN: Planta 51, 30, 1958).<p>

REDEI: Do these white sectors give any seeds?<p>

ROBBELEN: That depends on the amount of green areas in the rosette of
the plant.<p>

REDEI: I think, if you could get all-white tissue in one
inflorescence, there would be no competition and selection would
favour recombinants.<p>

BROWN: Has it been possible to propagate seeds from these white
siliques?<p>

ROBBELEN: We have not yet extensively tried. This should need sterile
culture, which is just in preparation.<p>

BROWN: I have found similar phenotypes in a progeny from plants
treated with mutagens (EMS and gamma-irradiation). I sowed seeds in
sterile culture. The white sectored plants did not respond to a
supplement of concentrated aqueous extract from Arabidopsis rosettes.<p>

REINHOLZ: Did you investigate the ultrastructure of these
chloroplasts.<p>

ROBBELEN: Yes. My later lecture will show this.<p>

KRANZ: What is the number of chloroplasts in the green cell of
Arabidopsis?<p>

ROBBELEN: About 30. This is much more than you would expect from the
rate of random sorting out of plastids in mixed cells, to give white
sectors in one plant at all in the same generation of mutation
induction. If you suppose that the development of one leaf takes about
15 cycles this would not be enough to get a white spot with a random
mechanism. But we got them, and this is indicative for a directed
sorting out.<p>

KRANZ: Are there differences in the number of chloroplasts between
palisade cells and other cell layers in the leaf?<p>

ROBBELEN: Yes, there are, and it is necessary to perform all these
analyses in a defined layer of the leaf.<p>
