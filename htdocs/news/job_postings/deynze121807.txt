Bioinformatics Postdoctoral Researcher for Marker Discovery 
and Massively Parallel Genotyping 
Job Description. The University of California, Davis, CA USA, 
Seed Biotechnology Center (http://sbc.ucdavis.edu) and Genome 
and Biomedical Sciences Facility has developed a custom 6.6 
million feature Affymetrix GeneChip for robust, massively-parallel 
genotyping based on Single Feature Polymorphisms (SFPs) as well 
as for gene expression analysis in pepper. The successful candidate 
will be responsible for developing and applying custom tools to 
analyze genotyping and mapping Affymetrix GeneChip data from 
pepper. Scripts are required to curate and process raw GeneChip 
hybridization data (1 TB of data) into a relational mySQL database 
for further analysis. Methods for identification and validation SFPs 
will need to be developed as well as for measurement of gene 
expression tools using the highly redundant probe sets provided by 
the chip. Many of these algorithms can be adapted from a similar 
project in lettuce with the same unique chip design. 
Qualifications. Ph.D. in biology- or bioinformatics-related 
discipline. Candidate must have demonstrated experience in 
computational approaches to manipulate and analyze large genetic 
and molecular datasets. Experience with at least one scripting 
language such as Perl, PHP, Python, R or equivalent is required.  
Basic knowledge of relational mySQL database is desirable. 
Previous experience with Affymetrix GeneChip data is an 
advantage.
