ABSTRACT<p>

In continuation of earlier performed experiments and their published
results (Bork, U. and A.R. Kranz, 1987; Bork, U. et al., 1986; Bork,
U. et al., 1987) we irradiated dry seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana with
particles of high energy and charge (HZE particles) at the heavy ion
accelerator UNILAC of GSI, Darmstadt, West Germany. During cultivation
of the irradiated samples we observed several aberrations in varied
developmental endpoints such as survival rate, frequency of normal
plants wihout tumors, embryo vitality and others.<p>

INTRODUCTION<p>

The aim of our experiments is to elucidate the biophysical and genetic
mechanism of radiation-damage induced by heavy ions. Furthrmore we are
collecting hereby reference data for the evaluation of
Biostack-experiments performed in space investigating the biological
effects of cosmic radiation (Kranz, 1986). The main reasons for
choosing Arabidopsis thaliana were easy handling, tiny seeds, relative
radiation insensitivity (Sparrrow and Evans, 1961) due to small size
and number of chromosomes. Additionally we consider the small
geometrical size of the biological targets, i.e., apical meristem
cells and cell-nuclei called genetic effective cells (GEC), as
advantageous for the proper correlation between biological effects and
single HZE-particle events.<p>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<p>

Dry seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana wild type En-2 were fixed on
cellulosenitrate detector sheets using the adhesive Luviskol VA 64,
10% in 50% aqueous ethanol solution (g/v). These foils were fixed in
petri-dishes (*phi* 35mm) and then exposed to heavy ion radiation in a
chamber adapted to the Unilac machine (Kraft, 1980). After
irradiation, the plants (M1) were cultivated on Redei's aseptic medium
(Koller-Lampert and Kranz, 1983). Growth continued after transferring
vital plantlets to sterilized standard soil (loam/compost/peat/sand
6:3:2:1 v/v/v) i a temperature and light controlled greenhouse
(25+/-4*degrees*C, long day illumination larger than 3klx). Survival
rates were determined by the number of plants in M 1-generation which
yielded seeds. Embryo lethality inside the siliques, a later genetic
effect of radiation in M 2, was detrmined by calculation of the ratio
of defective to normal embryogenesis inside the fruits of M 1 plants.
For this, the method of Muller (1963) was simplified and adapted to
the high rate of aberrations induced by the heavy ions as follows: The
third and fourth pod of the main stem was utilized from 50 plants per
treatment; furthermore only nondeveloped, shrunken brownish (sicca,
brevis, vana), and white yellowish (albina, xantha) seeds were
determined by opening the union line of the carpel margin under 10-20
fold magnification. The determination of the mutation frequency of M
1-plants rsp. the frequency of normal plants without tumors was made
on agarized Redei's media (s.l.) after three weeks of growth. Tumors
were classified under 10 to 25 fold magnification. Data processing was
achieved by the use of a Victor/Sirius VI personal computer using self
developed programs.<p>

RESULTS<p>

Figure 1 shows the dependence of the frequency of normal plants
without tumors in M 1 on the particle flux density of Ca 15 MeV/u. The
decrease is almost exponential above flux densities of 1.5x10 8
particles/cm 2, which is equivalent to about 15 hits per cell nucleus.
The calculated value for the cross section for the induction of tumors
is about 0.2 micro m 2. This value is in the range of previously
calculated cross sections for lethality (Bork, U. and Kranz, A.R.,
1987) induced by ions of Argon.<p>

Figure 2 illustrates the dependence of the embryo vitality of the
surviving plants on the particle flux density and charge of the heavy
ions. The embryo vitalities observed in the Ne-and Xe-exposures show a
distinct threshold value at the flux density of 50x10 6 particles/cm
2. The embryo vitality decreases with increasing flux density and
charge of the heavy ions. Since the charge of Xe (+54) is three times
the charge of Ar (+18) it was expected the Xe-results to be below the
Ar-results. This unexpected position of the Xe-curve yet is not fully
understood and may be explained by the fact, that during morphogenesis
the cell elements are more damaged by the higher charged particles and
by this higher LET: they could be, therefore, more frequently
eliminated.<p>

Figure 3 demonstrates the dependence of the embryo vitality on the
particle flux density and energy of the heavy ions and on soaking the
seeds before irradiation. The difference between the results of Ar 19
MeV/u compared to Ar 14.7 MeV/u is very small but, evidently, the
decrease of embryo vitality with increasing particle flux density of
Ar 19 MeV/u is steeper. The results of the experiment performed with
soaked seeds resp. embryos show, that hydrated and thus metabolizing
embryos are more sensitive for HZE-particles than dry seeds of the
dormant state. Similar effects were observed by Fujii (1967) for
irradiation with thermal neutrons and *gamma*-rays. Earlier
experiments done by Reinholz (1947) with *alpha*-rays showed these
effects, too.<p>

Additionally, in the presence of water the densely ionizing radiation
can produce highly reactive OH-radicals, yielding molecular
aberrations of DNA. After irradiation the molecular and cellular
damages may be repaired or damaged cells may be replaced by others.
The results indicate the evidence of mechanisms of restitution and
substitution, which are until now not investigated in detail. More
data on the dependence of biological parameters on charge, energy and
particle flux density of the heavy ions can be determined unequivocal
only by performing more experiments at heavy ion accelerators
producing particles of increased kinetic energy (>1GEV/u), for
instance the Heavy Ion Synchrotron/Experimental Storage Ring (SIS/ESR)
which is presently built by GSI, Darmstadt.<p>
