The establishment of the collection centres for seed storage of
Arabidopsis mutants involves a number of both scientific and
organization problems.  It is worth to carry out storage and
enrichment of the analogous collection material of species,
populations, and mutant forms of the genus Arabidopsis at the
institutes and laboratories actively working on this plant in
different continents. The seed banks might be, for instance, organized
in America, in Europe, and in the Soviet Union.  it is quite evident
now that duplicating the same material at the collection centres in
different countries entails certain difficulties requiring additional
finances for special buildings with modern equipment, scientific and
technical staff. When all those problems will be overcome, we'll have
safe guarantees of reserving the gene resources of Arabidopsis under
those unforeseen circumstances when the whole collection or a part of
it can unfortunately be destroyed at one of the storage places.<p>

There are some questions to be solved while organizing the seed bank
of Arabidopsis mutants.  Firstly, the effects of the prolonged storage
of seeds on the biological characteristics of their germination.
Secondly, effective control over the state of seeds in the time course
of their storage and revival. Thirdly, working out the universal
nomenclature of the mutant plants:<p>

1.  While studying the anatomical-morpholigical peculiarities one
notes relatively small size and contents of endosperm in the seeds of
Arabidopsis.  This strongly restricts long storage of seeds under
natural conditions.  It has been shown that germination of seeds after
5 years storage at t*degrees* 16-18*degrees*C for the race Enkheim
(En-2) decreases from 87 to 19% (ROBBELEN, 1965).  Our data partially
represented in Figure 1, indicate that seeds lose completely any
ability to germinate after 9 years of storage at room temperature.
Lack of the ability to germinate is accompanied by several
physiological changes: the retarded growth of the primary roots (Fig.
1) and the plants, the decrease of fertility.  This regularity is also
confirmed while germinating the seeds from plants grown in the tube
culture.<p>

However, in this case the complete inability to germinate is observed
after 6 years storage.  It has been also noted that seeds of a number
of chlorophyll mutants grown in the tubes lose their capacity to
germinate after 1-2 years storage. The vain efforts to reanimate the
seeds under different conditions (additions to the media of sugars,
vitamins, aminoacids, hormone preparations, yeast extract etc.)
probably indicate the universal processes in the embryo during the
storage period.  All this make the problem of working out methods of
control or conservation in order to elininate the loss of the unique
lines of the collection material.<p>

Figure 1: The effects of long storage on the length of the primary
roots and the percent of germination of seeds, race Enkheim (En-2).
The seeds were obtained from plant grown in the soil. Conditions of
the experiment: germination of seeds and measuring of rootlets were
carried out on the 7th day in agar at t*degrees* 18-20*degrees*C and
light regime 20 hours light and 4 hours in the dark.<p>

 2.  Using the computer we have found the way of control over the
state of seed collections. Seed collection is taken as a dynamic
system consisting of N lines. There are also two characteristics:
*alpha* (t)-counted from the moment t maximal duration of storage of
seeds from one line, after the expiry of which the percent of survival
of plants the regenerated line become slower than the level fixed
before P%; *beta* -interval between the moment of sowing up to
maturation of the new generation.  The worked out algorythm about the
state of seed collections at a certain moment indicates the critical
time period t + *tau* when in the collection at least for one of the
lines *alpha* (t + *tau*) = 0; it also defines that state of collection
and reveals the lines requiring regeneration. This algorythm has been
realized on the algorythm and tested on the collections of A. thaliana
seeds.<p>

3.  The creation of a simple system for the phenetic classification of
mutant plants is another important problem in organizing collection
centres. The scientific value of such universal system is quite
evident; besides that, it might serve as a safe basis for finding the
rational ways of coding the collection material that might have great
practical use. Critical analysis of works devoted to general
classification of plants showed to universal system compiling all
known inherited-altered features. Classification system of mtuatns
offered by some authors are as usual too specific, and as a rule, they
are imperfect, too bulky, and insufficient for practical use.<p>

Working on collections of Arabidopsis mutants we are testing now n
universal system of phenetic classification of mutants (Figure 2)).
Groups of mutations, enlisted there, are characterized by life cycles
(A), relative viability (B), behaviour of mutations in ontogenesis in
different environmental conditions (C), and phenotypes of mutations
(D).<p>

Figure 2: Phenetic classification of mutations. The scheme represents
the following groups: A-life cycles, B-relative viability, C-the way
of the mutation action in ontogenesis in different environmental
conditions, D-the rate of knowledge about phenotypic behavoiur of
mutaions. Squares designate the classes marked by the author, circles
- the subclasses of mutations.<p>

This system significantly simplifies the coding of the collection
material; this is very important for the effective control over the
state of seed collections by means of computers.  In conclusion it is
worth noting that our system of phenetic classification of mutations
is far from being complete; it is shown in the scheme, many mutation
groups are not considered.  However, we hope this system may be
interesting for discussions on the classification of plant mutants.<p>
