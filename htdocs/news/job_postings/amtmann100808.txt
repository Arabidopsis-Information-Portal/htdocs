Post-doc position, University of Glasgow, Scotland, UK 
 
Epigenetics and Abiotic Stress Tolerance 
 
Ref No: 14508/DPO/A3 
Salary: £24,403 - £33,780 per annum 
Closing date: 8th October 2008 
 
A 3-year post-doc position is available in the laboratory of Anna Amtmann to 
study the Role of Epigenetics in Plant Stress Memory. The project involves 
genome-wide profiling of DNA-methylation and histone-modification status, 
identification of target genes and their functional characterisation. 
The RA will collaborate with the Plant Epigentics & Epigenomics Group of 
Vincent Colot (ENS, Paris) and the Solexa/Illumina high-throughput sequencing 
facility at FBLS, and oversee a PhD student on the same project. Candidates 
should have a proven track record in plant molecular biology (preferably 
experience with ChIP and MeDIP) and a strong background in (epi)genetics 
and/or plant abiotic stress tolerance.
