INTRODUCTION<p>

In a previous paper (Cattoir-Reynaerts et al., 1981) the isolation of
mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana (wild type Bensheim) resistant to
analogues of aspartate derived amino acids and to inhibitory
concentrations of lysine plus threonine, or of lysine alone, was
described. On the basis of their free amino acid composition, their
degree of resistance, and the production of seeds, some mutants were
considered for further biochemical and genetical characterization.
Three different categories of resistant mutants were distinguished:<p>

1. mutants with a free amino acid composition comparable to the
composition of the wild type.<p>

2. mutants characterized by an increased threonine content (2-7 times
more than the wild type) in the free amino acid pool.<p>

3. mutants with a slightly increased (2-3 times) free lysine content.<p>

The resistance of the mutant 5 FALT 26 (selected on inhibitory
concentrations of lysine plus threonine) was determined to be due to a
less efficient uptake of lysine and other basic amino acids (Van
Ghelue et al., 1982). A double recessive mutation appeared to be
responsible for the altered uptake mechanism.<p>

In the present paper we describe the properties of the mutant 5 FL 32,
selected on inhibitory concentrations of lysine. Preliminary data
concerning the threonine overproducer 5 FALT 40/6/1, a mutant
resistant to lysine plus threonine, are also mentioned.<p>

MATERIAL AND METHODS<p>

Resistance tests<p>

Seeds of the wild type line Be-O (Bensheim) were sterilized as
previously reported (Van Ghelue et al., 1982) and then sown on solid
(o.6% agar) mineral medium of Feenstra (1964) with 2% glucose added.
Inhibitors (amino acids and analogues) were filter sterilized and
added to the autoclaved basal medium. After sowing, petri-dishes were
preincubated at 4*degrees*C for at least 48 hours. Afterwards they
were incubated at 23-24*degrees*C, 16 hours light, and 8 hours
darkness.<p>

Amino acid analysis<p>

Eight day old plantlets grown on Feenstra medium (Feenstra, 1964)
without any amino acids or analogues, were extracted three times with
a mixture of methanol/chloroform/water (12/5/1) (Bieleski and Turner,
1966). Chlorophyll was removed by the addition of chloroform and
water, in this order. The aqueous layer was evaporated and the residue
was resolved in 2N HC1. The extracts were hydrolysed at 100*degrees*C
under vacuum. After evaporation of the acid, the residue was dissolved
in load buffer (0.2M natrium-citrate pH 2.2). The extracts were
filtrated and analysed in a LKB Biochrom 4101 amino acid analyser on
DC 6A resin, using a four buffer program.<p>

Enzyme assays<p>

A complete description of enzyme extraction and determination of
aspartate kinase (E.C. 1.7.1.4.)- and homoserine dehydrogenase (E.C.
1.1.1.3.)-activity, was described by Cattoir Reynaerts et al., 1983).
Dihydrodipicolinate synthase (E.C., 4.2.1.52)-activity was assayed
using the O-ABA (o-aminobenzaldehyd)-method of Yugari and Gilvarg
(1965) as described by Negrutiu et al. (1984). Protein concentration
was determined by the method of Bradford (1976).<p>

Uptake of labelled amino acids<p>

Two hours before starting the uptake experiment, eight day old
plantlets, grown on mineral medium of Feenstra (1964), with 2%
glucose, were incubated in liquid Feenstra-medium. Then they were
transferred to liquid Feenstra-medium containing 1 mM amino acid, for
defined period of time. This medium contained 14 C-labeled amino acids
at a concentration of 1 micro Ci per 2.5 micro mole amino acid. After
incubation, the plantlets were washed three times with Feenstra
medium, containing the corresponding unlabeled amino acid but at a
concentration of 5 mM. The plantlets were destained in 0.5 ml H 2 0
2/propanol (1/1; v/v). Afterwards they were macerated for another 12
hours in 1 ml Lumasolve (Lumac), and radioactivity was measured using
Lipoluma (Lumac) as scintillation cocktail.<p>

Genetical analysis<p>

Mutants were crossed to wild type Arabidopsis, and the resistance
trait was followed in F 1 and F 2 progenies. To identify the F
1-hybrids, the mtuants were crossed to the wild type line Wa-1
(Warschau) which showed a glutamate dehydrogenase and acid phosphatase
isozyme pattern different from the line Be-O.<p>

RESULTS<p>

5 FL 32<p>

The mutant 5 FL 32 was isolated as homogenously resistant, on medium
containing 2 mM lysine (FL medium). Analysis of the free amino acid
pool showed that this mutant contained about three times more
threonine than the original line Be-O.<p>

A test for cross resistance to different analogues of aspartate
derived amino acids, and to analogues of amino acids belonging to
other biosynthetic families, showed that the mutant 5 FL 32 was not
only resistant to lysine, but also survived growth inhibitory
concentations of aminoethyl-cysteine (AEC) and of lysine plus
threonine (Table 1).<p>

Table 1: Cross resistance of mutant 5 FL 32 and descendants of 5 FALT
40/6/1, to different amino acids analogues (relative estimation of the
growth of seedlings, 8 days after sowing).<p>

The mutant was slightly more resistant to the threonine analogue
hydroxynorvaline and to the arginine analogue canavanine. 5 FL 32
showed no resistance to ethionine, a methionine analogue.<p>

The observations lead to the conclusion that 5 FL 32 could also have
been selected on a medium containing inhibitory concentrations of
lysine plus threonine or of AEC. Overproduction of end products is
often related to a modification in regulatory properties of the main
key enzymes (Miflin et al., 1983) of the concerned pathway.<p>

In an attempt to explain the increased threonine pool in 5 FL 32 we
determined the activity and inhibition by lysine and/or threonine of
the three crucial enzymes in the aspartate metabolism: aspartate
kinase (AK), homoserine dehydrogenase (HDH and dihydrodipicolinate
synthase (DHPS).<p>

Wild type and mutant enzyme activity, and inhibition by its substrates
were compared and are reported in Table 2.<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol22/vol22-pg17-tab2.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

Table 2: Relative activity (the activity without inhibitor is 100) of
AK, HDH and DHPS, in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of
lysine and threonine, determined in extacts of 21 days old plantlets
of wild type, mutant 5 FL 32 and 5 FALT 40/6/1.<p>

The characteristics of AK and HDH of 5 FL 32, are fully comparable
with the characteristics of the enzymes of the wild type. However, the
DHPS of 5 FL 32 appeared to be slightly more sensitive to lysine
inhibition than the wild type enzyme (with 50 microM lysine, about 80%
of the activity of DHPS of the wild type could be inhibited, while the
inhibition for the same amount of lysine was 95% in the mutant).<p>

As the cross resistance test showed a general resistance to basic
amino acids and their analogues, we compared the uptake of labeled
lysine, threonine and leucine (an amino acid belonging to another
family) in the wild type and the mutant line (Figure 1).<p>

The uptake of leucine and threonine of the mutant was comparable with
the uptake observed in the wild type. However, mutant 5 FL 32 showed a
lower rate of lysine uptake than the wild type. This could explain the
resistance of 5 FL 2 to lysine. The analysis of F1 and F2 progenies
obtained from a cross between the mutant and the wild type Wa-O,
showed that the resistance of 5 FL 32 was inherited as a single
recessive trait.<p>

5 FALT 40/6/1<p>

This mutant was selected as homogenously resistant one to lysine plus
threonine. However, this mutant segregated also out for a secondary
chorophyll mutation which caused the lethality of a fraction of the
progeny. 5 FALT 40/6/1 is characterized by an increase of free
threonine (about twelve times as high as the wild type free threonine
content). The mutant is specifically resistant to lysine plus
threonine and shows no cross resistance to AEC or lysine, or any other
analogues (see table 1).<p>

Figure 1: Uptake of labeled amino acids (1 micro Ci/2/5 micro mole) in
wild type Bensheim and mutant 5 FL 32.<p>

The analyses of the activity and feedback regulatory properties of the
three main enzymes of the aspartate pathway, showed that HDH and DHPS
did not differ significantly in the mutant compared to the wild type.
On the other hand, the inhibition pattern of AK lysine and threonine
was clearly different (see Table 2). The wild type enzyme is
inhhibited for 70% by a concentration of 10 mM lysine, and the mutant
enzyme for less than 30%. The enzyme is also less sensitive to the
inhhbition by threonine than the wild type enzyme. The inhibition of
both lysine and threonine together was reduced from 80% in the wild
type to 35% in the mutant.<p>

Further analyses on partially purfied enzymes are presently performed
to confirm the modified behaviour of the mutant enzyme.<p>

DISCUSSION<p>

Resistance of mutant 5 FL 32, selected on toxic concentrations of
lysine, is due to a less efficient uptake of lysine. The resistance of
the inhibitory combination lysine plus threonine, to
aminoethylcysteine and to canavanine, could also be explained by a
modified uptake system. Further uptake studies will have to confirm
this. Genetic analysis showed that single recessive mutation is
responsible for this probably altered uptake system for basic amino
acids.<p>

A possible interpretation of the increased threonine content in the
free amino acid pool, could be related to the altered DHPS
characteristics. Because this enzyme is now more inhibited by lysine,
the reaction will only continue as long as lysine is strictly needed
and more aspartylsemialdehyde will be available to be converted to
threonine. This hypothesis is now tested by combining enzyme assays
and amino acid analyses.<p>

The mutant 5 FALT 40/6/1, is examined more closely to confirm the
change of the regulatory properties of aspartase kinase. Mutants like
5 FALT 40/6/1, characterized by a mutated gene coding for aspartate
kinase insensitive to feedback inhibition, can be used to clone the
modified gene and to use it in transformation experiments, taking
advantage of the resistance of transformed cells to inhibitory
concentrations of lysine plus threonine.<p>

The results also point out that Arabidopsis appears as a convenient
organism to obtain various types of mutants, resistant to amino acid
analogues and amino acid combinations. The use of such a model system
can lead to device more efficient selection methods for selecting
amino acid overproducers with a potential agronomoic value.<p>

SUMMARY<p>

The characterization of a mutant, resistant to inhibitory
concentrations of lysine, is presented. The resistance of 5 FL 32 is
due to a less efficient uptake of lysine, which can probably be
explained by a modified uptake system for basic amino acids. A single
recessive mutation is responsible for the resistance.<p>

Another mutant, 5 FALT 40/6/1, selected on inhibitory concentrations
of lysine plus threonine, showed an overproduction of threonine (12
x). There are indications that this is due to an altered
aspartokinase.<p>
