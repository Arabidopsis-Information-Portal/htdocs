FLUOROMETRIC DETERMINATION OF DNA CONTENT

From Hoefer Scientific Instruments, as used by Jo Putterill
(Department of Molecular Genetics, The Cambridge Laboratory, The 
John Innes Centre for Plant Science Research, Colney Lane, 
Norwich, NR4 7UJ, England.)

1.  SOLUTIONS
  (i) TNE BUFFER (x10) l-1
100mM Tris.Cl pH 7.4 12.1 g
10mM EDTA   3.7 g
1M NaCl 58.4 g

  (ii) DYE STOCK SOLUTION
Hoechst 33258 10 mg
water to 10 ml
 *  Store in foil-wrapped tube at 4oC for up to 6 months.

  (iii) DNA  STANDARDS
Calf thymus DNA 10, 100, 250 and 500 ugml-1


2.  PROCEDURE
  (i) Prepare 1 x TNE buffer and then filter to remove any particulate 
matter.
  (ii) Make up a working dye solution by adding the dye stock to 1 x 
TNE to a final concentration of 0.1 ugml-1 (1 ul dye stock/10ml 1 x 
TNE).
  (iii) Set fluorometer to excitation wavelength 365 nm and emission 
wavelength 458 nm.
  (iv) Pipette 2 ml of working dye solution into cuvette and place in the 
fluorometer.  This gives the 'blank' reading.
  (v) Pipette 2 ul of DNA reference standard into 2 ml of 1 x TNE buffer 
and measure fluorescence.  Plot curve of DNA concentration versus 
fluorescence units.
  (vi) Similarly, obtain fluorometer readings of 2 ul of each sample 
DNA.  Determine concentration of DNA in sample from standard 
curve.

 *  This method has been used for yeast and plant DNA preparations 
which are reasonably pure  (e.g., after phenol/chloroform extraction 
and ethanol precipitation, but may contain RNA or protein).

 *  Fragmented DNA gives a poor signal.

 *  Try to use standard DNA of a similar type as the sample DNA.
