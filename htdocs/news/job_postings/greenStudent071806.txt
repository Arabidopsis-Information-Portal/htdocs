[Arabidopsis] Ph.D. Studentships: Functional Genomics of miRNAs and siRNAs


   Ph.D. Studentships: Functional Genomics of miRNAs and siRNAs.–
   Starting Fall 2006 and 2007. Delaware Biotechnology Institute,
   University of Delaware
   
   Two Ph.D. Studentships are open to study the role of miRNAs and siRNAs
   from plants, an area of research focus at the University of Delaware.
   (see Lu et al., Science, 309:1567-1569, 2005; Henderson et al, Nature
   Genetics, 38:721-725,2006; Meyers et al., Current Opinion in
   Biotechnology, 17:139-146, 2006; Souret et al., Mol. Cell, 15:173-183,
   2004).  Possible topics of research include the role of miRNAs and
   specialized siRNAs in abiotic stress responses in Arabidopsis, mRNA
   stability regulated by hormones or the clock in Arabidopsis, and the
   interaction of microbes with Medicago truncatula.  The successful
   candidates will be exposed to small RNA library construction,
   identification of mRNA targets of miRNAs, small RNA microarrays, small
   RNA biosynthesis  mutants, and studies of biological function
   involving reverse genetic analysis of miRNA targets, miRNA
   overexpression, and multi-network modeling.  He/she will develop
   expertise in some or all of these areas depending on the project and
   will be exposed  to  sophisticated computational  analysis. Students
   will  receive  a  competitive graduate stipend,  university-paid
   tuition, and medical insurance benefits.  See
   [1]http://ag.udel.edu/research/ito/index.html for additional details
   about our Ph.D. program. Applications are especially encouraged from
   candidates and who enjoy working both independently and as part of a
   collaborative team. Please contact Pam Green [2]green@dbi.udel.edu for
   the Arabidopsis studentship and Janine Sherrier
   [3]sherrier@dbi.udel.edu for the Legume studentship, and include your
   CV.
   
   The University of Delaware is located in a nice college town along the
   eastern corridor, about an hour from Philadelphia and Baltimore and
   two hours from New York and Washington, DC.  The Delaware
   Biotechnology Institute is a state of the-art-facility built by the
   University about five years ago [4]http://www.dbi.udel.edu/
   
   The University of Delaware is an Equal Opportunity Employer which
   encourages applications from minority group members and women.
