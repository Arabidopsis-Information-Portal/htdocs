As an example of the application of the theoretical model (CETL, 1976)
was the experimental results to the problems of the genetic
variability in the developmental rate in natural populations of
Arabidopsis, an analysis of some populations as to their genetic
structure will be done under certain simplifications.<p>

A fairly numerous group exists among winter-annual populations whose
frequency of generative individuals amounts from few tenths percent to
about 20 percent.  EFFMERTOVA and CETL (1968) assumed that alleles for
late flowering and vernalization requirement are dominant over those
for early flowering and no vernalization requirement. Even if the
number of loci and alleles responsible for these differences remains
unknown (KARLOVSKA, 1974) it can be supposed to be only two alleles on
one locus, L for late, and l for early.  Such a simplification is
admissible also from the viewpoint of population genetics., and some
deductions may be done on this basis.<p>

One of these poulations, HV-3, was found to have genotypic frequencies
in equilibrium or nearly so (EFFMERTOVA and CETL, 1968).  Following
apparently genotypic frequencies were established in a special
experiment:<p>

(P) = .6629, (H) = .2627, (Q) = .0674<p>

It must be kept in mind that these genotypic frequencies were obtained
under artificial growing conditions at 25*degrees*C with continuous
illumination so that no selection against the early homozygote (11)
did take place. As the above genotypic frequencies are valid only in a
nonselective environment they are put into parentheses for the
discrimination from those valid in the selective environment.  On the
natural locality where the population sample HV-3 was collected a
strong selection pressure against early genotypes can be expected
leading to the fact that no early individual will be successful in
survival and reproduction (CETL, DOBROVOLNA and EFFMERTOVE, 1969).
Thus w2 = O, and actual genotypic frequencies on the natural locality
will not be the same compared with the experimental environment. They
will be<p>

P = .7108, H = .2892, Q = O<p>

According to the formula (3, ii) for "asymmetry with lethality" (CETL,
1976) the equilibrium frequency of the heterozygote Ll<p>

The adaptive value of the dominant LL homozygote will be then w1=
.4538.  As w1<1 selection against the dominant homozygote is proved.
In the present case w1<.5, and the eventual equilibrium condition is
connected with balanced polymorphism. The two alleles, L and l, remain
to be present in the population in spite of the elimination of early
recessive ll homozygotes every year.  In the next vegetation period
the ll individuals will appear only in the consequence of segregation
of the Ll heterozygotes, but they will be eliminated again.<p>

In other population samples of this group no special experiments were
done to establish the genotypic frequencies in the nonselective
environment.  Only the (Q) values were known to be expressed as
proportions of generative plants, g.  Under the assumption that
recessive early homozygotes may appear only from segregating
heterozygotes every year the following scheme was constructed (figure
1).  The interrelations of adaptive values, w1, heterozygote
frequency, H, along with the fixation index, F, and gene frequencies,
p and q, are given in the dependence on the potential frequency of the
recessive 11, homozygote in the nonselective environment (Q) in figure
1.<p>

Figure 1: Dependence of the equilibrium genotypic frequency of
heterozygotes, H, the adaptive value, w1, the equilibrium gene
frequencies, p and q, and the equilibrium fixation index, F, on the
frequency of recessive homozygotes in the nonselective environment,
(Q); the estimates of w1 in single population samples along with the
population sample HV-3 are denoted by arrows.<p>

The demonstrated scheme accords well with the situation on the natural
localities. The population samples of this group are bound to the
lowland localities with high temperatures so that the supposed
selection pressure against early genotypes must be really strong. They
represent a closed group among the population samples from the whole
territory studied. This fact is also demonstrated by an expressive
minimum in the distibution of the population samples according to the
proportion of generative plants at about g = 15 percent. The figure 1
shows that this hypothetical mechanism is valid only when (Q) <.2.  At
(Q) = .15 a rapid decrease of w1 values takes place.<p>

Among 40 population samples with less than 20 percent generative
individuals, 12 carried no generative plants, 18 were with .9 to 13.3
percent of generative plants, and only one had 15.3 percent of
generative plants. This fact may be connected with some advantage of
rather higher adaptive values, w1. The HV-3 population sample analyzed
above represents a good example for this group.<p>

The limit (Q) = .2 with its zero adaptive value of the LL genotype
suggests that the common presence of both early and late genotypes in
the population samples with more than 20 percent of generative plants
is based on other mechanisms.<p>

Another important deduction may be done from the fact that in all
population samples of this group the estimated values of w1 are coming
close rather to .5 than to zero. At these high adaptive values the
equilibrium is attained very slowly so that under these circumstances
the corresponding populations would be of long age. This deduction is
in a good agreement with the fact that nearly all populations of this
group were collected on the localities which were scarcely affected by
human influences.<p>

It would be possible to estimate also the values of w1 and H under the
assumption of a certain proportion of random crossing. But such values
would be only slightly modified if 1 or 2 percent of crossing were
taken into account.<p>
