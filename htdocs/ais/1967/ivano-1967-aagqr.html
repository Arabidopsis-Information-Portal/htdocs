	After irradiation of Arabidopsis seeds the formation of additional generative shoots in the normally single shooted plants is frequently observed.  Therefore, an attempt was made to study some peculiarities of such a radiation induced "multicaulity".<p>

	Air-dry seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) HEYNH., race enkheim, were irradiated with various doses of 60Co gamma-rays and planted immediately into test tubes.  The experiments were designed in randomised blocks.  For further technical details see IVANOV and SANINA in this issue. During the generative stage of plant development the numbers of shoots were recorded in survivors. The obtained results are tabulated below:<p>

	The figures indicate a considerable increase in the percentage of multicaulous plants up to 70 kR followed by a plateau at 70 to 110 kR and a decrease at 160kR. At the latter two doses a selective lethality of seedlings capable of additional shoot formation may be suspected, since at doses below 110 kR at least 40% and at 160 kR more than 80% of seedlings did not survive to the generative stage.  The general pattern of this radiation induced multicaulity, namely the increase in percentage of multicaulous plants with increasing dose and the essential non-linearity of the dose-response curve was also confirmed by means of an analysis of variance (P below 0.0005), which revealed that the response under question, unlike some other effects of radiation on plant growth and development, is only moderately variable, both between the randomised blocks (P between 0.7-0.8) and between the independent replicated experiments (P between 0.8-0.9).<p>

	It is noteworthy that the considerable increase in the percentage of multicaulous plants (about 12-fold in the dose range of 10 to 110 kR) was accompanied by a very slight increase, if any, in the number of additional shoots per multicaulous plant (only about 1.2-fold in the same range).  On these grounds it seems likely that the occurrence of a certain number of additional shoots is determined mainly by the structure of the embryonal shoot apex and its ontogenetic abilities, but not by the radiation level per se, the latter being responsible mainly for some kind of multicaulity inducing damage to the apical meristem, the probability of which increases with dose.  So far, our data offer no conclusive indication as to the possible nature of such damage.<p>
