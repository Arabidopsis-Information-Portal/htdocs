INTODUCTION<p>

An auxin-resistant dwarf mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana was first
described by Mirza and Maher (1980). The mutant line P445 segregates
into dwarf and normal phenotypes in a 3:1 ratio. The dwarf plants
exhibit high levels of auxin resistance and are altered in their
gravitropic response.<p>

Here we present further details of the P445 mutant including genetical
and physiological characterization. Following the genetic analysis of
the mutant, it is proposed that the mutation controlling the auxin
resitance of the dwarf mutant P445 should be given the gene symbol
Dwf.<p>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<p>

Mutant Dwf was induced and isolated in Arabidopsis thaliana L. ecotype
Landsberg, erecta mutant, as described by Maher and Martindale (1980).
The progeny of selfed Dwf plants segregate into 2, 4-D resistant and
susceptible plants. The susceptible plants are similar to the "wild
type" (WT) plants and are denoted here as "normal type" (dwf) plants,
while resistant plants have a typical dwarf phenotype and are
designated here as "dwarf-type" (Dwf) plants. Plants were cultured and
grown under conditions as described earlier (Maher and Martindale,
1980; Mirza et al., 1984). However, to avoid the confounding effect of
variability in seed sizes on seedling growth, seeds of the most common
size class (250-280 micro m, obtained by using Endecott test sieves)
were used in the present study, Dwf plants are easily
distingishable from dwf plants at early seedling stage on both perlite
and agar.<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

Growth and gravitropic response<p>

When germinated and gown on the surface of agar, Dwf seedling roots
and hypocotyls were randomly oriented in relation to gravity. However,
after about 60 h incubation, hypocotyls of some Dwf seedlings appeared
to exhibit slight negative gravitropic response. On the other hand,
dwf seedling roots and hypocotyls grew with normal gravitropic
response. The Dwf seedling roots mostly lacked root hairs whereas dwf
seedling roots developed normal root hairs.<p>

When germinated and grown on perlite, Dwf seedlings developed a very
small, dark green rosette and single unbranched roots which were often
coiled up on the surface of perlite, whereas dwf seedlings developed
normal sized green rosette and a normal root system which grew into
perlite. Dwf seedlings exhibited a lot of variability in their sizes
and many of these did not survive even if their roots were pushed into
perlite.<p>

On transplanting carefully, some of the healthier Dwf seedlings
survived and developed into typical dwarfs with shoots up to 3 cm tall
which carried fertile flowers and set seed. Mature Dwf plants had
single more or less spirally coiling roots. On the other hand, dwf
plants developed into normal plants up to 20 cm tall and had
well-developed root system.<p>

Figure 1: Development of gravitropic curvature in WT, dwf (445N) and
Dwf (445D) progeny seedlings in darkness. Seedlings were grown on
vertical agar plates for 48 h when roots and hypocotyls were
straightened and after 2 h adjustment period in the vertical position,
were horizontally stimulated for 24 h. Dwf progeny segregates into Dwf
and dwf seedlings.<p>

The elongation of seedling roots and hypocotyls on the surface of
vertical agar has been followed during 96 h of incubation. When
germinated and grown in light (Figure 2), the elongation rates of
roots in the two genotypes were similar until about 84 h of incubation
and after this period elongation rates of dwf roots were higher than
those of Dwf roots. When germinated and grown in darkness (Figure 3),
Dwf seedling roots elongated at a lower rate than those of dwf
seedlings until about 48 h of incubation, but after this period root
elongation in Dwf seedlings was much faster compared to dwf seedlings.
The elongation of hypocotyls in dwf seedlings was much faster compared
to Dwf seedlings. At 96 h of incubation, the mean hypcotyl length for
dwf seedlings was 3.9 times that of Dwf seedlings. The increased
elongation of roots was thus accompanied by reduced elongation of
hypocotyls in Dwf seedlings. A similar observation has been made in
mutant aux-1 (Mirza et al. 1984)<p>

seeds from the selfed Dwf progeny were used.<p>

Seedling response to auxins and ABA.<p>

The response of Dwf seedlings to 2, 4-D, IAA, and ABA has been
compared with that of dwf and WT seedlings in dose response
experiments (Figures 4 and 5). The response curves for Dwf on 2, 4-F
and IAA were greatly displaced to the right of those for dwf and WT
showing the highly increased resistance of Dwf roots to both auxins.
On the other hand, Dwf roots are not resistant to ABA. Ed 50 values
determined by the regression analysis of the parallel portion of the
curves are given in Table 1. Mutant Dwf has previously been described
as exhibiting 1440 folds increased resistance to 2, 4-D (Mirza and
Maher, 1980). In that experiment unsieved seeds were used and that
might have affected the results.<p>

Genetic control of DWF phenotype<p>

On perlite, the progeny of Dwf plants segregated to give 221 dwarf and
77 normal-type seedlings thus showing good correspondence to a 3:1
ratio (P=0.7-0.8).<p>

In Figure 6, the histograms illustrate the root length distribution of
WT, Dwf, F1, F2, and BC generations on agar supplemented with 0.24
microM 2,4-D. At this concentration, there was about 85% inhibition of
susceptible root growth compared with virtually unaffected root growth
of resitant seedlings giving good discrimination between the two types
of seedlings.<p>

Progeny of Dwf plants segregated into resistant and susceptible
seedlings in a 3:1 ratio. The F 1 progeny segregated into resistant
and susceptible seedlings in a 1:1 ratio. The F 1 dwarf selfed progeny
(F 2) provided a 3:1 segregation of resistant and susceptible
seedlings; whereas the progeny of F 1 normal selfed gave a root length
distribution as excepted for susceptible seedlings. The BC
distribution provided a 1:1 segregation into susceptible and resistant
seedlings. These results can only be explained if auxin-resistance of
Dwf seedlings is assumed to be controlled by a single dominant
mutation.<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol22/vol22-pg30-fig6.gif">Click here for figure</a><p>

Figure 6: Histograms illustrating the genetics of Dwf. Seeds were sown
on agar plus .24 microM 2, 4-D and after 72 h of incubation in light,
seedling root lengths were measured.<p>

In the BC progeny, all resistant seedlings had agravitropic roots
(while susceptible seedling roots could not be scored due to root
growth inhibition by 2, 4-D). Resistant and susceptible seedlings were
then transplanted to perlite and after 10 days growth, surviving
seedlings were scored for their phenotypes. Results are presented in
Table 2.<p>

Table 2: Phenotypes developed by resistant and susceptible seedlings
from the BC (F 1 dwarf x WT) after transfer to perlite.<p>

Thus it can be concluded that resistance, agravitropic response of
roots, and dwarf phenotype all are pleitropic effects of a single
dominant mutation. The mutation in the homozygous condition seems to
be lethal after seedling stage as no pure-breeding Dwf plant has been
found so far.<p>

Dwf phenotype suggests that auxin physiology and gravitropism are
controlled by single mutation. However, the modern "root cap inhibitor
hypothesis" (see reviews by Audus, 1975; Wilkins, 1977, 1979) suggests
that auxin does not have a role in root gravitropism and that ABA or
some other inhibitor is involved. As mutant Dwf is normal in its
response to ABA, it suggests that ABA may not be involved in the
gravitropic response of roots.<p>

The gravitropic response of a root is supposed to be the result of a
reaction chain in which the perception of gravity in the statocytes
induces the transport and reception of a growth hormone in the cells
of the root tip leading to differential growth at the site of
curvature. Study of root statocytes has not revealed any difference
between the mutant and WT (Olsen et al., 1984). Thus from the present
evidence it appears that the mutant may be affected in the
transduction of reception of the growth hormone. Of course, mutant Dwf
could be very important for our understanding of plant hormones.
Further study of such mutants might give some clue to the largest
single deficiency in plant hormone biochemistry. How do plant hormones
act?<p>

More details of the results presented here will be described elsewere.<p>

SUMMARY<p>

An auxin-resistant dwarf mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana, Dwf is
described. The mutant seedlings exhibit 2000-fold increased resistance
to 2, 4-D. The mutant is characterized by very small rosette, single
unbranched roots, absence of root hairs and lateral roots, and
agravitropic roots and hypocotyls. All the characteristics of the
mutant appear to be pleitropic effects of a single dominant mutation.
The mutation seems to have affected the transport or reception of
auxins.<p>
