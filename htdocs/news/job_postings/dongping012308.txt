Postdoctoral Research Associate 
 
A postdoctoral research associate position is available immediately in the Department of 
 
Crop Sciences, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), in the laboratory of 
 
Dr. Frank (Youfu) Zhao. The person will be jointly supervised by Dr. Frank Zhao and 
 
Dr. Schuyler Korban, Professor of Molecular Genetics and Biotechnology. We are 
 
looking for highly motivated candidates with a strong publication record and experience 
 
in molecular plant-microbe interactions. The research project will involve identifying 
 
pathogen-specific host genes during plant-bacterial interactions. The project provides an 
 
opportunity for training in both genetics and genomics, and interaction with UIUC’s very 
 
active research community with access to state-of-the-art research and greenhouse 
 
facilities and modern genomics laboratories. The successful applicant should have a 
 
recent Ph.D. in plant pathology, plant molecular biology, plant genomics, or a 
plantrelated 
 
field. Experience in RNA isolation, northern blot, real time PCR, and microarrays 
 
is preferred, but not required. The position is available immediately and can be extended 
 
for up to three years, but it is contingent on performance and productivity. Competitive 
 
salary with fringe benefits is commensurate with experience and qualifications.
