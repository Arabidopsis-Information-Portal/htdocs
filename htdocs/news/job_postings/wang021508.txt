A postdoctoral position is available in Haiyang Wang's Laboratory at 
the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research, Cornell University. 
The Wang Laboratory studies the molecular mechanisms of phytochrome 
signaling in Arabidopsis and crop species. Projects include studying 
two novel transposase-derived transcription factors in regulating 
phyA signaling (Lin et al., 2007, Science, 318:1302-1305) and 
regulation of HFR1 (a bHLH transcription factor) function by 
posttranslational modifications (ubiquitination and phosphorylation) 
(Yang et al., Plant Cell 17:804-821; Yang et al., Plant J. 
43:131-141; Yang and Wang, Plant J. 47:564-576). Successful 
candidates should have a Ph.D. in molecular genetics or biochemistry, 
be self-motivated and capable of independent research and 
experimental designs. A strong background in cell biology or 
bioinformatics will be a plus. Reasonable levels of writing and 
verbal communicating skills in English are required. 
       To apply, send cover letter detailing research experience and 
achievements, curriculum vitae (including course highlights and 
technical skills), and the names of three references. Please indicate 
the job code BTI #2008-06 in your application. For more information 
or to apply, please contact Haiyang Wang, Boyce Thompson Institute, 
Ithaca, NY 14853; email: hw75@cornell.edu.
