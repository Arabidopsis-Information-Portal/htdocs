It becomes extremely difficult in the course of time to exercise an
operative control over the collections of A.thaliana because of their
constant increasing.  This control according to the specially worked
out algorythm has been entrusted to the electronic computer.  The
contents of the algorythm is the following.<p>

The collection of seeds of A. thaliana is considered as a dynamic
system consisting of N lines.  Each of the lines is representing the
sum total of the genetically identical species.  In the line two
characteristics are comparable: 1) alpha (t), counted from the time
moment t, the maximal duration of the storage period for the seeds in
the line, after the expiry of which the percent of the survival of
plants in the process of restoration of the given line becomes lower
than the level P known previously; 2) beta is the time interval since
the moment of sowing up to the moment of the new generation appearing.<p>

The elaborated algorythm of the state of the collection at any time
moment t indicates the critical time t + tau, when in the collection
at least for one of the lines alpha (t) = O.  An approach of this moment
is a signal for the restoration of the corresponding lines.  At the
time moment t + tau the state of the collection is registered and the
lines to be restored are indicated.<p>

The present algorythm is also good for the control of the other plant
collections.<p>
