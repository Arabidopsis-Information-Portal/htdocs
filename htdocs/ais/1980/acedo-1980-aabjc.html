The effect of several metabolites on the growth of mutant A-154 was
tested in an effort to restore its phenotype. Formate substantially
improved the dry weight and pigment content but did not alter the
mutant phenotype (Acedo, 1979). Formate is involved in many metabolic
reactions especially in C-1 transfers for tetrahydrofolate, the
biologically active form of folic acid (Blakley, 1969).<p>

Plants were grown aseptically as described earlier (Redei, 1962). The
metabolites and other supplements were added to the media prior to
autoclaving. The plants grown in the greenhouse, were harvested 20
days after planting and dried in an oven for 18-24 hours at
85*degrees*C.<p>

Among the metabolites used as supplement to the basic media,
paraaminobenzoic acid (PABA) and malate increased the dry weight of
mutant A-154 over the wild type (Table 1).<p>

Table 1: The effects of PABA and malate on the growth of mutant A-154
(average of 3 experiments)<p>

The biological importance of PABA was recognized by Woods in 1940.
PABA is a growth factor for many microorganisms (Peterson and
Peterson, 1945) and in E. coli it functions in the synthesis of
purines and amino acids (Lampen et al., 1949). Later it was shown that
PABA is an essential part of the folic acid molecule (Angier et al.,
1946) and competitively reverses inhibition of sulfonamides (Lascelles
et al., 1952). PABA antagonized the inhibition by sulfanilamide in
Arabidopsis callus tissues (Schall and Dennison, 1978) and in excised
tomato roots (Boll, 1955). The growth of PABA requiring rat cell
mutants was stimulated by formate (Plaut et al., 1949).<p>

Malate is an important intermediate in many biosynthetic processes
especially in photosynthesis and the glyoxylate cycle. In the C4 path
of photosynthesis, malate may move from the mesophyll chloroplasts to
the bundle sheat chloroplasts and there undergo decarboxylation
(Johnson and Hatch, 1970). The Co2 released from this decarboxylating
process is used in the synthesis of sucrose and starch (Hatch, 1978).
The enzyme responsible for the synthesis of malate from oxaloacetate,
NADP-malate dehydrogenase is under regulation of a low molecular
weight protein (Hatch, 1978).<p>

The relationship of PABA and malate stimulation of growth to formate
metabolism and the primary genetic lesion of mutant A-154 is a subject
of further research. Mutant A-154 is clearly a regulatory mutant with
very diverse metabolic effects.<p>
