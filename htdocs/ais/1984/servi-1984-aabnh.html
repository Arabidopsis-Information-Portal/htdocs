Recessive lethal chlorophyll mutants are very frequent or even
prevailing in the mutation spectrum of many species of higher platns,
and A. thaliana seems not to be an exception.<p>

The present progress in the linkage mapping of A. thaliana has been
reported by Koornneef et al. (1982). Several tens of genes are mapped
by means of F 2 numerical ratios in repulsion. Only three of them,
however, are recessive lethal chlorophyll ones. Fischerova (1975)
attempted at a localization of eight mutations of this type by means
of B 1 numerical ratios in repulsion.<p>

All recent data used in the construction of the linkage map of A.
thaliana suffer from the lack of corresponding double markers so that
the estimates of the recombination fraction have to be obtained from
repulsion even if several lines homozygous for at least two markers at
the same chromosome have already been developed (Koornneef and
Hanhart, 1983). Further the estimates of p are based on F 2 numerical
ratios. This procedure is easy as compared with that based on B 1
ratios. Thus, the technique is the least reliable especially when the
distances are short.<p>

In the present paper, an attempt is made to use recessive lethal
chlorophyll mutants for linkage mapping in A. thaliana and, above all,
to study the peculiarities of an experimental system of two recessive
mutants where one mutation is visible (m) and the other is lethal for
chlorophyll deficiency (ch). For the reasons given above, repulsion
and F 2 are being considered.<p>

In the experiments, a line homozygous for m (m+/m+) is maternal,
plants heterozygous for ch (++/+ch) are donors of pollen. The latter
genotype can be taken from the progeny of a ++/+ch heterozygote. A
distinction can be made between the ++/+ch heterozygote and the ++/++
homozygote by means of an embryo test (Muller, 1963). In F 1 it will
be distinguished between the ++/m+ heterozygotes and the m+/+ch
repulsion di-heterozygotes by means of the embryo test again, and
plants of the former genotype will be discarded. thus only seeds from
natural autogamy of m+/+ch will be obtained from the remaining plants.
The gametes of m+/+ch and their frequencies are given in the last row
of the following scheme:<p>

In F2, 1/4 of plants dies due to the lethal homozygous ch/ch
constitution in the stage of cotyledons. The remaining 3/4 can be
divided into four classes: (1) by means of the external inspection
acording to their standard (+/+ and +/M = +/-) or mutant (m/m) visible
phenotype, and (2) by means of the embryo test according to the
absence (+/+) or presence (+/ch) of the segregation for the
chlorophyll mutation, respectively.<p>

The five classes and their expected frequencies are as follows:<p>

Neither the external inspection nor the embryo test are, however,
applicable in the stage of cotyledons. The census takes place among
results where the classes (i) to (iv) including their expected
frequencies and observed numbers are to be determined. If n is the
number of all plants in the stage of cotyledons, and N is the number
of plants classified as adults, we obtain<p>

N = 3/4 n<p>

Then the expected frequencies and observed numbers of the four F2
classes (i) to (iv) are the following:<p>

By means of the method of maximum likelihood estimates (Fisher, 1958),
it is possible to choose as the estimate of the unknown parameter p
the value that maximizes the probability of the observed numbers.<p>

the recombination fraction on the p value in different systems of
recessive markers:<p>

Note that not only the extent of particular F2 classes and the
expected frequencies and observed numbers but also the final formula
are quite different from those obtained for a system of two visible
mutations. Additionally, in the analyzed case the four classes (k) to
(iv) are in the 3:6:1:2 ratio under the absence of linkage.<p>

Interesting results were obtained when the effective estimation of the
recombination fraction in the system of two recessive markers, one
visible and the other lethal for chlorophyll deficiency, was compared
with that of two visible markers by means of Mather's i p value
(Mather, 1963).<p>

Figure 1 shows that the efficiency is growing with increasing strength
of linkage in the case studied, i.e., for F 2 and repulsion in the
system of one viable and the other lethal chlorophyll markers. The
efficiency is almost as high as in the case of B 1, in contrast with a
similar system of two visible markers. Also the two remaining cases
with corresponding F 2 and coupling are of lower efficiency especially
at higher p values.<p>

Thus the estimates of the recombination fraction in F 2 and repulsion
may be substantially more effective when the system of two visible
markers is replaced by the system of one visible and the other lethal
chlorophyll markers. The high efficiency of the latter system enables
to use it in linkage mapping. Whole series of linked visible-lethal
marker pairs may replace laborious three-point analyses with an
accuracy which is near to that of B 1 analysis, but it is attained by
the simplest and easiest technique based on F 2 and repulsion.<p>

The technique to correct differential viability of particular classes
and the experimental results will be published later.<p>
