Vol 01S: <h2>Interspecific Hybridization with Arabidopsis</h2><p>

F. J. KRIBBEN<p>

The taxonomic confusion within several tribes of the Cruciferae
certainly originates in the fact, that the morphological diversity
within this family in total is really not much higher than that
existing within genera of other taxa. Thus one might be inclined to
regard genera of the Cruciferae to be rather equivalent to a
species rank within other families. With this point in view
gene-exchange between cruciferous species is expected to have
frequently occurred in the course of evolution, resulting in that
taxonomic confusion demonstrated by the foregoing speaker, Ms. BERGER.
A natural classification system therefore will only be achieved by
following up the evolutionary pathway in hybridization experiments.<p>

In order to clarify the taxonomic relationships of Arabidopsis
thaliana in this way, LAIBACH (cf. 1958) since 1945 tested several
interspecific combinations. In a first set of experiments he used two
species, which from their outward appearance are of the most similar
ones to Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) HEYNH. These were Cardaminopsis
suicica (Fr.) HIIT. and Cardaminopsis arenosa (L.) HAYEK. The cross-
pollination with Arabidopsis thaliana and Cardaminopsis suecica
yielded quite a lot of seeds. But these seeds were only poorly
developed with Cardaminopsis suecica as mother plant and still worse
with the Arabidopsis thaliana female. The technique of embryo culture,
which LAIBACH (1925) for the first time had used for raising a species
hybrid between Linum austriacum *female* and Linum perenne *male* just
40 years ago, this very method enabled LAIBACH again to bring up the
hybrid Cardaminopsis suecica *female* Arabidopsis thaliana *male*. The
reciprocal he did not test at that time. This F1-hybrid Cardaminopsis
suecica Arabidopsis thaliana failed to set seed after self-
fertilization. Obviously the pollen was sterile, as no seed set was
gained even when using it in backcrosses to both parent species.
However, pollinating the hybrid with C.suecica- or A. thaliana-pollen,
LAIBACH succeeded in raising a progeny. After colchicine-treatment
with a swab of soaked cotton-wool put on the center of the rosette
some of these back-cross plants set fertile seeds.<p>

The second combination, which LAIBACH (1958) raised, was that of
Cardaminopsis suecica Cardaminopsis arenosa. The cross was successful
in both directions. In 1963 this reciprocal hybridization was repeated
in Limburg a second time in order to study the flower formation of the
hybrid. For in the first instance the hybrids were lost in the winter
season before reaching the flowering maturity. This time the hybrid
seeds were sown at the end of February 1964, 8 weeks after harvesting.
For 4 weeks the siliques were put in the open air for vernalization up
to the 21st of March, 1964. The first flower buds then were recognized
on the 30th of May, i.e., 92 days after sowing; the first flower
opened on the 9th of June, i.e. after 102 days.  Meanwhile HYLANDER
(1957) had published a paper, in which he suggested Cardaminopsis
suecica to be an amphidiploid between Arabidopsis thaliana and
Cardaminopsis arenosa.  Starting from some morphological
characteristics and from the fact as well, that the distribution of
Cardaminopsis suecica is limited to the north-european countries,
where Arabidopsis thaliana and Cardaminopsis arenosa are growing side
by side, he compared the chromosome numbers of these three species. In
Figure 1 I have summarized HYLANDERs conclusions:<p>

Figure 1: Cytogenetic relationships between Arabidopsis thaliana,
Cardaminopsis arenosa and Hylandra suecica (composed after HYLANDER
1957)<p>

Arabidopsis thaliana somatically shows 10 chromosomes, Cardaminopsis
arenosa 32 and Cardaminopsis suecica 26 chromosomes. Assuming that
Cardaminopsis arenosa is a natural tetraploid with a basic number of x
= 8, a hypothetical diploid form of Cardaminopsis arenosa, which
indeed has not been discovered anywhere, might have hybridized with
Arabidopsis thaliana, producing a plant with 13 chromosomes (ac),
which after chromosome-doubling would suit the chromosome number of
Cardaminopsis suecica. Though the so-called tetraploid Cardminopsis
arenosa of today is crossincompatible with Arabidopsis thaliana, there
is nothing against this hypothesis of HYLANDER. Actually LOVE (1961)
in accordance to this view found it worthwhile to separate this form
from Cardaminopsis and to create a new, in the first instance
monotypic genus with this species, Hylandra suecica (Fr.) LOVE.<p>

In pursuance of the forementioned phylogenetic studies we have
cross-pollinated in 1964 Cardaminopsis arenosa and Cardamine pratensis
L. Both species are predominantly selfsterile. Thus using Cardamine
pratensis as mother plant no emasculation was necessary. The cross-
pollinated flowers developed some fairly poor siliques, but containing
seeds. Therefore these siliques were dissected already before maturity
and the seeds transferred on filter-paper soaked with 10% sucrose-
solution. At the time of transplantation on the 3rd of June the seeds
were still green and glassy translucent. With the exception of one
seed which was far better developed than the others and germianted
after 3 weeks, most of the seeds remained on the sucrose-filter-paper
unaltered for 23 days, only changing their testa colour from green to
brown. They then were placed into a new petri-dish which was laid out
with filter- paper wettened with sterile water. Here they germinated
12 days later, and the green seedlings could be transplanted to soil
after additional 4 days. Unfortunately most of these plants did not
survive the following winter season. Only one (Figure 2) could be
brought up to a vigorous rosette plant, which had several
characteristics in common with the male Cardamine pratensis, such as
the larger tip-leaflet or hair features. Thus its hybrid constitution
should not be doubtful. As both parent species require cold-treatment
for vernalization, it does not take wonder that the hybrid did not
flower, growing under warm house conditions up to now continuously.
Since the end of March this plant and one of each parents as well
every night now is transferred to a refrigerator at =2*degrees*C. We
hope that this intermittent application of cold might suffice for an
induction of flowering after some weeks.<p>

These experiments are nothing but the very first beginning of an
attempt to establish a natural and phylogenetic classification system
of Arabidopsis relatives. We have in view to extend such hybridization
studies as far as possible. Figure 3 roughly shows, how a taxonomist
of today might look at the relationships of Arabidopsis thaliana.
Testing the cross-compatibility step by step between species of near
to those of more and more remote relationships, together with
karyological and genetical analyses of the obtained hybrids, will
surely place our present taxonomic conceptions on a more valid basis.<p>

Discussion<p>

BROWN: I would like to ask Dr. BERGER whether Sinapsis alba may be
grouped anyway with Arabidopsis, since especially on the basis of
similarity of morphogenesis and meristem structure and response to day
length, it is suggested that these are allied species (BERNIER, G.:
Caryologia 15, 303-325, 1962).<p>

BERGER: In the systems which I know, Sinapsis always belongs to the
Brassica-group which, I think, is not nearly related with Arabidopsis.
But I am not able to judge, how far such similarities in
morophogenesis or development might be decisive for these groupings.<p>

RATCLIFFE; Have you looked at seed coat characteristics of the
species? Is it an important taxonomic characteristic in cruciferous
groups?<p>

BERGER: Often mentioned are the winged or wingless seeds as well as
the mucous seed coat under humid conditions. All the different species
of Arabidopsis are characterized by wingless seeds and mucous seed
coat.<p>

JACOBS. Do you know something about the orign center of Arabidopsis?<p>

BERGER: The center of the Arabidopsis group seems to lie in the
West-Himalaya-Central Asia region, where most of the species grow
(e.g., A. pumila, A. mollissima etc). But the name Arabis and
Arabidopsis respectively surely originates from some species found at
first in Arabia.<p>

ROBBELEN: Most of the species of Arabidopsis have been listed by
Russian investigators, for example KOMAROV and BUSCH (Flora URSS.
VIII, 76, 1939, Moskau-Leningrad), so that the cooperation with these
colleagues would be very fruitful in this respect. But if I may make
another addition: So far as I know the natural races of Arabidopsis
found up to now have only 10 chromosomes. But in the sortiment of
Prof.  LAIBACH we found one race, collected in 1941 near Burghaun in
the Rhon, which indeed had 20 chromosomes. There were quadrivalents
and bivalents in early metaphase, and the most interesting feature
was, that this race was entirely pollenfertile and much more fertile
than such tetraploids induced by colchicine in our laboratory. The
reason might be, that in late metaphase we found all these 20
chromosomes arranged as bivalents, may be in consequence of
restriction in pairing or a high terminalisation rate. This to my
knowledge is the first case of a spontaneous 4n Arabidopsis.<p>

(Note added in proof: Meanwhile we went to see the location at
Burghaun and found a lot of Arabidopsis, but no tetraploids in
between.)<p>

REDEI; We have some tetraploid Arabidopsis of unknown origin
(spontaneous or produced by X-irradiation, but not colchicine-induced)
but this is also good fertile. It is not much larger than normal
diploids.<p>

ROBBELEN; Isn't it strange to find such a high fertility in
tetraploids and not to have the tetraploids in nature more frequently?<p>

REDEI; We have some hexaploids or more or less hexaploids, those are
much less fertile. They segregate obviously, while the tetraploids
appear stable, so disjunction should be normal.<p>

ROBBELEN; The reason for this stability of tetraploids may be the
smallness of the chromosomes which promotes the quick terminalisation
of the chiasmata.<p>

REDEI: Is it known on what basis die HYLANDER establish the
relationships between A. thaliana, A. arenosa and A. suecica; did he
see pairing or had he only some counts?<p>

BERGER: Only chromosome counts. But he took also into account they
hybridization results of Professor LAIBACH (Planta 51, 148, 1958). The
difficulty to analyse the pairing is that you cannot make the cross to
the diploid C. arenosa which has not been found in nature so far. The
tetraploids, however, are imcompatible with A. thaliana.<p>
