The inheritance of seed germination has been studied only in a few
cases and it is impossible to conclude how many and what kinds of
genes are involved (BORRIS and GUNTHER 1967).  From the early work of
KUGLER (1951) we know that the seed germination of certain Arabidopsis
populations is light dependent and may be controlled by a major
recessive factor, but maternal effects may also occur. Recent results
of SHROPSHIRE and coworkers (SHROPSHIRE et al. 1961, 1971) and our
group (KRANZ et al, 1971, 1972) have shown that the phytochrome
mechanism is involved in this process and that the promoting effect of
the activated phytochrome (Pfr) can be substituted by gibberellic acid
(GA3).  In those studies it was most important that homo-and
heteroalllic ch mutants of Arabidopsis differed significantly; but at
this time the sole responsibility of the ch genes for these reactions
was questionable.<p>

 The wildtype and two heteroallelic genotypes (ch1ch+/ch1ch+,
ch3ch3/ch+ch3) grown under greenhouse conditions have been
crossed. The seeds (F3) of the F2 plants, which were classified later
for their genotype by the leaf colour of the F3 plants, were tested in
treatments with H20 and 10E-3M GA3 solution in the dark (D) or 5
minutes with far-red (FR) plus 5 minutes red (R) radiation. The
interfering effect of paper filters (REHWALDT 1967) has been
eliminated by membrane filters (Sartorius-Membranfilter SA 11306).
The temperature was 25+ 1*degree*C and the germinated seeds were
evaluated after 12 days.<p>

Table 1 gives the data obtained, the mean frequency and its standard
deviation of the germinated seeds in the parents and selected F3 lines
of the diallel crosses. Altogether the columns show that the known
promoting effect of FR and/or GA3 is confirmed for each genotype
studied.  In the D- and H20 treatment the nonsegregating F3 lines
(parental types) equal to the parents concerned, but in the other
treatments some deviations occur especially when the second gene (ch.)
is involved. The seed germination of lines derived from the
hetrozygous F2 plants resembles the wildtype generally. Further in the
first treatment (D, H20) the values for the chlorophyll b defect of
the F2 mother plant and the germination of its F3 seeds show a
significantly negative correlation (SPEARMAN's range correlation
coefficient ??? = -0.839 with alpha &gt;&gt;0.99)<p>

germinated in the parents and F3-generation of the diallel cross.<p>

From this result it can be concluded that the genes concerned control
both characters, the chlorophyll (Cb defect) and the seed germination
(Pfr and/or GA2 reaction), but that the genetic and physiological
interactions of the two genes are complex.  ROBBELEN (1972) has shown
that in crosses involving the mutant V 81(=ch+ch3/ch+ch3) the digenic
interactions were complex too and the ratios of segregation are
modified by deficiencies of the recessives; further misclassification
could not be ruled out. This was also true for our experiments and it
may be one reason for the deviations mentioned above. Another reaon
may be that the sensitivity of light germinating in seeds for
photoinduction by red energy has been changed differently in the
genotype during storage (SHROPSHIRE et al, 1970)<p>

In summary, the data of this study have yielded that each ch gene
controls the Pr and/or GA3 dependent seed germination, but in the
recessive state both genes reveal deviation of partial complementation
depending on the photoinduction of the seeds.<p>
