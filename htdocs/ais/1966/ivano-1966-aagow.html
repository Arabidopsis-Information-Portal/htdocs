	In usual test tube culture after LANGRIDGE (1957) illuminated by fluorescent light tubes and equipped with longwise mounted test tube holders two sources of heterogeniety in growth conditions may be revealed:  firstly, non-uniformity of illumination of the outer and the inner rows of plants within the test tube holders, and secondly, somewhat differing intensity of light emitted by the middle and terminal portions of fluorescent tubes. These two sources cause rather small, but, nevertheless, detectable systematic differences in the rate of growth and development of plants located in corresponding portions of test tube holders, i.e., in the outer as compared to the inner rows, and in the middle as compared to the end part of the holders.<p>

	It is obvious, that complete uniformity may be achieved only at the considerable expense of space and light utilization.  But, it is well known that undesirable effects of excessive variation may be well compensated by adequate statistical design and analysis of experiments.  In case under question the arrangement of plants in randomised blocks seems to be most profitable.  At least two advantages of this method may be mentioned:  firstly, the arrangement of material in randomised blocks increases the accuracy of experimental comparisons to be made, and secondly, the probability of undesirable local chance aggregation of plants of any experimental variant is materially reduced relative to completely random spatial distribution of plants.<p>

	Since the choice of randomised blocks should meet the demand of less variation in conditions within than between the blocks, then, on the basis of the above considerations on the sources of heterogeniety, the four-rowed test tube holders (with test tubes arranged in chess-board order) may be subdivided into four portions: (1) the middle halves of the outer rows, (2) the same of the inner rows, (3) the terminal quarters of the outer rows, and (4) the same of the inner rows.  Then, each block is comprised of similar portions of all the involved holders.  In the simplest case, all the experimental variants are represented by equal numbers of plants in every block.  At last, but not least, within each block the actual places to be assigned for plants of the certain experimental variants are chosen at random, i.e., with the aid of tables of random sampling number.<p>

	The details of the design of experiment in randomised blocks may be found in any comprehensive statistical manual on the planning of experiments.<p>
