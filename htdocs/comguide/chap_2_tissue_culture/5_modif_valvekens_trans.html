OF VALVEKENS'S PROTOCOL

*  During the last eighteen months we have tried transforming 
Arabidopsis thaliana Landsberg erecta using numerous home-spun and 
published methods and have finally adopted the protocol of Valvekens 
et al  (Dirk Valvekens, Marc Van Montagu, & Mieke Van Lijsebettens 
1988.  Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. 85, 5536-5540.).  We have experienced a 
few problems with this method; they are:
 (i)  Depletion/degradation of auxin within shoot-induction medium (SIM) 
that results in the  death of micro-calli.  This phenomenon cannot be be 
prevented by regular transfer of explant  material to fresh medium.
 (ii)  Inefficient regeneration of micro-calli in the presence of kanamycin.
 (iii)  Poor seed set from in vitro grown plants.  Seed batches obtained 
from such plants usually  germinate poorly.

*  In attempting to overcome these problems we have found the 
following modifications to Valvekens's protocol useful.

1.  Omit N6-(2-isopentenyl) adenine and indole-3-acetic acid from SIM 
and replace with 6- benzylaminopurine (0.4 ppm) and napthaleneacetic 
acid (0.2 ppm).  Using this modified growth regulator regime we observe 
micro-calli by circa day 11, post co-cultivation.

2.  Pick off micro-calli (2 to 3 days after they first become visible) from the 
background of yellowing root explants and transfer to fresh SIM (BAP 
0.4 ppm, NAA 0.2 ppm) and continue incubation without selection.  
Shoot regeneration is very poor with selection, but in its absence circa 
60% of micro-calli regenerate.  We have not experienced any escapes 
by limiting selection (kanamycin 50ugml-1 or hygromycin 20ugml-1), to 
11 days.

3.  Transfer shoots and associated callus to GM medium (in 'Magenta' 
vessels, Sigma) and allow to bolt (circa 2-3 weeks).  Cut bolted stems 
from their callus base and then root (circa 2-4 weeks) in GM medium 
containing indole-3-butyric acid (1 ppm).  This usually ensures that roots 
connect with the shoot vascular  system.  We have found that IBA-
induced rooting is approximately 25% efficient so it is prudent to set-up 
at least four 'like' explants to ensure success.  Without roots, 
establishment of bolted stems in soil is poor.

4.  Transfer rooted shoots to soil (80% sand + 20% Fisons' multipurpose 
compost) in a high humidity environment and wean to atmospheric 
humidity over a couple of days.  Survival of successfully weaned plants is 
high (circa 90%).  Silique ripening occurs circa 3-4 weeks from transfer of 
plants to soil.  Seed set and subsequent germination are usually
