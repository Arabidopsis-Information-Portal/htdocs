Dry seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana, race Li-2, moisture content 6.8%,
1000-seed weight 4.09 mg, were treated in air with: (a) 50, 100 and
150 krad of Cs 137 gamma-rays (GR) at 23*degrees*C, at a rate of 200
krad/hr; (b) 10, 17.5 and 25 krad of fast neutrons (FN) at
21*degrees*C in reactor 'BARN', Wageningen, at a rate of 2.5 krad/hr
plus a gamma-contamination of 154 rad/hr; (c) 0.01 N unbuffered
EMS-solution, submers (anaerobic), for a period of 24 hours at
25*degrees*C, followed by washing on a filter for 15 minutes.  Each
treatment consisted of 18 x 25 seeds. There was a control of 10 x 25
seeds for treatments (a) and (b) and a separate control for treatment
(c) consisting of 4 x 25 seeds treated according to the same procedure
but with water instead of EMS.  The method of culturing has been
described by CONTANT (1966). During growth, various characteristics of
the vegetative and the reproductive stage were studied of which the
results are summarised in Table 1.<p>

Table 1: Mean +/- S.D.* of: (1) number of hours incubation needed to
attain 75% germination; (2) final percentage of germination; (3)
percentage survival after 100 hours of germinated individuals; (4)
root-length 100 hours after germination in mm; (5) number of leaves on
main stem at beginning of anthesis; (6) length of longest leaf at
anthesis in mm; (7) number of days from germination to first flowering<p>

With regard to speed of germination (1), all differences except NF
10/NF 17.5 were significant (P=0.05); for germination capacity (2),
none were significant. The rapid germination of the EMS treatment and
its control was due to prior inbibition for 24 hours; the fact that
this advance in germination was only 6.6 hours (in the control)
illustrates the blockage of the germination process by the anaerobic
conditions of soaking. Germination delay was much greater following GR
than after even a lethal dose of FN.<p>

All differences in survival (3) between treatments and their control
were significant; the EMS treatment was least affected. The survival
curve for neutrons had a steeper slope than for gamma-rays; the LD
50's were approximately 50 krad of GR and approximately 11.5 krad of
FN.<p>

Rootlength (4) was severely reduced even at the lowest radiation doses
used.  Except for the comparisons EMS-control/EMS, FN 10/GR 50 and FN
17.5/GR 150, all differences were significant (P = 0.05).  The EMS
treatment was only affected by 10% compared to its control.  Their
relatively low values suggest a detrimental effect of prolonged
submersion or an uncontrolled factor. The coefficient of variation was
much greater in the EMS treatment and its control than in the dry
control; it was hardly increased by FN but doubled after GR, which
probably mainly reflects the large physiological variability usually
resulting from GR.<p>

A high corrrelation (r=0.91) existed between survival and rootlength,
which was due chiefly to the correspondence between rootlengths less
than 2 -3 mm and the unability to survive.  A more detailed analysis,
on the FN 10 treatment only, confirmed this finding (Table 2).  The
'critical' root-length, which is probably associated with complete
inhibition of mitosis, seemed to be closer to 2 mm in the case of FN,
and closer to 3 mm in the case of GR (Table 3).  Or, for a given
root-length, survival is slightly greater after FN treatment than
after GR; this again supports the existance of more pronounced
physiological effects after GR.<p>

Table 3:  Relation between root-length after 200 hours and survival<p>

The number of leaves at the beginning of anthesis (5) is a very
insensitive criterion of radiation damage.  Few differences were
significant at P = 0.05 (control and FN 10/FN 17.5; FN 10/ GR 100; GR
50/ EMS).  Even so, there was a tendency towards a reduction in
average leaf number with dose.  Except for some irregularities,
variation coefficients increased with dose, more strongly in the case
of GR than with FN.<p>

For leaf-length (6), all treatments differed significantly from their
control; the difference between the two controls was insignificant.
The other significant differences were FN 10/ GR 100 or GR 150; FN
17.5/ GR 50 (P=0.05).  Variation coefficients increased very markedly
with dose.  The EMS treatment had a relatively high leaf-length and a
low variation.<p>

With regard to flowering date (7) all treatments differed
significantly from their control except EMS and FN 10.  Mean, standard
deviation and variation coefficient all increased with dose (except GR
150); the EMS-control was 2.5 days later than the dry control.  For a
given survival rate, the delay seems to be somewhat greater with GR
than with FN.<p>

All sterile individuals were handcrossed with pollen from control
plants, in order to study any genetic or plasmatic male sterility that
might be involved. This is reported separately (DANKERT and CONTANT,
1968)<p>
