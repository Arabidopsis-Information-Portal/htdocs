<p>
One post-doctoral position is available in the Holt Lab in the Department
of Microbiology and Plant Biology starting in the Fall of 2013 (start date
flexible).
</p>
<p>
This NSF-funded position focuses on the roles of NUCLEAR FACTOR Y (NF-Y)
transcription factors during various developmental processes, especially
the transition from vegetative to floral growth. NF-Ys have additional,
potentially intersecting, roles in light perception and stress/hormone
responses that we are also actively investigating.
</p>
<p>
The successful applicant will have a strong publication record,
demonstrated skills in molecular biology techniques and genetic analysis,
and a genuine interest in the roles of transcription factors during
developmental transitions. Additional experience in biochemical techniques
is also highly desirable. All candidates must have strong English
communication skills and a willingness to assist with the supervision of
graduate/undergraduate students in the lab.

Norman Oklahoma is a safe, family friendly, affordable city of ~125,000
people located just 20 minutes south of Oklahoma City (which includes
typical large city attractions and a very conveniently accessible airport).
In addition to all the standard amenities of a large university, Norman has
a vibrant and growing music/arts culture and many opportunities for fine
dining while still maintaining a small town feel.
