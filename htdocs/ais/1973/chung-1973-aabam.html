The effect of 6-azauracil or its riboside, 6-azauridine, on the
repression of variegation of im was reported earlier by REDEI (1967a).
Conversion of orotic acid to ribonucleic acid was inhibited by
azauracil in leaf discs of the cocklebur plant, Xanthium
pennsylvanicum Wall (ROSS 1964). Considerable evidence indicated an
interference with decarboxylation of orotidylic acid by OMP
decarboxylase. The existence of OMP decarboxylase and OMP
pyrophosphorylase in plant leaves was demonstrated by WOLCOTT and ROSS
(1967).  The presence of these two enzymes which catalyze sequential
steps in the de novo biosynthesis of uridine-5'-monophosphate (UMP)
indicated that the normal pathway of pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis
in higher plants proceeded through orotic acid and OMP.<p>

The activity of OMP decarboxylase was measured as the rate at which
the enzyme extract released C140 2 from OMP-7-C14.  The reaction
mixture typically contained in 0.5 ml buffer 10 m micro mole of OMP
(containing 0.01 micro Ci of OMP-C14), and enzyme extract. The
reaction was carried out at room temperature (20-22*degrees*C for 10
minutes in weighing bottles in which was placed a small vial
containing 0.3 to 0.5 ml of 3% KOH to collect the C14 02 released from
OMP-C14. Two 0.1 ml portions of the KOH was taken for scintillation
counting. The protein content was determined by the method of LOWRY et
al.  (1951).  One unit of enzyme was defined as that amount which
converted 1 m micro mole of OMP per hour per mg protein.<p>

Incorporation of 6-azauridylic acid in the incubation mixture
inhibited OMP-decarboxylase activity in Arabidopsis and it has been
shown that this drug is a competitive inhibitor of this enzyme also in
other organisms.<p>

Interestingly, the cellular level of OMP-decarboxylase increases in
plants cultured aseptically on azauracil media (Table 1).<p>

The level of OMP decarboxylase in white tissue of im was found to be
higher than the wild type and the green tissue of im:<p>

Further experiments with control and 6-azauracil treated plants of
both genotypes showed that the activity of this enzyme is dependent on
the stage of development:<p>

Table 3: OMP decarboxylase activity changes during development<p>

In both genotypes the effect of 6-azauracil is apparent.  When treated
with 6-azauracil there is an incrase in the level of cellular OMP
decarboxylae activity except in the 21 and 24 day plants of gi2 xv
gl2.  In these two cases, the expected difference of enzyme activity
in "im" and wild type is not entirely lear. This experiment is done
only once yet the data of Table 3 are in reasonably good agreement
with those of Tables 1 and 2.<p>

The present study indicates that the action of 6-azauracil may be due
to its conversion to 6-azauridylic acid which then inhibits the
activity of OMP decarbolylase. The accumulation of precursors in the
pathway may in turn induce the development of increased levels of OMP
decarboxylase.  KROOTH (1971) reported that when human diploid cell
strains of any genotype were grown in the presence of barbituric acid,
5-azaorotic acid or 6-azauridine, they exhibited elevated activity of
the final two enzymes of the UMP path. The drugs inhibited UMP
synthesis and this caused accumulation of substrates which in turn
increased the cellular level of the enzymes, i.e., the drugs
eventually induced more catalytic activity than the drugs could
inhibit.<p>

The effect of 6-azauracil on the improvement of plastid
differentiation in the mutant im is considerable. The leaf pigment
production in the mutant grown on azauracil media of optimal
concentrations may increase 20 fold.  In the im+ type, even when
homozygous for other genes causing chlorophyll deficiency, such an
effect cannot be seen.<p>

Azauracil or derivatives are not natural metabolites of the cell, thus
these normally poisonous drugs can only indirectly be involved in the
partial remedy of the genetic defect.<p>

The increased OMP decarboxylase level in the im mutant, relative to
the wild type, appears to be a natural reaction to compensate for
increased RNA degradation observed in the plants (REDEI 1967b).  The
beneficial effect of boosting this "defense" mechanism seems
plausible.<p>

The im mutants do not appear to be concerned with a deficiency or with
serious alterations in structural genes, since the plants can exhibit
an almost normal plastid differentiation under certain conditions.
This locus seems rather to be involved in a regulatory role which it
may perform by coordinating anabolic and catabolic functions.  In the
wild type the azauracil-induced increase in OMP decarboxylase level
may be only a "luxury" as far as plastid differentiation is concerned,
in the im mutants this increase may fill a genuine need, however.  The
primary consequence of mutations at the im locus requires further
studies.<p>
