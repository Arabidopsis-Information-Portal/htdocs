For aseptic cultures of Arabidopsis on agar medium 100 ml volume
flasks are used covered with a transparent polyethylen film of 60
micro thickness which is fixed on the glass by means of a ring rubber.
The film is sufficiently permeable for air, but impermeable for water
vapour, thus protecting the nutrient medium against drying for many
months.  Under these conditions the plants are equally open for the
upper and lateral light. The specific advantage of this technique is
the standardized gas exchange, which is more readily reproducible with
the film than with corks or layings of cotton.  The film may be
sterilized by placing it in alcohol for several days.<p>

For mass culture of Arabidopsis a device is used for accelerating and
simplifying the sowing of seeds. This represents a plastic cylinder
with small openings drilled along its axis in a definite order.  At
the top of the cylinder there is a flange which may rest on the
borders of the glass.  On the upper butt-end of the cylinder there are
some ring hollows which are filled with seeds before sowing.  The
cylinder is inserted into the glass with the agar medium, until the
flange rests upon the borders of the glass; then by means of a sterile
needle the seeds are successively thown into the holes.  To maintain
the given arrangement of the seeds the height of the cylinder should
provide for a minimum distance between the surface of the medium and
the lower butt-end of the cylinder.  The device is sterilized by
alcohol.  19 seeds are sown in each 100 ml flask.  The method can, of
course, be applied to glasses of any volume and to any quantity of
seeds.<p>
