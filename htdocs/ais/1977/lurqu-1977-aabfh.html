Thiamineless mutants of Arabidopsis have been used in DNA-mediated
experiments (Ledoux et al., 1974).  It was inferred that exogenous
bacterial genes coding for the production of thiamine or its
precursors were able to function within the plant cells so as to
alleviate their thiamine dependency.<p>

The interpretation was challenged by others (Redei et al., 1976) but
it seems that a final answer regarding the nature of some of the
"corrected" plants has yet to be obtained.  It may be that
difficulties in interpreting the results could be attributed in part
to a certain disparity in the response of these plants to
environmental conditions. Therefore, it seemed to us that it would be
of interest to assess the genetic effects of exogenous DNA in a system
where foreign gene expression would not be subordinated to complex
morphological and physiological processes. Such a system is to a
certain extent provided by cells growing in callus tissue culture.
Unfortunately, two observations preclude the use of Arabidopsis callus
tissue as such as a recipient for exogenous DNA. These are: (1)
Arabidopsis thaliana (Wilna) cells in tissue culture rapidly degrade
exogenously supplied DNA (Lurquin and Hotta, 9175) and (2) Arabidopsis
cells do not grow on standard B5 medium in the absence of added
thiamine.<p>

A preliminary observation indicated that callus tissue initiated from
seeds in the dark on B5 medium containing 1 mg/l 2,4D did not green
when transferred to light even with thiamine present in the medium.
Thus, it could be that the auxin interferred with a complex phenomenon
relating chlorophyll and thiamine syntheses. This hypothesis was
checked by initiating callus formation on B5 medium devoid of thiamine
and containing 2, 4-D concentrations ranging from 0 to 1 mg/l.
Temperature was 28*degrees*C and light intensity was 5,700 lux. At
0mg/l 1,4-D wildtype seeds developed into fully differentiated plants
as expected, showing no thiamine dependency.<p>

Thiamine (thi 433), thiazole (tz 432) and pyrimidine (py 431) mutants
rapidly died but responded to their specific metabolites, namely,
thiamine, MHT and OMP respectively at a concentration of 0.1 mM.<p>

At 0.05 mg/1 2,4-D and in the absence of thiamine, wildtype seeds
developed into an unorganized mass of tissue ca. 10 mm in diameter
after 2 months in culture. The presence of chlorophyll in this tissue
was evidenced by its green color.  Under the same cultural conditions,
callus tissue derived from the mutants was very small and brownish.
The mean wet weights were 0.625 g (wildtype), 0.011 g (thi 433), 0.016
g (tz 432) and 0.015 G (py 431) pr callus derived from a single seed.
Addition of thiamine or the specific metabolites promoted growth of
the mutant calluses and increased their wet weight 4-5 fold.  However,
these mutant calluses did not green and remained yellow-brown.<p>

At 0.2 mg/l 2,4-D and above, thiamine dependency of the wildtype
calluses showed up together with a loss of their green appearance thus
presenting a discrimination between wildtype and mutant tissues. A
control experiment carried out in the dark with B45 medium containing
0.5 mg/l 2,4-D showed very limited growth of the wildtype and mutant
calluses in the absence of thiamine thus confirming that a combination
of low auxin and light is necessary to allow full expression of
thiamine independency.  Ultrastructural studies indicated the presence
of well developed chloroplasts in callus tissue grown on low 2,4-D
(Figure 1a) whereas only proplastids were seen in tissue grown in the
presence of 1 mg/l 2,4-D (Figure 1b).  Furthermore, shoot regeneration
was readily observed 18 days after transfer of the green tissues to
PG3 medium (Negrutiu et al., 1975).<p>

We conclude from this study that (1) there seems to be a relationship
between the degree of dedifferentiation and thiamine requirement as
already suggested by Ohira et al.  (1976) and (2) cultural conditions
have been found that should allow the cloning of Arabidopsis mutant
cells putatively "transformed" to thiamine autotrophy by exogenous DNA
supplied to germinating seeds and this without the need to generate
mature plants directly from the treated seeds.<p>
