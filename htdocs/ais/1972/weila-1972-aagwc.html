NEALES (1968a,b) has shown that excised root cultures of three
wild-type strain (Estland, Pitztal, Blanes) of Arabidopsis thaliana
differ in their vitamin requirements. We studied the effects of
various organic medium components and of temperature on root growth of
strain "Dijon G".  Moreover, we tested to what extent the specific
responses of excised roots are already expressed by the growth of
non-excised primary roots in the dark.<p>

Methods: For both modes of cultivation a liquid medium was used which
included the inorganic components of White's medium and (if not
otherwise stated) the following organic components: 20 g/l sucrose,
0.1 mg/l thiamin, 0.1 mg/l pyridoxine, 0.5 mg/l nicotinic acid, 3.0
mg/l glycin.  Growth of non-excised primary roots was assessed after
various periods of submerged culture of seedlings in the dark by
measurement of the increase in length of the main axis and lateral
roots and by counts of the number of laterals. Growth of excised roots
was assessed after cultivation of a small portion (initial fresh
weight: about 20 mg) of an established root clone by measurement of
fresh and dry weight of the final root mass.<p>

Figures 1 and 2: Effect of sucrose concentration (at 27*degrees*C)
Fig. 1) and effect of temperature (with 20 g/l sucrose) Fig. 2) on
growth of primary roots.  Length of the main root (a), total length of
the laterals per root (b) and number of laterals per root (c) after 7
days of submerged culture in the dark.  Means of five replicates.
Inocula: Seedlings with primary roots of 4-5 mm length<p>

The results show that (as a consequence of suppression of
photosynthesis and shoot growth) the roots of dark-grown seedlings
behave in most respects like isolated roots:<p>

(1) Sucrose concentration: Without an exogenous sugar supply the roots
of dark grown seedlings reached only a length of 3 mm.  Their response
to various sucrose concentrations is shown in Fig 1.  Excised roots
responded in a similar way to variation of sucrose concentration.
Thus, the roots of "Dijon G" proved to be very sensitive to 100 g/l
sucrose, whereas NEALES (1968a) found that excised roots of "Estland"
are unusually tolerant of high sucrose concentrations.<p>

Table 1: Effect of vitamin addition to basal medium (with 20 g sucrose
per l) on growth over 34 days at 27*degrees*C of excised roots.  Means
of five replicates.  Inocula: 10-20 mg fresh weight<p>

(2) Thiamin proved to be essential for growth of excised roots of
"Dijon G" (see Table 1).  Without an exogenous thiamin supply the
roots of dark-grown seedlings showed only residual growth and reached
a mean length of 13 mm (indicating a limited amount of preformed
thiamin in the seedlings).  "Dijon G" differs, therefore, from the
strains "Estland" and "Pitztal" which do not require an exogenous
thiamin supply for root growth (NEALES 1968a).  A strong thiamin
requirement of roots is typical for the majority of plant species.<p>

(3) Other organic components: The results given in Table 1 show that
growth of excised roots of "Dijon G" is stimulated by addition of
pyridoxine, nicotinic acid and/or glycin, but not by addition of
biotin.<p>

(4) The effect of temperature on growth of non-excised primary roots
(Fig 2) has been found to be very similar to its effect on growth of
excised roots reported previously (WEILAND and MULLER, 1971).  Thus,
roots of "Dijon G" are much more sensitive to deviations from optimum
temperature than roots of "Estland" (NEALES, 1968a).  It must be noted
that the growth of whole plants of "Dijon G" is not inhibited at
19*degrees* C so strongly as the growth of isolated or dark grown
roots is.<p>
