Postdoctoral Position in Evolution of Plant Development 
 
Position available to study the genetic and developmental basis of 
flower diversity in the laboratory of Dr. Verónica Di Stilio at the 
University of Washington. Research is on the basal Eudicot genus 
Thalictrum (Ranunculaceae), using an evolution of development approach 
towards understanding morphological diversification of flowers. 
Arabidopsis is used as a reference system for candidate genes and to 
test gene function. Current focus is on transcription factors as key 
regulators of development, in particular belonging to the MYB and MADS 
box families, that regulate organ identity and tissue differentiation 
in the flower. 
Requirements: PhD in Plant Biology, Molecular, cellular developmental 
biology or related field. Basic molecular biology and microscopy skills 
required. Ability to perform in situ hybridizations, transgenic 
techniques, molecular evolution and phylogenetic analyses desired. 
Funding is available for 2 years beginning as early as January of 2008. 
Review of applications will begin immediately and continue until the 
position has been filled. Please send CV, research statement and 3 
reference contacts to: Verónica Di Stilio, Department of Biology, 
University of Washington, Hitchcock Hall 506, Box 351800, Seattle WA 
98195-1800. E-mail: distilio@u.washington.edu
