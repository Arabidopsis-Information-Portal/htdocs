Post doc and technician positions in Oxford

1. Post doc.
A 38-month postdoctoral position on a BBSRC-funded Pathways that limit
leaflet formation in Cardamine , led by Professor Miltos Tsiantis. 

It is anticipated that the successful applicant will start in the
summer of 2010. The aim of the project is to understand the genetic
networks that control the number, timing and position of leaflet
development in C. hirsuta; a genetically tractable compound leafed
relative of the simple leafed reference plant A. thaliana. The project
builds on previous research by the group (Barkoulas, et al. Nature
Genetics 40, 1136 - 41; Hay & Tsiantis, Nature Genetics 38, 942-7) and
would suit highly motivated applicants with high-level developmental
biology skills and an interest in the genetics of morphological
diversity. Proven research skills in developmental genetics and
molecular biology are essential, and a strong background in plant
development is highly desirable. Further particulars may be downloaded
