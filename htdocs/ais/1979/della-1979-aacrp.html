ABSTRACT<p>

The phenotype of the wax coating of 53 eceriferum mutants of
Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh is characterized by macroscopic and by
scanning-electron microscopic techniques. Based on the macroscopic
characterization of the wax coating on stems and siliques, and other
morphological deviations of wild type (i.e. semi-sterility and
dwarfness), the mutants are classified into 7 main phenotypic
categories. Based on the results of the genetic analysis obtained so
far, the minimum and maximum number of loci per main phenotypic
category have been determined. The scanning-electron microscopic
analysis of the wax coating on stems and siliques revealed that in
wild type Arabidopsis the epicuticular waxes are phenotypically
charactrized by (1) a high proportion of rodlet-shaped crytals, (2)
plate-like structures, and (3) an organized wax layer on the stem
bases, with decreasing quantity towards the siliques. In the
eceriferum mutants the rodlet-shaped crystals are reduced in size
and/or frequency or completely absent. The plate-like structures are
reduced in size and/or frequency, or completely absent in mutants
which are visually described as being waxless. In these mutants there
is often, in contrast to the wild type, a thick organized wax layer
present on the siliques and the stems.<p>

INTRODUCTION<p>

In a study about the effects of X-rays and fast neutrons (in the
presence or absence of dithiothreitol (DTT) ) on induced mutant
spectrum in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh, special attention is paid
to the mutants with altered epidermal wax coating (Dellaert, 1979).
Like in barley (Lundqvist and Wettstein, 1962), mutants with a reduced
or without wax coating are common among the viable mutants in
Arabidopsis. In Arabidopsis absence of wax coating has been variously
described as lucida (McKelvie, 1962), shiny stalk (Burger, 1971),
virescens (Redei, 1965), and conform the denotation in barley as
eceriferum (Koornneef and van der Veen, 1978). By these authors the
gene symbols lu 1 lu 2, vc-1 and vc-2, and cer have been used for this
character, respectively. The first (and only) mutant with reduced wax
coating has been described as rhomboidea (gene symbol rh), based on
the simultaneous morphological change of leaves, by McKelvie (1962).
In order to have a generally acceptable name, we have adopted the word
eceriferum for all mutants with visually reduced or absent wax
coating, and we thus use the gene symbol cer, in analogy with the
barley eceriferum mutants.<p>

In barley the large group of eceriferum mutants is charactrized by a
change in quantity or composition of the wax coating on different
organs such as spike, stem, leaf-sheath or leaf-blade. Lundqvist
(1975) has localized 988 induced and 4 spontaneous mutations at 59
loci by diallel crosses. Biochemic and phenotypic (visually and
ultrastructurally) examination of the epidermal wax coating of the
wild bype and some cer mutants showed that there is a distinct
correlation between the mutated loci involved and the phenotypic and
biochemic characteristics of the mutants. In barley it is found that
the eceriferum loci determine the synthesis and deposition of the
epicuticular waxes (Wettstein-Knowles, 1971, 1974a, 1974b, 1976).
Based on the data of the biochemic analysis from the cer mutants, the
biosynthetic pathway of different wax components could be deduced
(Wettstein-Knowles, 1976)<p>

As a means to obtain more information about the genetic control of the
structure and deposition of the epicuticular waxes in Arabidopsis, 53
isolated eceriferum mutants were phenotypically analysed (using
macroscopic and scanning-electron microscopic techniques). Based on
this analysis the mutants are classified into different phenotypic
categories, and a start is made for genetic analysis by diallel
crosses.<p>

microscopic of the eceriferum mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.)
Heynh, the number of mutants observed per main phenotypic category
(i.e., A-G), and the minimum and maximum number of loci per main
phenotypic category 1)<p>

1) Under the heading 'special remarks' other phenotypic deviations
from wild type than wax coating are presented, e.g. dw. = dwarf, ster.
= sterile, semi-ster. = semi-sterile, and complex = deviations for
several other characteristics. Based on these phenotype
characteristics (1) the phenotypic category C is distinguished from D,
and (2) the categories E, F and G are distinguished from each other.
Per phenotypic category (i.e. A to G) the total number of mutants, with
batween brackets the minimum and maximum number of loci, is given<p>

2) The 15 phenotypic formulas for the visual description of the wax
coating on silique and stem are listed in sequence of the visually
observed amount of wax coating on the silique.  For the visual
description of the wax coating the denotations: (++) = similar to wild
type; (+) = reduced; (-) = absent, are used (-/+ and +/++ are used when
seasonal variation is observed)<p>

3) + = thick organized wax layer visible on stems and siliques, in
contrast to wild type; 0 = absence of the organized wax layer on
siliques, is similar to wild type.<p>

4) (+) = plate-like structures or rods are similar to wild type in size
and frequency; (+/-) = plate-like structures or rods are reduced in size
and/or frequency; (+/=) = plate-like structures or rods are rare; (-) =
plate-like structures or rods are absent; n.t. = not tested.<p>

5) Treatment conditions: (1) Fast neutron (Nf) and X-ray (X)
irradiation, see DELLAERT (1979); irradiation dose (Gy) and
presoaking solution (0% DTT = - ; 1.2% DTT = + ) are denoted between
brackets after the code number of the mutant-line.  (2) EMS treatment
is 10 mM EMS (24 h, 24*degrees* C).  Which phenotypic categories
allelic mutants are connected.<p>

MATERIAL AND METHODS<p>

The 30 fast neutron, 11 X-ray, 10 EMS induced and 1 spontaneous
eceriferum mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana (Dellaert, 1979; Koornneef
unpublished), and also vc-2 (Redei, 1965) used in the present study
are listed in Table 1.<p>

Seeds of the eceriferum mutants and of the wild type A. thaliana
ecotype Landsberg, mutant 'erecta', were sown on perlite saturated
with a standard nutritional solution. After 5 days at 2 *degrees*C (to
break dormancy) the seeds were put to germinate at 24*degrees*C under
continuous illumination. Two weeks after sowing the seedlings were
transplanted into soil in an air conditioned greenhouse. The culture
medium and culture conditions applied, were as described by Feenstra
(1965a) and Oostindier-Braaksma and Feenstra (1973).<p>

In order to characterize the mutants phenotypically, the following two
methods were adopted:<p>

A. Macroscopic determination of the wax coating on siliques, on stems,
and on leaf blades: Under greenhouse conditions the wax coating on
rosette leaves was visually determined at the start of flowering and
approximately two weeks later on stems and siliques. In analogy to the
method used for the phenotype description of the barley eceriferum
mutants (Lundqvist and Wettstein, 1962), the wax coating of wild type
has been denoted by ++, reduced wax coating by +, and absence of wax
coating by -. The signs -/+ and +/++ have been used if seasonal
variation was observed.<p>

B. Scanning-electron microscopic determination of the wax coating on
siliques, on stems and on leaf blades: For the scanning electron
microscopic determination of the wax coating, plants were harvested
approximately two weeks after the start of flowering. Per plant
various plant part, namely (1) silique no 4, (2) 1 cm stem at silique
no 4, (3) 1 cm stem at the first cauline leaf, and (4) occasionally a
part of one rosette leaf, were exposed to liquid N2 (a few seconds)
and freeze-dried. The dried plant parts were mounted on objective
trays with a silver paste and coated with gold. The objects were
examined in a Jeol JSM-U3 scanning electron microscope. The
epicuticular wax of wild type Arabidopsis has been defined and
described by the comparison of plant parts, without and with removal
of the wax by pretreatment with chloroform. The various plant parts of
the eceriferum mutants were compared with those of the wild type
(without and with removal ofthe wax), and specific differences have
been described.<p>

The eceriferum mutants in Arabidopsis have been classified into a
number of phenotypic categories, based on the visual phenotypic
analysis of the wax coating on siliques and stems and taking into
account other morphological deviations of wild type (probably due to
pleiotropic effects of the particular cer genes). A start has been
made for the genetic analysis of the mutants by complementation tests.
Crosses were made as described by Feenstra (1965b).<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

In Table 1 the phenotype description - macroscopic and scanning
electron microscopic of the mutant collection is given.<p>

Macroscopic phenotype description<p>

At the moment of visual determination of the wax coating of the
rosette leaves it was found that (1) the rosette leaves of some mutant
lines had become necrotic, and (2) in other mutant lines, the leaves
which were originally described as glossy, showed no difference in wax
coating with those of wild type. Therefore, we decided to classify the
mutants according to the visual description of the wax coating on
siliques and stems, without taking into consideration the description
of the leaves. This reduced the possible number of phenotypic formulas
for wax coating to 25 (including wild type; ++ ++). Since moreover,
within the group of about 400 barley eceriferum mutants described by
Lundqvist and Wettstein (1962) and Lundqvist et al. (1968), no mutants
were found, which had fewer wax on stems than on spikes, and because
so far no such mutants were observed in Arabidopsis either (i.e.,
fewer wax on stems than on siliques) it is proposed to restrict the
number of phenotypic formulas for wax coating in Arabidopsis to 15.
These 15 phenotypic formulas are given in Table 1.<p>

Within the group of mutants lacking the wax coating on siliques and/or
stems, a further distinction among them is made, based on other
phenotypic deviations from the wild type, namely semi-sterility and/or
dwarfness. This is done because, as far as is known, all mutants which
are allelic to mutant F4, the one with a mutation on locus cer-1
localized on chromosome 1 (Koornneef and van der Veen, 1978), are also
semi-sterile. Moreover, this characteritic does not recombine with
waxless (van der Veen, 1976 pers. comm). We consider this to be a true
pleiotropic effect of some genes. This semi-sterility, both male and
female, is dependent on environmental conditions. During the winter
the sterility is almost complete, although the fertility can always be
restored by bagging the plant with a polythene bag (Feenstra, 1977
pers comm).<p>

For the time being we distinguish 7 main phenotypic categories
(categories A through G in Table 1).<p>

Scanning electron microscopic determination of the wax coating<p>

The use of the scanning-electron microscope provides important details
of wax depositions. In Fig. 1 the wild type phenotype of the stem of
Arabidopsis (Fig. 1a) and for comparison the phenotype of the
chloroform treated stem of wild type (Fig. 1b) are reproduced. The
latter one is characterized by a smooth surface, and therefore, all
epicuticular structures seen in Fig. 1a are wax structures. The
epicuticular waxes of wild type (stem and silique) are characterized
by: 1. An organized wax layer, and on top of it the following surface
structures; 2. irregular shaped plate-like wax structures, and 3. a
high proportion of rodlet-shaped crystals, varying in size, which
might be associated with a high *beta*-diketone or ketone content of
the was, similar to the tube-like wax crystals in Brasssica, Poa,
Eucalyptus and barley (Hall et al., 1965; Lundqvist et al., 1968).<p>

Figure 2: Epicuticular wax structures on different eceriferum mutants
in (pg 18) Arabidopsis (enlargement; 1500 x)<p>

In Table 1 the ultrastructural composition of the wax coating for each
mutant (as far as available) is given. When the scanning electron
microscopic observations of the eceriferum mutants are compared, it is
observed that there is a significant difference (p <0.005) between the
occurrence of rodlet shaped crystals in mutants belonging to the
phenotypic main categories A, B, C, and D, and in mutants belonging to
the phenotypic main categories E, F, and G (Table 1).<p>

In almost all mutants belonging to the phenotyic main categories A, B,
C and D (i.e., mutants with visually reduced or absent wax coating of
the siliques, and with wild type or reduced wax coating of the stems)
the rodlet-shaped crystals are reduced or rare in size and/or
frequency, 15 and 5 mutants, respectively (Figure 2a). This suggests
that in these mutants, genes which regulate the quantity of the
rodlet-shaped wax extrusions are affected. Exceptions are D2, in which
the rodlet-shaped crytals are absent, and A3, in which the ultra
structure of the wax coating is similar to wild type.<p>

In contrast it is found that in the mutants belonging to the
phenotypic categories E, F, and G (i.e., mutants with visually absence
of wax coating on the siliques and the stems) the rodlet-shaped
crystals are absent or rare, 11 and 3 mutants, respectively, In these
mutants the plate-like structures are absent (Figure 2b) or reduced in
size and/or frequency as well (Figure 2C). In mutant G7 the plate like
wax structures are erect and clearly crystaline with sharp borders
(Figure 2d), unlike all other plate like structures observed in
Arabidopsis so far. The ultrastructural composition of the wax coating
of the mutants visually classified as -- types, suggest that in most
cases structural genes, which are responsible for the formation of
specific wax components, are affected (in analogy with barley
(Wettstein-Knowles, 1976).<p>

The organized wax layer decreases in quantity in wild type from the
stem base towards the siliques. In the eceriferum mutants it is found
that some mutants show a thick organized wax layer on the stems and
the siliques (denoted by + in Table 1). This layer occurs mainly (0.10
<p < 0.25) on mutants in which the other surface wax structures are
severely affected (Figure 2e), i.e., in mutants which are visually
classified as -- types.<p>

When the phenotypic categories A + B are compared with the phenotypic
categories C + D, it is observed that there are no significant
differences in the descriptions of the ultrastructures of the wax
coating of the mutants. Although in the latter categories there is a
tendency towards an increasing number of mutants in which the
rodlet-shaped crystals are rare. Also between the phenotypic
categories F and G, the observed ultrastructures of the wax coating in
the mutants are similar.<p>

In Figure 2f the epicuticular wax of a wild type Arabidopsis leaf is
reproduced. It can be seen that the wax extrusions on the leaf are
different, in composition and frequency, compared to the wax
extrusions on stem and silique. The wax structures on the leaf are
rare in frequency and size, and no rodlet-shaped crystals are present.
This may be due, in contrast to the wax structures on the leaves of
maize (Lorenzoni and Salamini, 1975; Bianchi, 1978), barley (Lundqvist
et al., 1968), Brassica, Poa and Eucalyptus (Hall et al., 1965), to
the relatively short period during which wax is produced on leaf
blades of wild type Arabidopsis before the leaves die off (the life
span of rosette leaves of Arabidopsis under the greenhouse conditions
used, is approximately 2 or 3 weeks). Comparison of the wax on the
leaf of wild type with the wax on the leaf of mutants being visually
characterized by glossy leaf blades did not show distinct differences.
Therefore, it was decided to classify these mutants in a separate
mutant class.<p>

mutants from phenotypic category D mentioned, showed complementation
with the mutants referred to in this Table. The cross D2 x B3 showed
incomplete complementation. In addition, B1 did not complement with
C4, E2, F3 and G1, and B3 did not complement with C4.<p>

Genetic Analysis<p>

A start is made for genetic analysis of the eceriferum mutants by
diallel crosses (Table 2, 3 and 4). Based on the results obtained so
far, the minimum and maximum number of loci per main phenotypic
category has been determined (Table 1). In order to do this, it has
been assumed that mutants from the different main categories are non
allelic. The results of crosses between mutants of different main
categories obtained so far (Table 5) do support this assumption, since
no cases of allelism were detected in the crosses, except the mutant
line A8, which did not complement D3 and D8. This mutant line A8
carried several other mutations, e.g., lateness, curly leaves and
siliques without petioles. It is suggested that these other mutations
may have interefered with the scoring for a wax coating. All
eceriferum mutants used in the crossings were completely recessive,
except D2 which is semi dominant. The complementation between the non
allelic mutants (within and between different phenotypic categories
Table 2, 3 4 and 5) observed was always complete to wild type. Since
intragenic complementation is more often than not to sub wild type,
this complementation is not taken into consideration in our case.<p>

Comparison of the wax composition in allelic mutants and in non
allelic mutants.<p>

It is found that allelic mutants have an identical composition of the
epicuticular wax structures. There might, however, be some variation
in the density of the different wax compounds (for example the allelic
mutants A1 and A6 differ in frequency of the rods). Please note that
the allelic mutants F1, F2 and F4 have the same epicuticular wax
structure (i.e., thick organized wax layer as well as absence of plate
like structures and rodlet shaped crystals) as have the allelic
mutants G5 and G8. On the basis of semi sterility these mutants are
classified into different phenotypic categories (i.e., F and G) and it
is proved that they are non allelic. From the results of the scanning
electron microscopic analysis of the epicuticular wax stuctures of the
stems and the siliques of non allelic mutants within a phenotypic
category, it follows that especially for mutants belonging to the
phenotypic categories F and G, and scanning electron microscopic
analysis may reveal non allelic mutants. However, the results also
show that equality in epicuticular wax structures of mutants of a
specific phenotypic category does not necessarily imply that the
mutants are allelic. This seems especially true for mutants in which,
compared to wild type, the epicuticular wax structures are similar,
but reduced in size and/or frequency.<p>

CONCLUSIONS<p>

The phenotypic analysis of the wax coating on stems and siliques of
the 53 eceriferum mutants and the wild type by macroscopic and by
scanning electron microscopic techniques, revealed that the eceriferum
mutants in Arabidopsis are characterized by a change in composition
(ultrastructural) and/or quantity (visual and ultrastructural) of the
wax coating. In general it has been observed that the wax coating of
mutants with visually reduced or absent wax coating on the siliques,
and with wild type of reduced wax coating on the stems, is
ultrastructurally characterized by a change in quantity of the
rodlet-shaped crystals. The wax coating of mutants with visually
absent wax on the siliques and stems, is in general
(ultrastructurally) characterized by a change in compositon. The
scanning electron microscopic analysis of the composition of the wax
coating of the latter mutants has shown that in these mutants specific
wax "structures", such as rodlet shaped crystals and/or plate like
structures and/or organized wax layer, are severely affected.
Therefore, it is suggested that especially within their mutant group,
the mutants which differ in composition of the wax coating, might be
of interest for biochemical examination of the epicuticular waxes in
Arabidopsis.<p>

The limited results of the genetic analysis of the eceriferum mutants
obtained so far, indicate that the 53 eceriferum mutations are located
at minimal 14 loci and at the most 44 loci. This suggests that the
number of eceriferum loci in Arabidopsis is in the same order of
magnitude as the number of eceriferum loci in barley (Lundqvist,
1975).<p>
