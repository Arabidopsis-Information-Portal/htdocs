F1 seeds of a genetic stock of Arabidopsis thaliana heterozygous for
the yellow-green locus, Ch/ch, were used in all experiments on induced
genetic change. The recessive gene, ch, gives a yellow-green color in
the leaves when homozygous or hemizygous, and the presence of the
dominant gene, Ch, produces full green color, so that the F1
heterozygote has normal green leaves.  Loss of the Ch allele
(deletion) or change in its function (mutation) in heterozygotes gives
a yellowish green phenotype in leaf cells in which the phenomenon
occurs and in cell lineages of the altered genotypes.  The frequency
of F1 plants, grown from irradiated seeds, that show yellow-green
leaves (sectored or entire) was used as a measure of the frequency of
radiation induced genetic change or damage.<p>

Irradiation with heavy ionizing particles was carried out at the HILAC
machine (University of California, Berkeley). The X-ray treatments
were made with a machine operated at 250 kVp.  Since the penetrating
distances of the heavy ionizing particles are very short it was
necessary to determine the precise internal geometry of the embryo and
to position the seed consistently in order to be able to compute exact
dosimetries and to make quantitative comparisons.<p>

Experiments are in progress using He4, Li7, C12, O16, Ne20 and Ar 40
-ions.  Although final results with somatic mutations are not yet
available it is clear that in comparison with X-rays the lowest RBE's
are close to 10 and that those for He4, Li7, C12 and O16 are higher
than for Ne20 and Ar40 ions.<p>

In separate experiments the effects of these same heavy ionizing
particles on plant growth are being investigated, using both F1 and
wild type seeds.  The plants are grown on a nutrient medium singly in
test tubes and under well controlled environmental conditions (cf.
HIRONO and SMITH, this volume).  The dry weight of the plant is used
as an indicator of growth and of radiation effects. The results with
dry weight are consistent with those obtained from the mutation
experiments described above in that the RBE's show the same general
relationships.<p>
