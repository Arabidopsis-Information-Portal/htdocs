It has been well known that gibberellin promotes the flowering of
Arabidopsis plants. Some DNA nucleoside analogs also hastens flowering
of this plant (Hirono and Redei, 1966). Recently, flower-inducing
effect of salicylic acid (Cleland and Ajami, 1974) and benzoic acid
(Watanabe and Takimoto, 1979) has been reported with plants in
Lemnaceae. This information led me to try examination of the
interactions between gibberellic acid and DNA nucleoside analogs or
these organic acids.<p>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<p>

The seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana (line Estland) were sterilized with
filtrate of calcium hypochlorite (5%) for 10 min., rinsed 3 times with
sterilized water and sowed on Redei's medium including 2% glucose
(Redei, 1965) solidified with 0.8% agar in a petri dish (9 cm in
diameter). The planted seeds were placed at 3*degrees*C for 24 hr and
then allowed to germinate at 25*degrees*C for 3 days with a
photoperiod of 8 hr light (about 5000 lux, cool-white fluorescent
lamps) and 16 hr dark. A seedling of which hypocotyl has grown to 3-5
mm was transferred to a 5 ml Redei's medium in a test tube (18 x 180
mm) and allowed to grow at 25*degrees*C with the photoperiod as
mentioned above. The flower-induced plants were observed every day
with the naked eye. For each combination of the substances, 50 plants
were tested and presented as the frequency of flower induced plants.<p>

RESULTS<p>

Figure 1 shows the interaction of flower-inducing effect between
gibberellic acid (GA 3, 10E-4M) and 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU,
10E-5M). GA 3 hastened by 3 days both the time to the foremost
appearance of flowers and the time to the 50% of the plants forming
flowers (F 50) as compared with the control plants. BrdU hastened by
1.5 days the time to F 50, although it retarded the time to the first
appearance of flowers. Since the number of rosette leaves formed
before flower initiation was fewer in BrdU treated plants (8) than in
the control plants (11), the promotive effect of BrdU was clear. When
GA 3 and BrdU were rated together, flower induction was more enhanced
than when GA 3 or BrdU were treated alone. This promotive effect was
additive and not synergistic; the time to F 50 was shortened 4.5 days
by coexistence of GA 3 and BrdU, and the shortening by GA 3 and BrdU
alone was 3 and 1.5 days, respectively. Similar additive effect was
also observed in the combination of 5-bromodeoxycytidine with GA 3.<p>

Figure 2 shows the interaction between GA 3 (10 E-4M) and salicylic
acid (SA 10E-5M). Salicylic acid alone scarcely affected to flower
induction. However, when it was treated together with GA 3, flower
induction was greatly promoted as compared with that in GA 3 alone.<p>

Figure 3 shows the interaction between GA 3 (10E-4M) and sodium
benzoate (BA. Sodium benzoate alone had no effect on the time to the
first appearance of flowers, but shortened the time to F 50. This
organic acid may have greater effect on the flowering at low
concentration (10 E-6M) than high concentation (10E-5M), and inhibited
the growth of leaves and roots at concentration of 10E-4M. When it was
treated together with GA 3, the time to the appearance of flowers in
all the treated plants was shortened by 4 days in comparison with GA 3
being treated alone, although the time to the first appearance of
flowers and the time to F 50 were also similar.<p>
