Two 3-years PhD positions are available in the lab of Jenny Russinova (VIB/Department of 
Plant Systems Biology/University of Ghent, Ghent, Belgium) funded by the European ITN 
FP7 Project BRAVISSIMO (BRAssinosteroid Venture Increasing StudentS' International 
MObility). The aim of the proposed research is to study the trafficking of membrane proteins 
in the model plant Arabidopsis. The projects will focus on functional analysis of the 
endocytosis of brassinosteroid receptor complex and further understanding of its significance 
for brassinosteroid signal transduction and plant growth.
We are looking for a motivated and hard working young scientist with a solid background in 
cell and molecular biology, basic skills in biochemistry, a deep interest in receptor signalling 
and cell growth, and a nice and collegial working spirit. Experience with plants, Arabidopsis, 
GFP and microscopy is an advantage but not required.
Profile:
The applicants must have a master degree or equivalent university diploma in biology, 
molecular biology or biochemistry and be in the first four years (full-time equivalent) of their 
research careers, starting at the date of obtaining the degree which would formally entitle 
them to embark on a doctorate.
The positions are available for non-Belgium nationalities only
Good knowledge in English is obligatory.
Good communication and writing skills are a necessity
