 
 
We are seeking two motivated postdoctoral fellows to participate in exciting projects 
aimed at improving plant cell wall properties for conversion to bioproducts. These 
projects are part of a close collaboration between Drs Dario Bonetta and Janice Strap at 
UOIT and Dr Peter McCourt at the University of Toronto. If successful, one fellow will 
work in the Bonetta lab to conduct innovative genetic screens designed to identify 
potentially useful gene targets in Arabidopsis. The other fellow will be working towards 
characterizing the metabolic properties of novel microbial strains isolated by the Strap 
lab. Excellent communication skills and publications demonstrating skills in molecular 
biology, genetics and/or microbiology are required.
