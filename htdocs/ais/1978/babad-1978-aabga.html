The aim of our investigation is to reveal various factors which
regulate the activity of the main enzymes of photosynthesis: RFI (EC
5.3.1.6), FRK (EC 2.7.1.19) and RuDFK (EC 4.1.1.39). The increasing of
the synthesis of RuDFK under kinetin (6-benzilaminopurin) action is
proved by some authors: In 1968 Kende and Tavares supposed that the
influence of kinetin on the activity of photosynthetic enzymes was
similar to an allosteric effector. To prove this supposition it was
necessary to study the action of kinetin on these enzymes in in vitro
experiments. The plants of the race Enkheim and its mutant V-155/2
were taken as the subjects of investigation. This chlorophyll mutant
of nuclear origin was received from G. Robbelen, University Gottingen.<p>

The activity of the ferments of the phase of photosynthetic
carboxlation can be judged by fixation of the marked bicarbonate in
the presence of Pibozo-5-F and ATF as substrates of the reaction.<p>

Table 1: Kinetin Influence on the Fixation of NaH 14 CO3 by Ferment
Preparations in the Presence of P-5-F and ATF.<p>

From the data given in Table 1 it is seen that in all series of
experiment under influence of kinetin a considerable increase of
fixation of 14 CO 2 is observed. The degree of this increase depends
on the concentration of kinetin in the reaction mixture and on the
initial state of the ferment preparation itself conditioned by the
physiological state of the plants depending on the period of watering.
Further Table 1 shows that the less the activity of the initial
ferment preparation the more it is sensitive to the action of kinetin.<p>

In these experiments total activity of the 3 ferments (RFI, FRK and
RuDFK) was defined. So it became clear that it was necessary to
explore the action of kinetin on each individual ferment. We began
these investigations by learning the action of kinetin on the most
labile ferment (FRK). Its activity was studied from the rate of
purification of the ferment preparation and from the influence of
kinetin from the leaves of A. thaliana race Enkheim in the vegetative
phase.<p>

In Table 2 the results of the investigated dependence of FRK acting on
kinetin and the rate of purification of the ferment are presented.<p>

The data obtained show that the highest activity of the ferment FRK
from the leaves of race Enkheim in the vegetative phase is observed
when kinetin is added to the ferment mixture and when it is dialized.
According to the data presented in the table it is clear that the
activity of the ferment increases by two times without dialysis and
when kinetin is added to the ferment mixture, but the activity of FRK
increases by four times when kinetin is added and when dialysis takes
place.<p>
