PROJECT: REGULATION OF BIOLOGICAL SIGNALLING BY TEMPERATURE (ROBuST)
   
POSITION AVIALABLE: LEAD POSTDOCTORAL RA 
CLOSING DATE: 5TH JUNE 2008  
CONTACT: karen.halliday@ed.ac.uk

THIS UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY FOR ARABIDOPSIS/PLANT PDRAS WHO WANT TO 
DEVELOP A HIGH-PROFILE CAREER IN INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY.

THE PROJECT: 
We are proud to announce the £6M ROBuST project, one of six, five year UK projects 
funded by BBSRC and EPSRC. ROBuST will investigate the effects of temperature on a 
defined molecular network that controls plant development, using tightly-linked 
experimental and theoretical approaches. The ten ROBuST partners include biologists 
working on molecular signalling and climate change, mathematicians, statisticians and 
informaticians at the Universities of Edinburgh, Warwick, York and Liverpool. 

WE ARE SEEKING: 
An EXPERIENCED PDRA who will lead the experimental team at our EDINBURGH site 
and possess a high proportion of the following attributes:
  
  •	Highly organised, with strengths in team supervision 
  •	Molecular biology and genetics
  •	Experience working with Arabidopsis 
  •	Protein production and biochemistry, (Biacore SPR experience is desirable) 
  •	Experience of interdisciplinary work
  •	Proven ability to produce high-quality publications 
  •	Knowledge of mathematics will be an advantage 

Edinburgh PIs: KJ Halliday (Light/Temperature), AJ Millar (Circadian Modelling), I 
Goryanin (Computational Systems Biology), M Williams (Climate Change)
