In No. 4 of this newsletter, we have described a method of the
extraction of Arabidopsis RNA (BONOTTO and JACOBS, 1967.  This method
has been further improved.  We know from the work of REDEI (1967) that
Arabidopsis possesses enzymes capable to digest RNA: a neutral
ribonuclease, an acidic ribonuclease and a phosphodiesterase.  It is
therefore necessary to protect the RNA during extraction as good as
possible against the action of these enzymes.<p>

Although the utilization of naphtalene disulfonate (NDS) and of sodium
dodeoylsulfate (SDS) has previously provided good results, we have
tried polyvinyl sulfate (PVS) as another inhibitor of ribonuclease.
It was reported that this polyanion, introduced by FELLING and WILEY
(1959), protected very well the RNA extracted from the endosperm of
castor bean seeds at pH 5.0 (COCUCCI and STURANI, 1966).  The RNA
preparation which we have obtained from Arabidopsis seedlings with a
mixture of NDS (1 mg/ml) PVS (100 micro g/ml) and SDS (1%) seem quite
satisfactory. Besides the utilisation of PVS, we have introduced in
our method the following modifications:<p>

After precipitation from the aqueous phase by the addition of 0.1 vol
of 10% NaCl and 2.5 vol of absolute alcohol, the RNA, collected by
centrifugation, is dissolved at 0*degrees*C in a small volume of 0.01
M NaCl, containing 100 micro g/ml of PVS. The RNA solution, adjusted
to a NaCl final concentration of 2 M with solution of NaCl 4 M,
containing 100 micro g/ml of PVS is then allowed to stand 24 hours at
4*degrees*C.  In these conditions the ribosomal RNA (r-RNA)
precipitates, while the soluble RNA (s-RNA) remains in solution.  The
r-RNA is collected by cenrifugation and washed with cold 2 M NaCl in
order to eliminate the contaminant s-RNA.  The s-RNA remained in the
supernatant is precipated by the addition of 2.5 vol of cold absolute
alcohol and collected by centrifugation.  The r- RNA and s-RNA are
then dissolved in 0.3 ml of acetate bufer, layered on the top of 4.6
ml of 5-20% sucrose gradients, containing 50 micro g/ml PVS, and
centrifuged 15-16 hrs at 22.000 rev/min or 5 hrs at 37.500 rev/min in
the SW 39 rotor of the Spinco ultracentrifuge.  Two drop fractions,
collected by puncturing the bottoms of the tubes, are diluted with 0.9
ml of distilled water and the absorbance at 260 m micro measured in
the Cary spectrophotometer.<p>

Figure: Sedimentation pattern of r-RNA and s-RNA extracted from 1
month old Arabidopsis plants.  It appears from the figure that our
method allows a good separation of r-RNA, without any significant
degradation.  Moreover, a deoxyribonuclease treatment of the RNA
preparation before ultracentrifugation in order to eliminate
contaminant DNA, seems to be unnecessary.  Finally, the presence of PS
in the sucrose gradients, utilized also by MURPHY and LOVETT (1966)
for the RNA of Blastocladiella emersonii, is avantageous with respect
to NDS because it does not absorb at 260 nm.  The RNA of the whole
cells and of cellular organelles (chloroplats and mitochondria) is not
being studied.<p>
