	According to VELEMINSKY (1963) 72 kr of X-rays is a limiting dose for dry seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana.  For X-rays, however, it was found by DALY (1960a) that at 150 kr 76% of the plants still survive, when cultivated at a low temperature.  Irradiated seeds are more sensitive to higher temperature, but the survival can be increased when the plants grow at lower temperature at least for the first 4 days (DALY, 1960b).  HOLLAENDER et al. (1951) and LUCNIK and CARAPKIN (1959) proved that there is a protective of cysteine.  According to GAUZE and NOTANI (1960), the germination of irradiated maize seeds can be increased by gibberellin.<p>

	Seeds of the Arabidopsis races ST 56 (maximum germination temperature 31.5*degrees*C) and BP 4-1 (29.0*degrees*C) were X-irradiated (180 kV, 0.05 mm Al) with 36 and 72 kr and placed for germination in th following various temperature conditions in the darkness:<p>

	1.  4 days at 4*degrees*C, then 24*degrees*C,
	2.  at 24*degrees*C
	3.  4 days at 29*degrees*C.<p>

	Some lots of seeds were presoaked for 12 h in a 0.1% solution of 1-cysteine and in a 0.01% solution of gibberellin and washed for 1 hour.  There were 3 x 100 seeds in each variant.<p>

	The Figure shows that the race ST 56 was generally more resistant to the X-irradiation than the race BP 4-1.  The radiation damage was the greater the higher the temperature especially during the first 4 days.  Presoaking in a 1-cysteine solution caused an increase of germination compared with the control.  The corresponding effect of gibberellin was not so clear as in the case of 1-cysteine.  Similar results ere obtained with gamma-irradiation.<p>

	From these findings it may be concluded that the radiation damage of the seed germination can be moderated when the seeds are kept for the first 4 days at a low temperature and/or in a solution of 1-cysteine.<p>
