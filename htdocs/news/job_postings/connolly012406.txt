POSTDOCTORAL POSITION
University of South Carolina
Columbia, South Carolina

A postdoctoral research position is available immediately to study the regulation of metal uptake 
in Arabidopsis.  We are studying the regulation of the Arabidopsis genes IRT1 and FRO2, which 
respectively encode the major high affinity iron transporter and the inducible ferric chelate 
reductase enzyme responsible for iron uptake from the soil. Previously, we determined that IRT1 
is subject to post-transcriptional regulation by metals (The Plant Cell 14(6): 1347-1357); 
evidence suggests that IRT1 may be subject to metal-induced ubiquitination and removal from the 
plasma membrane.  We also have shown that expression of FRO2 is regulated post-transcriptionally 
by iron (Plant Physiol. 133:1102-1110).  Our current studies are designed to elucidate the 
molecular mechanism(s) controlling regulation of IRT1 and FRO2 by metals. A thorough understanding 
of the regulation of the iron uptake machinery will be essential for the creation of food crops 
with enhanced nutrient content.

A Ph.D. and a background in molecular biology and genetics are required. Interested candidates 
should send a cover letter, CV, reprints or preprints and the names, addresses and FAX numbers 
of three references to Erin Connolly, erinc@biol.sc.edu, Department of Biological Sciences, 
Coker Life Science Bldg., University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208. 
Telephone (803) 777-8753; FAX (803) 777-4002.  Email applications/inquiries are preferred.
