While genetic studies on Arabidopsis are progressing rapidly,
physiological and metabolic studies appear to be lagging.  One of the
reasons for this situation is the size of the organism.  In order to
obtain an appreciable mass of this material, an investigation to grow
Arabidopsis as callus culture has been started.  For the past six
months Arabidopsis thaliana callus, derived from seedlings, has been
subcultured at monthly intervals and continues to grow vigorously.
0,8% agar-medium on which the cultures are growing contains in
addition to mineral salts per liter:<p>

The complete medium is adjusted to pH 5,8 before it is autoclaved.
The callus cultures being studied require yeast extract and tryptone;
however, these two materials can be replaced by 1% coconut milk and
also by 1% tomato juice.  Studies to improve and define the medium are
in progress.<p>
