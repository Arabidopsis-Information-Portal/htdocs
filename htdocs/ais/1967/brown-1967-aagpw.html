	In previous experiments it has been shown that application of either 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR) or 5-iododeoxyuridine (IUdR) to the vegetative meristem of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) HEYNH. grown under short days results in an acceleration of floral morphogenesis (BROWN, 1962).  It was of interest to determine what effect the application of these analogues had on DNA synthesis within the meristem at various times after treatment.<p>

	Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana, race "Estland", were sown on 0.78% mineral agar in test tubes and placed in an environment of 16 hour photoperiod, 28*degrees*C +/- 1*degree*C day temperature, 22*degrees*C night temperature.  The light period was from 6 A.M. to 10 P.M.  Ten day old plants, selected for uniformity, were treated with 10 xx of 5 x 10E-4M solution of BUdR applied by syringe to the axil of the rosette.  H3-thymidine (specific activity 4.4 curies/MM, Radiochemical Centre Amersham U.K.) in solution at a concentration of 4xx/ml was applied in the same manner either simultaneously or 3, 6 or 14 hrs after the analogue treatment. Control plants were given only the H3-thymidine treatment at equivalent times. Both isotope and analogue solutions also contained 0.1% "Tween 20" and 1/4 strength mineral nutrients.<p>

	Plants were fixed either 3 or 6 hrs after addition of the isotope, using CRAF fixative.  Plants were dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 4 microns.  Sections mounted on gelatin subbed slides were deparaffinised and autoradiographed using Kodak NTB emulsion.  The slides were stored in light tight boxes containing silica gel at 4*degrees8C for 14 days before developing with Kodak D19 at 23*degrees*C for 6 minutes. After fixing the developed slides were passed through a water-ethanol-xylene series and coverslips mounted with euparal.  Slides were searched for median longitudinal sections of meristems using phase-contrast illumination.<p>

	Meristem sections were drawn in outline using the Wild drawing apparatus on a Wild M20 microscope and reduced silver grains over the tunica and corpus were plotted. The results are summarised in the table.<p>

	The grain counts are corrected for background, which was less than 6 grains per field with the 100x objective.  It is not possible in the small meristem cells of Arabidopsis to distinguish clearly between nuclear and cytoplasmic label, and the counts given thus represent the total label found over the tissue.<p>

	These results and those of previous studies (BROWN et al., 1964) indicate that H3-thymidine is present in the meristem after 3 hours; the degree of labelling is increased after 6 hours. However, BUdR treatment drastically reduces the amount of labelling within 3 hours, and in the presence of BUdR, there is no significant label due to H3-thymidine incorporation in the meristem after 6 hours.<p>

	Meristem pretreated with BUdR for 24 hours before application of H3-thymidine for a six-hour period, once again show labelling though the intensity is slightly less than the control.<p>

	The apparent inhibition of H-E3-thymidine incorporation may be due to the inability of a tracer amount of thymidine to compete with the large excess of BUdR for phosphorylation on the pathway for nucleotide tri-phosphate formation and incorporation into DNA.  It is possible that DNA synthesis may be blocked during the first 24 hours, though evidence for the incorporation of IUdR into shoot and root meristem cells during this period (SMITH et al., 1963; BROWN and SMITH, 1964) indicates that DNA synthesis does proceed in these tissues in the presence of a large exogenous concentration of the analogue.  Moreover, tracer amounts of labelled IUdR are incorporated in the presence of a large excess of "carrier" IUdR.<p>

	The reappearance of labelling due to H-E3-thymidine after 24 hours suggests that BUdR induced inhibition is of short duration, probably because the analogue is degraded rapidly and the normal biosynthesis of DNA is re-established.<p>

	It has not been possible as yet to detect any change in the distribution of H-3-thymidine incorprated in Arabidopsis meristems following incorporation of BUdR or IUdR.  An ontogenetic significance to the relatively inactive sub-apical cells of Arabidopsis (BROWN et al., 1964) and other long-day plants, e.g., Sinapsis alba (BERNIER and BRONCHART, 1963) is suggested by the effects of IUdR and IUdR on floral development.  It has also been reported that 5-bromouracil treatment increased the frequency of mitoses by 60% in root meristems of Allium cepa after 4 days (SORMOVA et al., 1960) which suggests that a wave of synchronous divisions may result from a temporary analogue-induced alteration in the rate and pattern of DNA synthesis in the meristem.<p>
