Fulbright Israel Post-Doctoral Fellowships for 
American Researchers in All Academic Disciplines 
2012/2013-2013/2014 


The United States-Israel Educational Foundation (USIEF), the Fulbright 
commission for Israel, offers 8 fellowships to American post-doctoral 
researchers in support of work to be carried out at Israeli universities 
during the course of the 2012/2013-2013/2014 academic years. 

The US Post-Doctoral Fellowship Program is open to candidates in all 
academic disciplines. 

Program grants total $40,000, $20,000 per academic year. 

Program fellows must be accepted as post-doctoral researchers by Israeli 
host institutions, which agree to provide them with a standard post-doctoral 
grant, which they will receive in addition to their Fulbright Fellowship. 
 Thus, the total financial support received by Program Fellows is likely to 
be in the range of at least $35,000-$40,000 per year. 

Applications for 2012/2013-2013/2014 Fulbright Post-Doctoral Fellowships 
must be submitted to the Council for International Exchange of Scholars by 
August 1, 2011.
