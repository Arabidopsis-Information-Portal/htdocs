INTRODUCTION<p>

In the mutant list published by Burger (1971) at least 10 mutants were
mentioned that combined yellow seeds with the absence of trichomes
(hairs) on the leaves. A similar phenotype was described by Koornneef
and Van der Veen (1978), who assigned the gene symbol ttg (=
transparent testa, glabra) to such mutants.<p>

In this report the genetics and the pleiotropic efects of ttg mutants
will be described into more detail.<p>

GENETIC CHARACTERIZATION<p>

At our laboratory 7 independently induced (both by EMS and fast
neutrons) mutants have been isolated that combined yellow seeds with
hairlessness. Complementation tests revealed that these are all
allelic and so was a similar mutant from the AIS gene bank (G31)
(Koornneef et al., 1981).<p>

In populations segregating for ttg, involving several thousands of
plants, no recombination between the glabra and the yellow seed
character was observed.<p>

Crosses of ttg mutants with 10 independently induced yellow seeded
mutants that were not hairless gave F1 plants with normal brown seeds,
indicating no allelism. The latter group of mutants represents at
least 5 different loci, that map at positions distinct from ttg.
Similarly non-allelism was concluded from crosses with three glabra
(hairless) mutants with brown seds, the F 1's having normal hairs. The
latter mutants have been mapped on chrom. 3 (gl-1), chrom. 1 (gl-2)
and chrom. 5 (gl-3).<p>

The gene ttg is located on chromosome 5 and is closely linked to ms
(Braaksma and Feenstra, 1980).<p>

MORPHOLOGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION<p>

The ttg mutants show the following contrasts with the parental
wildtype (Landsberg "erecta"). These contrasts are all qualitative and
the mutants are equally vigourous as wildtype.<p>

Plant charactrs<p>

1. The absence of trichomes on the leaf surface and the stem base.<p>

2. The absence of anthocyanins, which is very conspicuous in older
plants, when chlorophyll starts breaking down, giving wildtype plants
a purple reddish appearance and anthocyanin free mutants a yellowish
colour.<p>

See characters<p>

1. Transparent seed coat, giving the seeds a yellow appearance.
Yellowish is the normal colour of the cotyledons with ripe seed.
Unripe Arabidopsis seeds are green but the chlorophyll is broken down
shortly before complete maturation of the seeds. Upon germinantion it
can be seen that the detached seed coats of the mutants are completely
transparent.<p>

2. The absence of mucillage on the surface of the seeds. Normally,
Arabidopsis seeds develop a mucillage layer very rapidly upon
inhibition. This mucillage, which can be stained with ruthenium-red,
is difficult to remove (e.g., vacuum flask). With ttg mutants vacuum
drying of the seed surface is easy.<p>

3. A deviating seed-coat morphology.<p>

On the surface of wildtype seeds, cell-like patterns are visible with
a central elevation. Especially the latter structure seems to be
collapsed in the ttg mutant Figure 1c, d).<p>

Physiological characters<p>

1. Reduced seed-dormancy<p>

Under for wildtype seeds suboptimal germination conditions (e.g.,
freshly harvested seeds, darkness, no cold-treatment) the ttg mutant
germinates better than wildtype (Table 1).<p>

experiment: 19 days after seed harvest. Scoring: 7 days after
incubation at 25*degrees*C.<p>

DISCUSSION<p>

It is not easy to explain all deviating characters of the ttg mutants
on the basis of one single crucial substance. An attempt can be made
to correlate some of the characters. To this end ttg mutants will be
compared with mutants at other loci that possess one or more but not
all four deviating characters of ttg (Table 2).<p>

Table 2: Phenotype description of tt and gl mutants compared with
wildtype (+ presence; - absence)<p>

a. The transparent seed coat results from the absence of brownish
(melanine like) pigments in the seed coat. It seems plausible that
these substances have a same precursor as anthocyanins. This
conclusion is sustained by the occurrence of mutants at at least three
other loci, that combine the lack of anthocyanin with yellow seeds. In
fact anthocyaninless mutants with brown seeds have not been observed
so far. Conversely yellow seeded mutants with a normal anthocyanin
content of the leaves occur at at least two again different loci.<p>

b. The absence of mucillage may be a result of the deviating seed coat
observed in ttg mutants. Probably the elevating structures excrete
mucillage upon inhibition. It should be noted that other yellow seeded
mutants are normal in these two aspects.<p>

c. A relation between the absence of mucillage and hairlessness has
also been observed in the gl-2 mutant, which has a reduced number of
otherwise rather normal trichomes. Also this seed coat deviates from
wildtype as it has less well-defined cell-like structures and the
central elevation is absent or reduced (Figure 1 e + f). However, the
glabra mutants at the gl-1 and gl-3 loci have normal seed coat
structure and produce normal mucillage.<p>

(1e, 1f)<p>

The reduced dormancy of ttg mutants may be mainly a consequence of the
absence of pigments in the seed coat and to a lesser extent of the
absence of mucillage, as can be deduced from the reduced dormancy of
tt mutants compared to wildtype and gl-2. These aspects are under
further investigation.<p>

Two groups of pleitropic effects may be distinguished: on the one hand
a deviating seed coat morphology, the absence of mucillage and
hairlessness; on the other hand absence of anthocyanins and seed coat
pigments. However, a physiological link between these two groups of
characters remains obscure. A genetic explanation for the complex
phenotype of the ttg mutants may be:<p>

1. Mutational events which jointly affect two closely linked loci.
However, one would expect that mutants can be isolated at the ttg
locus in which one group of characters is affected and which show no
complementation for these characters with ttg.<p>

2. A regulatory gene is located at the ttg locus, which affects the
expression of different loci for the different groups of characters.<p>

3. A joint precursor early in the metabolic network.<p>

SUMMARY<p>

Mutants of the locus ttg (located on chromosome 5) are characterized
by the absence of trichomes (hairs), the absence of mucillage around
the seeds, a deviating seed coat morphology the absence of
anthocyanin, a transparent seed coat and a reduced seed dormancy
compared to wildtype. The interrelations between these properties are
discussed by comparing the ttg mutants with mutants at other loci,
that have some but not all characteristics in common with ttg mutants.<p>
