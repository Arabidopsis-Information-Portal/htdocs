A postdoctoral position is immediately available to work on a NSF funded project titled "Novel 
aspects of phosphorus metabolism in thermophilic cyanobacteria". 

A Ph.D. with strong training in biochemistry and molecular biology would be required for this 
position. The long term goal of this project is to gain understanding of how complex microbial 
communities acclimate to phosphorus levels in the environment. We have recently shown (based on 
genomics and biochemistry) that extremophilic cyanobacterial isolates from hot spring microbial mats 
have a complex P acquisition/metabolism circuitry and the capacity to metabolize phosphonates. 
Questions regarding the regulation of phosphorus/phosphonate utilization and its connection to carbon 
metabolism and cycling in the environment will be addressed using molecular tools and biochemical 
assays. This project is a great opportunity for a motivated person who wishes to use their skills as 
a biochemist/molecular biologist and apply it to a new and novel system. Postdoctoral fellows will 
have the opportunity to work with and train graduate and undergraduate students. The Carnegie 
Institution is on the Stanford campus, in the San Francisco Bay area, so there are opportunities for 
extensive social and scientific interactions. This position is now open (October 2010) but I can wait 
for an excellent applicant. The project is funded by NSF and the contract will be for one year at 
time and renewable based on performance. The Carnegie Institution of Science is an equal opportunity 
employer.
