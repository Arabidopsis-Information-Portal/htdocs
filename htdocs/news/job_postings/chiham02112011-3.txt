MARS Molecular Biology Postdoctoral Fellowship to identify Moniliophthora 
roreri resistance genes in Theobroma cacao 
We offer a 2 year position in a professional and highly-motivating working 
environment in a well-equipped lab at USDA-ARS Subtropical Horticulture 
Research Station (SHRS) in Miami, FL in collaboration with UC Davis. 
The postdoctoral position is for a highly skilled scientist in molecular 
biology making original contributions to a diverse set of scientific 
projects. The incumbent's main research topic will be the characterization 
of resistance to Moniliopthora roreri (frosty pod) in Theobroma cacao. The 
incumbent will characterize gene expression in inoculated and non inoculated 
resistant and susceptible genotypes. In collaboration with other scientists, 
the incumbent will also work in the fine mapping of genes linked to the 
resistance to this disease. Extensive transcriptome and phenotypic data are 
already available for this project in large mapping populations. These 
studies aim to identify gene function regulating traits of important 
agronomic value and to establish the foundations for a Marker Assisted 
Selection platform. 



Desired Qualifications
