Applications are invited for two posts for the research project "Establish the link between 
Jasmonate Signalling and Cell Cycle" in the group of Dr. Alessandra Devoto.

Post 1: Full time Postdoctoral Research Associate (ref KB/4658):
This position attracts a salary of £22,779 - £33,036 per annum inclusive of London allowance.
 
Post 2: Part time (17.5 hrs per week) Research Technician (ref. KB/4659): 
This position attracts a salary of £9,601 - £11,173 per annum inclusive of London allowance.

Both posts are for three years duration. Prior experience of molecular and cell biology (post 2) as well as microarray analysis (post 1) would be an advantage.

In this BBSRC funded project in a targeted approach, a combination of molecular biology with 
physiological, biochemical and cell biology approaches will be used to establish the role of 
JA signalling components in cell cycle in Arabidopsis. In a functional genomics approach we will 
also investigate the role of cell cycle regulators in JA-mediated stress and development.

Informal enquires to Alessandra Devoto are welcome, email: Alessandra.Devoto@rhul.ac.uk; tel +44(0)1784 443184.
