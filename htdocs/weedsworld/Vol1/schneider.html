<H2>Abstract</H2>

Twenty one mutants of <I>Arabidopsis thaliana</I> were isolated that
developed chlorosis or necrosis upon incubation at low temperature (10C -
15C). Crosses among mutants in different phenotypic classes showed that
mutants in three of four classes were found in a small number of loci. <P>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

	The term "chilling sensitivity" has been used to describe many
types of physiological damage produced at low, but not freezing,
temperatures. Typical chilling damage is wilting, necrosis, chlorosis or
leakage of ions from cell membranes (Lyons, 1973). Many targets for the
primary site of injury due to chilling temperatures have been proposed; the
theory that membrane properties are affected by chilling as a function of the
proportion of phosphatidylglycerol that contains saturated fatty acids has
gained support by recent experiments that genetically alter the fatty acid
composition of higher plant lipids (Wolter, Schmidt & Heinz 1992, Murata,
<I>et al</I> 1992).  Alterations in the amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids have
also been shown to affect chilling sensitivity (Kodama, <I>et al</I> 1994, Wada,
Gombos & Murata 1994, Miquel, <I>et al</I> 1993, Hugly and Somerville 1992).
The manifestation of chilling sensitivity that is elicited by these alterations in
fatty acid composition occurs gradually during the chilling treatment or only
upon reexposure to normal temperatures, whereas the phenotypic effects of
chilling on species of tropical or semitropical origin is often apparent within
hours or days (Lyons, 1973). Another hypothesis holds that several
physiological deficiencies, perhaps in addition to fatty acid composition of
membranes, contributes simultaneously to produce chilling damage. For
instance, some physiological processes and enzymes in sensitive plants are
less active than expected at chilling temperatures, implying that the cell dies
because of accumulated defects in metabolism or an imbalance in metabolic
pathways (Graham and Patterson 1982). <P>
	In this study chilling sensitive mutants of the resistant plant
<I>Arabidopsis thaliana</I> were isolated and genetically characterized in order to
ascertain the number of loci that can contribute to the chilling sensitive
phenotype. <P>

<H2>Materials and Methods</H2>


	<I>Plant materials and growth conditions.</I>  Plants were raised in a
growth chamber under continuous fluorescent illumination from cool-white
bulbs (70 - 100 micromols photons m-2 s-1) on a mixture of permiculite:
vermiculite: sphagnum (1:1:1) irrigated with mineral nutrients.  Chilling-
sensitive mutants were identified in three independent ethyl methyl sulfonate
(EMS)- mutagenized M2 populations of Columbia seed by growing the
plants at 22C for two weeks, then shifting to 10C or 15C.  Plants
developing symptoms of chilling injury (necrosis or chlorosis) within one
week were immediately transferred to 22C and grown to maturity. All
crosses with chilling sensitive progeny were repeated several times in both
directions to reduce the possibility that the results were due to self-
fertilization.  <P>
	<I>Growth rate.</I> To determine the critical temperature for growth of the
class 1 mutants, plants were grown at 22C until 7 days old.  Pots were then
transferred to growth chambers set at different temperatures.  Five plants
were removed and weighed separately every 3 days for 15 days.  The
average weight was plotted against the number of days at the chilling
temperature, then the growth rate was calculated from the linear section of
the graph. <P>

<H2>Results and Discussion</H2>


		Chilling sensitive mutants in <I>Arabidopsis</I> were isolated from three
independent M2 populations. One chilling sensitive mutant, PM11, has been
previously described (Schneider, Neilsen & Somerville, in press; Hugly, <I>et
al</I> 1990) and has been assigned the locus name chs1; mutant PM2 was also
identified during this previous screening.  Of 20,000 M2 plants examined in
the current study, 21 mutants were identified that appeared normal at 22C
and developed necrosis or chlorosis only when shifted to lower
temperatures.  <P>
	The chilling sensitive mutants fall into four phenotypic classes.
Class 1 mutants first turn yellow, wilt and eventually die (Hugly, <I>et al</I> 1990).
Older leaves of class 2 mutants show the same response, but younger leaves
of the rosette are completely healthy. Class 3 mutants develop yellow
patches which are not always contiguous and the veins remain green. In
class 4, the part of each leaf closest to the center of the rosette turns yellow.
Plants in classes 2, 3, and 4 eventually flowered and set seed after several
weeks at the chilling temperature. Class 1 mutants die after three days
exposure to chilling temperatures and cannot be rescued after this time by a
return to the normal growth temperature. Scanned photographs of
representatives from each class are available from in the image directory of

	Mutants were backcrossed to wild type and the phenotype of the
heterozygous F1 plants were scored to assess recessiveness or dominance of
the mutation (see Table 1).  Most of the mutants were recessive;  ST117 and
PM2 were dominant.  All mutants except ST64 and ST119 segregated in a
manner (3:1) which indicates that a mutation at a single locus is responsible
for the mutant phenotype.  Segregation of ST64 and ST119 resulted in more
wild type plants than predicted; mutations in two loci may be required for
the sensitive phenotype.	 <P>

	Segregation of chilling-sensitive phenotype in F2 progeny of 
mutants crossed towild type parent. Strains from three classes were assigned 
mutant loci based on the results ofcomplementation tests between strains as 
discussed in text. R = recessive, D = dominant, M2 =batch of mutagenized seed 
from which the mutant strain was obtained.

a. Predicted ratio of 3:1 (resistant:sensitive) for recessive and 1:3 
(resistant:sensitive)for dominant mutants.  At P = 0.05,  X^2 of 3.84 
or above would lead to rejection ofthe hypothesis of a single recessive 
nuclear mutation. b. (Hugly, <I>et al</I> 1990). <P>

	In order to ascertain the number of complementation groups giving
rise to each phenotype, mutants were crossed to each other within classes. 
Within class 1, PM11 and ST106 are in the same complementation group. 
These mutants are not siblings, as they were derived from two independent
batches of mutagenized seed (RM2 batchS in Table 1). Complementation
between Class 1 mutant strains ST117 and PM2 could not be determined
since they have dominant mutations. No resistant plants wre found in an F2
population from a cross between PM2 and ST117, thus they are members of
a single locus. The other recessive mutant in this class, ST119, complements
PM11 and ST106; in addition, resistant plants arise in the F2 populations
from crosses between either PM11 or  ST119 and  PM2 or ST117. Thus,
three complementation groups were found for the five mutants showing the
Class 1 phenotype. <P>

		Crosses between mutants in class 2, or between PM11 or ST106 and
class 2 result in sensitive F1 plants. The F1 phenotype implies that Class 2
mutants are in the same complementation group as PM11 and ST106, in
which case all F2 progeny should be sensitive. However, resistant plants
arise in the F2 generation, although there are fewer than expected for
independent segregation of two recessive mutants (data not shown). Class 3
mutants, therefore, are possibly in the same complementation group as
PM11 and ST106. <P>
	Mutants in class 3 fall into two complementation groups: ST39,
ST48 and ST83 are in one and ST34 is in another. <P>
	In contrast to the above two groups, in which the same loci were
mutated repeatedly to generate the sensitive phenotype, the nine mutants in
Class 4 are in different complementation groups. <P>
	In order to determine the critical temperature for chilling damage in
class 1 mutants, growth rates were measured upon a shift from 22C to a
range of temperatures from 10C to 28C.  As seen in figure 1, three
isolates, PM11, ST119 and ST106, ceased growth when shifted to 18C or
below. The growth rate of PM11 at different temperatures has been
measured previously (Hugly, <I>et al</I> 1990) and, similarly, was found to
decrease at 20C and to cease at 18C.  The dominant mutants, PM2 and
ST117, grew at 18C but ceased growth at 14C.  As with PM11, these
mutants could be rescued if transferred back to 22C within three days of
exposure to chilling temperatures.  The critical temperature for development
of a phenotype in the mutants which do not die was harder to assess. In
many of the mutants, a weak phenotype appeared at one temperature level
and a strong phenotype at the next lower level.  Mutants ST13, ST39, ST48
and ST35 developed a strong mutant phenotype at 18C; mutant ST64 at
14C.  The other mutants tested (ST23, ST25, ST27, ST28, ST34, ST45,
ST36, ST74, ST83, ST88 and ST115) did not develop a strong phenotype
unless chilled at 10C. <P>

	Previous studies with <I>chs1-1</I> (PM11) suggested that newly-
synthesized chloroplast-localized proteins fail to accumulate after chilling
(Schneider, <I>et al</I>, in press). In vitro import of proteins into the chloroplast
was normal in mutant cells at low temperatures; an alternate possibility is
that there is a defect in chaperonins that assisst folding of proteins after
import. Protein synthesis in class 1 and 2 mutants was investigated by
labeling leaves at normal temperatures, or after three days of chilling, with
35S-amino acids. The pattern of change in labeled proteins is the same as
that previously noted in chilled PM11 leaves for mutants ST106, PM2 and
ST117. The pattern in mutants ST64 and ST35 is similar but weaker, and
the pattern in ST13 is unchanged in chilling conditions (data not shown). 
These results suggest that Class 1 and Class 2 mutants affect the same
process, to which at least three loci contribute. 

<H2>Conclusions</H2>


	Twenty one chilling sensitive mutants were sorted into four
phenotypic classes. Analysis of these chilling sensitive mutants showed that
mutations that lead to necrosis upon chilling at 10C (Class 1 and 2) in an
otherwise chilling resistant plant fall into a small number of loci. These
mutants all show similar defects in the synthesis or stability of new proteins
at the chilling temperature. Likewise, mutations that cause chlorotic patches
(Class 3) are probably caused by a defect a small number of genes. For each
complementation group, mutants were isolated from independent batches of
seeds; this suggests that most of the loci which could contribute to the
phenotype are represented. On the other hand, changes in a great number of
loci resulted in yellowing of young tissue (Class 4) at chilling temperatures.
