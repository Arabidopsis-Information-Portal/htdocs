Introduction<p>

Previous works, summarized in part I (BOUNIAS, 1976) have shown that
both in Arabidopsis and barley leaves, L. leucine exerts an important
role on the photosynthetic apparatus.  Moreover, in barley
chloroplasts, the alkaline phosphatase activity is controlled by L.
lucine as an allosteric effector which increases enzyme activity at
low doses and decreases this activity at high doses.<p>

Although an Arabidopsis mutant was found, in which phosphatase
activity was higher and the L.leucine level lower than in original
forms, the direct effects of the amino acid on alkaline phosphatase
had not yet been determined in the crucifer.<p>

New experiments have been done in order to determine the changes in
kinetic parameters occurring under leucine action, and then
preliminary data are given on the different molecular forms (including
isozymes) separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, by
comparison with the protein spectra of the same extracts.<p>

Material and methods<p>

The seeds of Estland race were kindly provided by Prof. Dr. A.R.
Kranz.  Leaf extracts have been prepared under 0*degree*C
refrigeration by potter crushing, either directly in distilled water
(crude extracts) or after a preliminary extraction of pigments by 60%
ethanol which also removes almost 90% of free amino acids. The final
concentration was 2 mg fresh weight per ml.  Kinetic investigations
were performed by continuous photometric recording (at 400 nm
wavelength, in microcells of 200 microlitre capacity) of p.nitrophenol
released from p.nitrophenyulphosphate as chromogenic specific
substrate (S).  The parameters VA (maximum velocity), K (affinity
constant), and n (reaction order) were calculated by linear regression
of 1/V and 1/S for Vmax, and Log (V/(Vmax-V)) on Log S for K and n,
according to Hill (1910).  Electrophoresis in 7.5% acrylamide gels (in
tubes) with pH 8.5 tris-glycine buffer was conducted for 50 mn under
80v and then for 35 mn under 160v.  Proteins were stained with amido
black, and phosphatase activity revealed by incubation for 2 hours in
2-naphtyl-phosphate (20 mM) followed by staining with Fast Blue BB (15
mM).  Quantitative estimation of the values was then performed by
photometric recording. Both electrophoretic and photometric
experiments showed that including Fast Blue directly into substrate
solution before incubation decreases the enzyme activity respectively
by 88% and 71%.<p>

Kinetic parameters<p>

Figure 1 shows the dose effect curve determined for 0.3 mM substrate
concentration.  A 32% activation rate is obtained with 0.35 mM leucine
while the inhibition rate reaches only 12% with as much as 20 mM
leucine (in barley preparations, 50% activation was obtained with 0.2
mM leucine and - 62% inhibition was reached with 10 mM) BOUNIAS and
PACHECO, 1972).<p>

In crude extracts 2 kinetic forms were found, and inhibition
parameters were determined in each case with 10mM leucine added to the
enzyme preparation.<p>

In 60% ethanol treated extracts only the 1st form was found, and the
activation parameters were determined with 0.3mM leucine. The results
are summarized in Table 1 and illustrated by Figure 1b.<p>

phosphatase in Arabidopsis leaves: leucine inhibition determined in
crude extracts and activation in ethanol-treated extracts (i.e. after

Electrophoretic protein spectra<p>

Table 2 gives a first quantitative evaluation of 19 main proteic
fractions separated in crude extracts of Arabidopsis leaves, by
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the class of molecular weight
in which they are situated.  The denomination of fractions is the same
as employed for the determination of honeybee haemolymph protein
spectra (BOUNIAS, 1975)<p>

data).<p>

Electrophoretic separation of the active enzyme fractions was
performed on the same extracts as those employed for protein assays.
Photometric recordings of the proteins and phosphatase spectras are
illustrated on Figure 2.<p>

5 main forms, homologous to the A1, B1, E4, F3, and G1 fractions were
obtained with sufficient accuracy, while 3 forms, homologous to the C
group were more diffuse (as well as in the proteic spectra).  3 other
bands corresponding to A2, A3, and B2 were less active (Table 3) and
probably of questionable significance, like A1 fraction for multiple
nonspecific activities.<p>

(quantitative data are expressed for each fraction as p.c. of the
total amount).<p>

In crude extracts, under leucine inhibition, the activity was
decreased in C2, B1, C1, and G1 forms and only slightly changed in
others (Table 3).  The whole activity was 11.9% lower than in
controls, which is comparable with kinetic data (11.0% decrease by 10
mM leucine).  In ethanol treated extracts (nearer from activation
conditions because of depressed free-leucine concentrations), although
the whole activity was decreased by partial ethanol-inactivation of
proteins, the relative concentrations of both E4 and F3 forms were
almost twice as those observed in crude extracts. Then, under 10mM
leucine conditions only the activity of the G1 form underwent an
important decrease in these preparations.<p>

Conclusion<p>

These experiments have shown that in Arabidopsis leaves as well as in
barley ones, L.leucine is able to control alkaline phosphatase
activity, with activation at low concentrations but only slight
inhibition, in the case of Arabidopsis, as high leucine concentations.
In each case, the calculation of kinetic parameters gave evidence that
both activation and inhibition mechanisms are of the competitive type
(K increases and VM remains unchanged after inhibition) and that the
reaction order is not significantly different from 1: this indicates a
Michaelian process rather than an allosteric transition as found in
barley.<p>

Following polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of leaf extracts, 19
proteic fractions were separated, among which 5 to 8 main molecular
forms of alkaline phosphatase have been identified.  4 among these
active fractions showed a susceptibility to leucine inhibition and 2
others might be more favourable to activation.<p>

However, these results need further experiments, and it is expected
that electrophoresis on gel plates with acrylamide
gradient-concentrations should give better definition of the
fractions. Thus, following acid phosphatase experiments in genetic
polymorphism (JACOBS and SCHWIND, 1972; 1973, and 1975) alkaline
phosphatase might give one tool more in several ways of Arabidopsis
research.<p>

SUMMARY OF THE DISCUSSIONS OF METING III<p>

SOPORY: Does the cycloheximide concentration that you used really stop
protein synthesis.<p>

JACOBS: We have selected a relatively low cycloheximide concentration
which allowed a normal germination process and the emergence of the
first leaves. Zymograms obtained after electrophoresis of extracts
from cyclohexiride treated plants showed a typical seed pattern with a
comparable activity to that obsrved in extracts from control seeds.
On the contrary, a decrease of activity was observed for the "leaf"
bands after cycloheximide treatment when compared to the pattern of a
leaf extract from control plants.<p>

MALIGA; I would like to comment on the fact that some differentiated
cells can inactivate cycloheximide and so, after this kind of
treatment, differential effects are to be expected.<p>

MATAGNE; Did you study the thermosensitivity of the different
molecular forms obsrved in the AP1 system.<p>

JACOBS; This kind of study depends on the possibility to obtain
sufficiently purified enzymes in a sufficient amount.<p>

FEENSTRA: Is it possible to use a single plant to get an isozyme
pattern after gel electrophoresis.<p>

JACOBS; By using crude extract of 2-4 rosette leaves, it is possible
to determine the genotype of a single plant and still to keep it for
crosses.<p>

GRESSHOFF; I am a little skeptical about the fact that two proteins
should be modified by one mutation.  Does it possibly mean that you
are dealing with a regulatory mutation.<p>

JACOBS: We consider that the properties of the AP10 mutant and of the
AP1 mutant which causes a shift from I- to a F-type indicate that only
one AP1 protein is sythetized and then submitted to epigenetic
modifications.<p>

REDEI: Do you have any evidence for the existence of alkaline
phosphatase in Arabidopsis.<p>

JACOBS; After overstaining of gels in a staining mixture specific for
alkaline phosphatase, we observed only very faint bands which did not
overlap with the acid phosphatasebands. The activity of this enzyme in
a leaf extract seems to be very low.<p>

MATAGNE: In Chlamydomonas we found two "activity" mutant lines - a
neutral one and an alkaline one - when cells are grown in the absence
of phosphate.  Is it possible to use such system in Arabidopsis?<p>

JACOBS; For acid phosphatase, culture of the plants in submerged
conditions did not change qualitatively the electrophoretic pattern
and increased only slightly the total activity.  It does not seem that
we are dealing with constitutive acid phosphatase in Arabidopsis, but
the situation can be different with alkaline phosphatase.<p>

REDEI: To my knowledge higher plants do not have alkaline phosphatase
unless they are infected by microorganisms.<p>

JACOBS: The plants tested for alkaline phosphatase were grown in
sterile conditions on perlite, but we did not check a possible
microbial activity of the extract.<p>

GRESSHOFF: What is the phenotype of the AP10 mutant?<p>

JACOBS: The mutant is characterized by a slow growth and a poor seed
set.  In tissue culture the growth rate is very low.<p>

GRESSHOFF: Did you grow the mutant plant in the dark until the rosette
stage, because then it would be difficult to differentiate between
sucrose utilization and photosynthesis.  In the dark, the only carbon
source would be sucrose.<p>

D'SOUZA: No, we used continuous light.<p>

GRESSHOFF: Did you try to quantify the growth of cells and enzyme
activity in the first days of the culture.<p>

D'SOUZA: We were not able to establish good suspension cultures.
Calluses remained lumpy and it was difficult to establish a growth
curve.<p>

REDEI: When you measured the differential uptake of fructose and
glucose, this was on sucrose or on a mixture of glucose and fructose?<p>

D'SOUZA: Calluses were grown in 2% sucrose or in 1% glucose plus 1%
fructose.<p>

REDEI: You found that fructose was not taken up when jointly added
with glucose.  It could be interpreted as a glucose effect rather than
a discrimination against fructose, a kind of suppression of the
enzymes which can utilize fructose.<p>

REDEI: Do you have this mutant in stock?<p>

D'SOUZA: Only as callus. The original seed family showed a drop of the
germination percentage perhaps due to a selection againt the mutant
phenotype, but we hope to regenerate callus.<p>

VENKETESWARAN: Should it be possible to select for mutants at the
callus level?<p>

D'SOUZA: Some reports mention that invertase is actively secreted from
callus into the medium.  So it could be possible to take off the
calluses and spray a stainlayer on the agar medium or also on the
surface of the callus itself.  In this perspective we are trying to
get haploid calluses.<p>

FEENSTRA: I was wondering about the function of invertase in plants.
Could it be that the enzyme reverses the coupling of glucose to
fructose?<p>

D'SOUZA: The name invertase is applied to any enzyme that breaks down
sucrose into glucose and fructose, which can be done by four enzymes.
We have eliminated the contribution of *alpha*-glucosidase and sucrose
synthetase in Arabidopsis because sucrose synthetase requires UDP and
without addition of UDP in the extract we do not get any activity.
Now, the absence of significant differences in the growth of the
mutant on sucrose still raises the question of the function of
invertase.<p>

KRANZ: When you applied your colour test for invertase activity, is it
possible to look at differences between individual cells or only
between regions?<p>

D'SOUZA: The whole seedling is coloured, predominantly at the root
tips, cotyledons and transition region between hypocotyl and radicle.<p>

REDEI: You mentioned that the resistant mutant was a late-flowering
type, how much different is this type compared to the wild type?<p>

JACOBS: In the greenhouse, the inflorescence develops some 60 days
after sowing, instead of 25-30 days for the wild type.<p>

REDEI: For the clarity of the test, it should be better, especially if
developmental patterns are different, to study incorporation on a dry
weight basis than on a plant basis.<p>

JACOBS: Yes, but incorporation experiments were done using 8-day old
seedlings with two fully developed leaves for both mutant and wild
type.<p>

FEENSTRA: Late flowering can be shortened by cold treatment.  Did you
try to apply this treatment to your mutant?<p>

JACOBS: No, but several late-flowering strains were tested on the
effective concentration of FPhe; they were found to be absolutely
non-resistant.<p>

MALIGA: You mentioned that the rate of protein synthesis was the same
in the mutant and in the wild type. What amino acids have you used as
precursors?<p>

JACOBS: We have followed the rate of incorporation of 14
C-phenylalanine and of 14 C-leucine in seedlings.<p>

MALIGA: This effective concentration was not really toxic, because
wild type plant still reach the maturity.<p>

JACOBS: The effective concentration was defined as that particular
concentration which effects the development aspects markedly, but
without much lethality and sterility.<p>

REDEI: When you outcross the resistant mutant, the late-flowering and
the resistance goes together in the F2?<p>

JACOBS: Yes, it was the reason to grow such large F2 families to
detect possible recombination events. The genes for resistance and
compact rosette appear to be closely linked or a single mustated gene
shows pleiotropic effects.<p>

BARTHELMESS: Did you check the uptake of fluorophenylalanine by other
late-flowering types?<p>

JACOBS: No, but JAMES, as already mentioned, found no evidence for
resistance by other late-flowering strains.<p>

GRESSHOFF: That raises the question of chromosome mapping in
Arabidopsis and the best way to accomplish progress in this field.<p>

REDEI: In Arabidopsis, you can assign genes to chromosomes using the
different trisomics.  In other organisms as corn the existence of
translocation tests is very useful in mapping. Such stocks could be
developed in Arabidopsis too.<p>

KRANZ: To detect such translocations new cytological techniques as
reported by AMBROS and SCHWEITZER could be perhaps very helpful.<p>

REDEI: You do not have to use cytological techniques, which are very
time-consuming but what is very nice with translocations is that you
generate 50% sterility; in that case you have a good chance that you
are dealing with a translocation.  If linkage recombinations do not
match with your previously obtained data because the gene is linked to
two chromosomes, you have also an excellent genetic evidence for
translocations.  It is an extremely efficient technique but nobody
seems to use it in Arabidopsis.<p>
