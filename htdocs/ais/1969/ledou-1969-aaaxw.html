The short life span of Arabidopsis makes this plant quite a convenient
tool for studying the biological effects due to different exogenous
DNA.  Preliminary results, obtained by means of the technique of
chromatography on DEAE-cellulose paper pulp, on the penetration and
translocation of a highly polymerised E. coli 3H-DNA have been already
reported in Arabidopsis (BONOTTO et al, 1965).  In this note, some
data on biochemical analyses of plants treated with DNA 2H3H of E.
coli, in optimal conditions previously defined (LEDOUX and JACOBS,
this issue, page 5), are given by using ultracentrifugation in CsCl
gradients.<p>

Sterilized dry seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana, race Wil-2, were
immersed in various DNA-2H3H of E. coli, in continuous light, at
24*degrees*C for several days (DNA density = 1.730g/cm3; Fig. 1a).
After treatment, seeds were washed and sown on sterile mineral medium
with perlite as substrate.  Control seeds were treated with
3H-thymidine under similar conditions (DNA density=1.730g/cm3; Fig.
1a).  After treatment, seeds were washed and sown on sterile mineral
medium with perlite as substrate.  Control seeds were treated with
3H-thymidine under similar conditions (Arabidopsis DNA density =
1,698/cm3; Fig. 1b).<p>

Plant samples were taken at different times of the life cycle.  Their
DNA is extracted and analysed in CsCl gradients.<p>

The results summarized here are taken from an extensive study of the
uptake and retention of the labelled E. coli DNA:<p>

(1) At the cotyledon stage (Fig. 2a) radioactive DNA found in the
seedlings exhibits heterogeneity from the point of view of density.
The quantity of DNA is equal to more or less 0.01 micro g per seed,
each seed weighting 13 micro g (fresh weight).<p>

(2) With the expansion of leaves (Fig. 2b) radioactive molecules are
distributed in two main populations having a density of 1.719 +/-
0.002 and g/cm3, respectively.  Each population has been studied
separately following the method already described for plant material
(LEDOUX and HUART, 1968; LEDOUX, 1968).  The effects of ultrasounds,
of denaturation and of ultrasounds + denaturation suggest the
formation of a structure made up of exogenous and endogenous DNA,
double-stranded and bound by covalent linkages.<p>

(3) In flowering and mature plants (Fig. 2c) the distribution of
labelled molecules is strictly comparable quantitatively to the one
reported in (2).<p>

(4) In mature seeds ratioactivity repreents about 1% of the total
amount initially measured in the treated seed. The population of these
labelled molecules is either very heterogenous for density or it
includes highly depolymerised DNAs (PM+/- 500.000 daltons) Fig. 2d).<p>

(5) In M2 seedlings selected after 6 and 12 days, the labelled DNA has
a density intermediate between that of exogenous DNA and that of
Arabidopsis DNA (Fig. 2a).<p>

In the control 3H-thymidine treated seeds, the analysis in neutral or
alkaline CsCl gradients of polymerised or ultrasonicated DNAs obtained
from plants of different ages, shows the presence of a homogenous
population or labelled Arabidopsis DNA molecules.<p>

treated with E. coli DNA 2H3H (cf. text) a) cotyledons; b) plants at
rosette stage; c) mature plants; d) seeds; e) M2 seedlings<p>

In the seeds harvested from these control plants, no radioactivity was
found though the seeds were soaked in 3H-thymidine with a specific
radioactivity twenty times higher than that of the exogenous DNA.<p>
