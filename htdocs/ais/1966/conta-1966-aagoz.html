	The requirement of uniformity in Arabidopsis culture is particularly stringent in studies on the segregation of radiation-induced mutations for not easily classifiable traits, and in our stage sensitivity studies. Van der VEEN's method (1965) for uniform culture in soil involves amongst other things the transplanting of seedlings wiht a small precut cylinder of agar; a 48 h dark period is used for etiolating the seedlings in the course of germination, so that the hypocotyledons become 1-1 1/2 cm long.<p>

	As etiolation will only take place when the dark period is accurately timed in relation to the germination processes, this method leads to very heterogeneous results when applied to seeds in which these processes differ from normal in time or otherwise in an unknown manner, e.g., after irradiation.  Lengthening the dark period produced very weak seedlings, whereas shortening this period increased the heterogeneity in hypocotyledon length and germination. When, however, 30-100 lux of Philinea (tubes with wolfram spiral) were given during the 48 h dark period, etiolation was reduced to 1/3 of that in complete darkness; the plantlets were more vigorous and of more even appearance; they had larger cotyledons which became green in spite of the extremely low light intensity, even before they had fully expanded.  It appears thus possible to regulate the degree of etiolation, which may be useful in some applications.<p>

	However, in many radiobiological experiments it appears essential to have the least possible environmental changes shortly after irradiation (except those introduced as reasearch variables).  Moreover, the beneficial effect on vigour, of Philinea during the dark period, illustrates the fact that etiolation causes considerable weakening.  After considerable experimentation the following procedure was found satisfactory and less time-consuming than the etiolation method.<p>

	1.  Seeds are sown in polycarbonate petridishes and treated exactly in the manner described previously (CONTANT, 1966, this issue).  A cold pretreatment is given if it does not interfere with experimental requirements, but 3-months old seed of Li-2 germinates well without it.  The seedlings are transplanted when their roots have attained 15-20 mm.  The cotyledons are then well developed and in part of the plants the first 2 leaves are visible.  In control plants this is after 6-7 days, but in irradiated material it may take longer (when the danger of infection arises they may be transplanted with shorter roots).  Seed sterilisation may be beneficial, though infection is generally low.<p>

	2.  Seed boxes or benches are sterilised and prepared in such a way that the top inch consists of a sterilised, finely sieved leaf-mould: compost or soil: compost mixture, well and evenly moistened and not compacted.  A 2 1/2 cm deep wedge is drawn in the soil with a flat piece of metal or other suitable means.  The seedlings are gently lifted from the agar (without adhering agar) and laid, roots hanging down, on one side of the furrow at the desired spacing, with their cotyledons just above soil level. When one row has thus been completed, the next wedge is drawn at a convenient distance (4-5 cm).  This automatically closes the previous furrow. After planting the whole box or bench, it is kept covered with plastic foil for 1-2 days; watering is not necessary during this period if the pre-planting moistening has been well done.  Fungi will be avoided if the soil has been well sterilised, if the temperature is kept at 20-21*degrees*C and if light intensity is restricted during these days.  Subsequent watering should be by means of a fine spray or mist, or preferably from beneath by capillary action, as in the system used by C. W. LAWRENCE (pers. comm.), which is presently being tried.  Algal growth can be kept in check by maintaining a light and porous soil structure.  In growth-chambers, at 12000 luc of Philips TL33RS + Philinea during 16 h, a day temperature of 24*degrees*C and a night temperature of 20*degrees*C, and a relative humidity of 70%, excellent growth and development took place. Continuous light, however, was very unfavourable with this light source.<p>

	Direct sowing into shallow depressions in the soil, also suggested by  C. W. LAWRENCE, probably constitutes a further simplification, but is neither applicable to many of our irradiation experiments on different stages during and shortly after germination, nor when root measurments are to be done.  This method is, however, being tried for progeny tests.<p>
