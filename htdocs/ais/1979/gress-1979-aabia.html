Glyphosate (N-phosphonomethylglycine) is a broad spectrum
postemergence herbicide with potential to control both annual and
perennial herbaceous plants because of its high unit activity, broad
range, biodegradability by soil organisms, translocation and
favourable toxicity to animals.<p>

Much uncertainty exists about the mode of action. Studies with
Rhizobium, Escherichia coli, Chylamydomonas einhardii, carrot and
soybean cell cultures and Lemna gibba (Jaworski, 1972; Roisch and
Lingens, 1974; Haderlie et al., 1977; Gresshoff, 1979) strongly imply
the aromatic amino acid biosynthetic pathway as a site of glyphosate
inhibition.<p>

In all cases, inhibition of toxic growth inhibitory levels of
glyphosate were reversed to near normal growth by the addition of
tyrosine and phenylalanine. Both substances acted synergistically.
Tryptophan by itself did not show any significant reversal activity,
indicating that glyphosate in some form seems to interfere with that
particular side branch of aromatic amino acid synthesis.<p>

Here I report that the inhibitory effect of glyphosate on Arabidopsis
thaliana seedlings can be reversed by addition of aromatic amino
acids, thereby illustrating that the mechanism of herbicide action
appears to be the same over a large range of organisms including
bacteria, algae, cell cultures and complete higher plants.<p>

Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia wildtype) seeds were surface-sterilized
in 10% sodium hypochlorite for 10 min, then washed in sterile water
and planted aseptically onto B5 medium (Gamborg and Eveleigh, 1968)
containing trace elements, iron chelate and 2% sucrose (Gresshoff,
1979) contained in 15 mm diameter test tubes. Glyphosate and/or amino
acids were added to the medium at levels indicated in Table 1 after
autoclaving.<p>

Table 1: Glyphosate inhibition and reversal in Arabidopsis thaliana<p>

Plants were incubated at 22*degrees*C with a 16 hour photoperiod at an
illumination of about 3000 lux at plant level. Quantitative growth
yields were determined by sacrificing plants for both dry and wet
weight determination. Treatments were given to six replicates and
reported experiments represent the pooled data from at least two
separate experiments.<p>

Glyphosate lowered growth yields, especially of roots, significantly
at 0.01 mM and 0.1 mM concentration. Total root growth inhibition was
observed with 0.5 mM glyphosate. Total plant growth was also
significantly affected, especially at the 0.5 mM level. At 0.01 mM and
0.1 mM roots were stubby with small deformed laterals; extensive
browning of the entire root and adjacent medium was clearly noticeable
within 2-3 weeks.<p>

Inclusion of phenylalanine and tyrosine at 0.2 mM each negated the
inhibitory effect of glyphosate at 0.01 mM. As was found previously
with other organisms, other amino acids, or aromatic intermediates
failed to give such alleviation. Phenylalanine and tyrosine gave only
slight growth reversal at the higher, more deleterious levels of
glyphosate. Addition of phenyalalanine and tyrosine at higher
concentations proved to be inhibitory itself. The reversal effect was
only observed if added to the partially growth inhibited seedling
within the first 10 days after germination.<p>

Although these observations indicate that Arabidopsis thaliana shares
an apparently similar mode of glyphosate action with a wide range of
other organisms, it is characterized by one significant difference. In
all other biological systems tested, spontaneous alleviation from
glyphosate inhibition occured after prolonged culture, perhaps
indicating the biodegradability of glyphosate by all these organisms.
In contrast, Arabidopsis on 0.1 mM glyphosate failed to ever develop
normal roots and general plants. This provides a convenient
experimental system for the isolation of herbicide resistance mutants,
thereby allowing further analysis into the mechanism of herbicide
action.<p>
