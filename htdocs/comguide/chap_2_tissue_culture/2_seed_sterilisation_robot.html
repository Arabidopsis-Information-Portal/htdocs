*  This procedure is for sterilising small numbers of seed (up to about 
200) from large numbers of independent lines.  We have used it for 
setting up plate screens of about 4,000 lines from the DuPont T-DNA 
collection.  It may also be useful for others who are interested in plating 
large numbers of lines or families.

*  In brief, seeds are transferred to 96-well ELISA plates, sterilised using 
bleach, rinsed with sterile water, and resuspended in 0.15% agar for 
plating.  All pipetting steps are done with a Beckman Biomek 1000 
Automated Laboratory Workstation.  (Alternatively, this process should 
be adaptable for use with an ELISA plate washer or a hand- held 
octapette and a support to hold the washer or pipette at the appropriate 
height above the plate.)  Using this procedure, it is possible to transfer 
96 lines of seeds from tubes and sterilise them in about 15 minutes of 
hand work and about 25 minutes of robot work.  Seed sterility using this 
procedure is at least as good as when done by hand.  We have 
observed a low level (~1%) of cross-contamination of seeds.  Minor 
changes in the protocol could probably reduce this cross-contamination, 
but we have not attempted them since the contamination has been so 
low that it does not affect our work.  More details can be obtained from 
Tim Caspar.  If you would like a copy of the Biomek program code, send 
him a PC-formatted 3.5 inch floppy disk.

1.  OVERVIEW
 *  Seeds are removed from vials using dampened toothpicks and are 
washed into the wells of a  96-well ELISA plate in 50% isopropanol.  
Water is added manually to dilute the isopropanol.   The Biomek robot 
then draws off the dilute isopropanol, adds a bleach/Tween solution, 
then  draws this off and washes the seeds 4 times in sterile water.  Finally 
the seeds are  resuspended in dilute, sterile agar for manual plating.  A 
small amount of cross-contamination  of the wells should be expected.  
Some of the seeds (10-40%) are lost during the procedure  (the number 
is roughly proportional to the initial number of seeds in each well).

2.  SAFETY PRECAUTION
 *  The Biomek robot arm is extremely powerful and has no sensors for 
objects which may block  its path.  Never place your hands or other 
objects in the path of the robot arm while the  indicator light on the top of 
the robot arm is illuminated.  For an emergency stop of the robot,  press 
the red emergency stop button at the front, middle of the robot unit.  For 
routine  stopping, type a "/S" on the computer keyboard then a "/A" to 
abort the run or a "/C" to  continue it.

3.  SEED TRANSFER TO 96 WELL PLATES
  (i) Place 150 ul of 50% isopropanol (see note 1) into each well of a 96-
well flat bottom ELISA plate (we use Nunc-Micro Well plates, VWR 
#62409-068).
  (ii) Wet a toothpick in a dish of 50% isopropanol, dip into a seed vial and 
transfer the seeds which stick to the toothpick to a well by dipping into 
the 150 ul of isopropanol in the well (see notes 2 and 3).
  (iii) After seeds are distributed to all wells and within 20 minutes, add 
100 ul water to each well to dilute the isopropanol.  As soon as possible 
after the seeds are distributed, begin the sterilisation treatment in order 
to minimize their exposure to the isopropanol.

4.  BIOMEK STERILISATION PROTOCOL (see note 4)
  (i) Remove 190 ul from each well and transfer to a waste reservoir (see 
note 5)
  (ii) Add 200 ul bleach/Tween solution (50% bleach, 0.02% Tween)
  (iii) Add 50 ul bleach/tween solution (see note 6)
  (iv) Remove 200 ul to waste
  (v) Add 150 ul sterile water
  (vi) Remove 200 ul to waste
  (vii) Wash subroutine, repeated 3 times: 
(a)  add 200 ul sterile water
(b)  remove 200 ul to waste
  (viii) Rinse pipette tips in water, then agar
  (ix) Add 75 ul sterile 0.15% agar (see note 7)

5..NOTES
  (i) The isopropanol in the 96-well plate is critically important. 
It wets the seeds so they sink in the sterilising and rinse solutions
and also reduces the swelling of the seed mucilage so they clump
together less.  The seeds are not injured by exposure to isopropanol
for the indicated times. 
  (ii) During seed transfer to the plates, the seeds will stick to the 
moistened area of the toothpick.   By varying the depth the toothpicks 
are moistened or the type of toothpick used, the number of seeds 
transferred can be adjusted.
  (iii) To reduce the chances of cross-contamination during transfer of 
seeds to the 96-well plates, a Plexiglass mask is used which covers the 
plate and has a single hole in it which is lined up over the target well.  In 
addition, the plate and the mask are placed on an anti-static mat 
(available from office supply stores) to reduce the static which causes 
the seeds to fly around.
  (iv) The entire Biomek unit is placed inside a laminar flow hood.  
Reservoirs for solutions are sterilised by immersion in 70% ethanol.
  (v) One set of tips is used for the pipetting series for an entire plate.  To 
minimize cross-contamination between wells caused by seeds sticking 
to the tips, the pipette tips are rinsed with 100% ethanol after each 
removal of solution from the plate in steps (i), (iv), (vi), and (vii)b.   For 
applications which require less cross-contamination, the tips can be 
washed more vigorously or changed more frequently.
  (vi) Pipetting steps are determined by the capacity of the octapette 
(200 ul), the total volume of the wells in the plate, the height above the 
bottom of the well that the pipette must maintain to minimize loss of the 
seeds, and the volumes of the reservoirs on the Biomek.
  (vii) Resuspension of the seeds in 0.15% agar aids in plating since they 
remain suspended by the high viscosity of this liquid.  For some 
applications this is not useful and step (ix) can be omitted.
