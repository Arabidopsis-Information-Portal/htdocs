<h1 align=center>Call for Experts to Aid in AGI Annotation</h1>

The following message, from <a href="mailto:parnell@cshl.org">Larry Parnell</a> (<a href="http://www.cshl.org/arabweb/">CSHL</a>) and <a href="mailto:schueller@mips.embnet.org">Christine Schueller</a> (<a href="http://mips.gsf.de/">MIPS</a>), calls for <b>researchers to volunteer to aid with
the annotation of AGI sequence</b>. It was placed on the Arabidopsis
newsgroup on Feb. 5, 1998.

<br>
We are assembling a list of researchers with expertise in a given gene
family or protein group for the purpose of assisting the annotators of
the genomic sequence data. It is our desire that these individuals
will provide to the annotators their knowledge of a particular gene
family, thus resulting in more accurate and richer annotation. This
strengthening of ties between the research and genome communities can
only benefit both groups.

<p>

We anticipate that the annotators will continue to perform the bulk of
the work in modeling genes and conducting database searches. However,
there are instances when it would be useful to enlist the advice of a
colleague. For example, that colleague can impart knowledge of the
biological role of the protein and this information can be most useful
to the annotator as s/he decides between alternate gene models or in
his/her desire to attach that biological information to the sequence.

<p>

Please consider lending your services. Our list of experts is publicly
available and can be viewed at<p>
