We have reported (Corcos, 1980) that plants of the variety Columbia
germinate, but do not grow under two-hour illumination, and that they
resume growth under three-hour illumination. Further experimentation
indicates that under this illumination they grow slowly to the rosette
stage, producing a large number of leaves, but no flower stalks. Under
five-hour illumination, germination on a mineral medium was comparable
(92.5%) to the one of a mineral plus 2% sugar medium, but the growth
was considerably better on the sugar medium. Attempts to make these
plants flower under 5, 6, seven-hour illumination were unsuccessful.
However, under eight-hour illumination, they flowered and seeded.<p>

It seems, therefore, that photoperiods shorter than eight hours
prevent budding in the Columbia variety of Arabidopsis.<p>
