The invertase activity of Arabidopsis has been fractionated on
polyacrylamide gradient gels into two, well-separated bands (MAHER,
1974).  The position of the first, higher molecular weight band
depended on whether the source of enzyme was leaves or roots and, in
the case of roots, differences between races were also found. The
present report deals with further attempts to fractionate and
characterise the enzyme activities.  Unless otherwise stated
conditions of electrophoresis were as previously described using the
race Landsberg (erecta mutant).<p>

In most electrophoretic procedures, protein fractionation depends on
both net charge and molecular weight.  On polyacrylamide gradient gels
however, the fractionation depends ultimately on molecular weight also
the speed of separation will be affected by charge differences. At
their pore-limits the protein fractions are virtually stationary and
narrow bands may be obtained even from crude extracts. This is
important when working with enzymes such as invertase, which appear to
be hetrogenous in single concentration gels, but means that charge
difference polymorphisms are not readily detectable. That the bands of
invertase activity represent different molecular weight forms is
readily illustrated by increasing the time allowed for separation.
When crude leaf and root extracts were fractioned on 4-24% gradient
gels for 20 and 40 hours, the positions of the bands of activity were
identical, demonstrating that the bands had reached their pore limits
during the normal 20 hour separation period.<p>

By this time proteins of less than about 3 x 10 4 molecular weight
would have run off the end of the gel.  To check that no low molecular
weight bands of invertase were being lost in this way a separation
time of 2 1/2 hours was used (until a bromophenol blue marker had
reached the end of the gel).  At that stage relatively diffuse first
and second bands were detectable, but there was no evidence of a lower
mulecular weight fraction. Further, no extra bands were found when the
pH of the box buffer was raised to 9.5 (from 8.3) or when the polarity
was reversed.<p>

Therefore, gradient gels provide a reliable and reproducible method of
detecting multiple forms of invertase from Arabidopsis tissue. The gel
may be stained for either ketose or aldose reducing sugars and in this
way both the fructose and glucose products of sucrose hydrolysis have
been detected.  When suitable protein standards were run with the
plant extracts the molecular weights of the invertase bands were
estimated to be between 4.5 and 5.5 x 10E-5 for the first bands,
depending on the source, and about 7.5 x 10 4 for the second bands.
In crude leaf extracts stained for protein there is a very prominent
band of about 5.5 x 10 5 molecular weight in the same position as the
invertase activity. The prominence of this band suggests that it may
be Fraction 1 which is known to make up the bulk of leaf protein
(KUNG, 1976) and its presence may interfere with the movement of the
first invertase band, which is always much narrower in leaves than in
roots.  Thus the significance of the difference between leaf and root
first band position cannot be assessed until purified leaf fractions
have been run.  When gels were stained for glyco-protein no bands were
detectable in root extracts but leaves and a discrete band which again
occupied the same position as the first invertase band.<p>

We have fractionated leaves and roots from a number of Arabidopsis
races (seed kindly provided by Professor KRANZ) and have found further
evidence of differences in first band positions similar to those
already reported and between one and three components in the second
band position.  However, in order to undertake genetic analysis of
these differences it is necessary to increase the distances between
these components if, for example, intermediate bands are to be
detected. We are therefore experimenting with shallower gradients.  It
would also be of interest to look for charge differences between the
races, perhaps by isoelectric focussing on polyacrylamide gels.<p>

To further characterise the different molecular weight forms we have
carried out preparative fractionations of leaf and root extracts on
Sephadex G200.  In the experiments described here the extraction and
column buffers were identical to those used with the gradient gels in
order to obtain comparable results. Figure 1 shows the results
obtained from fractionation of a crude root extract on a 2.5 x 33 cm
column of G200 with I, II, and III referring to the three peaks of
activity on sucrose.  Peak I is eluted in the void volume (Vo) and
therefore has a molecular weight in excess of 3 x 10 5.  The major
peak of activity (II) has a prominent shoulder (III); both are
well-separated from the major peak of protein.  In previous G200
fractionations calibrated with protein standards the major peak of
activity eluted at the same volume as bovine serum albumin and had a
molecular weight of about 7 x 10 4.<p>

The trivial name, invertase, is applied to two types of enzyme which
hydrolyse sucrose; the *alpha* glucosidases and *beta*
fructofuranosidases. Crude extracts contain negligible amounts of
*alpha* glucosidase, but readily hydrolyse raffinose, a substrate for
*beta* fructofuranosidases (D'Souza, 1976).  Figure 1 shows that
activity on raffinose is also distributed in three peaks which
correspond to I, II, and III.  However, the rates of raffinose
hydrolysis, relative to sucrose, of the three peaks (Table 1) suggest
that peaks II and III may be distinguished on this basis.<p>

How do peaks I, II, and III relate to the first and second bands of
gradient gels?  Figure 2 shows a gel on which the three peaks were
fractionated and stained for activity on sucrose.  Peak I occupies the
first band position while II and III are in the second band position.
But close inspection of the gel reveals that III has a "tail" of
activity which is not well separated from the main band.  Of course
III, which is a shoulder of the major activity peak will be heavily
contaminated with II and might be expected to show two components on
gels.  It should be noted that these partially purified fractions
occupy positions identical to the bands obtained from crude root
extracts.<p>

In earlier experiments with gels we found that the first band of
activity was lost if the pH of substrate incubation was shifted from
5.4 to 4.7.  The ratios of activities on sucrose at the two pH's of
peaks I, II, and III are shown in Table 2.  Results are included for a
leaf extract fractionation, which also had a three peak elution
pattern, but in which II was a relatively minor component and III was
the major acivity peak.  It is not possible to say at this stage if II
and III from roots and leaves are identical or whether the differences
shown in Table 2 are significant.  However, it is clear that in both
tissues I differs from II and III in its response to pH.<p>

Further differences between I and II were found when their relative
affinities for sucrose were tested. From LINEWEAVER-BURK plots II had
a Km of 1.85 mM but a simple straight line relationship for I was not
found and the plot appeared to be biphasic. This suggests the presence
in I of at least two enzymes active on sucrose but with widely
different affinities for it.<p>

Summary<p>

The invertase activity of Arabidopsis roots and leaves occurs in high
and low molecular forms, which are *beta* fructofuranosidases and
which are distinguishable by a number of criteria. Each of these forms
may contain two (or more) components and there are differences in the
occurrence or activity of these components between tissues and races
of Arabidopsis.  Further, characterisation of the components and
genetic analysis of the races require refinement of the separation
procedures.<p>

A number of workers have reported the presence of multiple forms of
invertase in plants.  In some cases different molecular weight forms
have been described and their occurrence related to a particular
develpmental stage (e.g., JAYNES and NELSON, 1971; JONES and KAUFMAN,
1975).  However, the diversity of species, tissues and fractionation
methods employed makes useful comparisons very difficult. We believe
that this type of study will benefit considerably from the combined
biochemical and genetical analysis which is possible with Arabidopsis
now that we have some basic information on the occurrence of mulitple
forms of the enzyme in different tissues and races.<p>
