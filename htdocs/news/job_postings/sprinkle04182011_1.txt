iPlant Genotype to Phenotype Scientific Analyst

The iPlant Collaborative is a cyberinfrastructure collaborative, working to address grand 
challenges identified by the plant sciences community. The iPlant Collaborative seeks to 
develop a comprehensive national cyberinfrastructure which will unite researchers in 
every plant biology discipline--from those working at the microscopic level, such as 
molecular biologists, cellular biologists and geneticists, to those working on the 
ecosystem and planetary level.  iPlant works in partnership with computer scientists and 
engineers, information scientists, mathematicians and social scientists, in order to 
facilitate communication and collaboration across all of these disciplines to address 
questions of global importance and advance all of these fields. 

The iPlant Genotype to Phenotype (iPG2P) project (http://ipg2p.iplantcollaborative.org) is 
seeking an engagement team analyst (ETA). The ETA serves as a liaison between 
scientific working groups, the iPlant software development team and iPlant leadership. 
This involves active discussion with the scientists, research into appropriate 
bioinformatics tools and supporting technologies, and the judicious application of 
technical judgment to convert working group conversation into practical design 
requirements.

The primary responsibilities of the iPG2P Engagement Team Analyst include:
*	Translation of working group discussions into formal software requirements
*	Attending working group meetings and leading technical discussions
*	Working with scientific collaborators to identify needs, articulate priorities, and 
develop workflows and narratives
*	Tool research and evaluation, prototype software development and testing
*	Managing and reporting on project requirements, progress, and deliverables
*	Performing related duties as assigned by the iPG2P Scientific Lead and Project 
Manager
*	Being proactive in identifying opportunities and potential problems
*	Coordinating development across projects, facilitating integration and cross-
communication

REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS
*	Advanced degree (MS or Ph.D) in a life science discipline (biology, genetics, 
biochemistry, etc.). Candidates with a degree in another natural science, computer 
science, information technology or a related discipline will also be considered with 
a demonstrated track record of research experience in the life sciences;
*	2-3 years work experience conducting computational biology research and/or 
collaborative scientific software development (academic, government, or industry);
*	Interest in science and technology and ability to rapidly adapt to new technologies;
*	Excellent oral presentation and communications skills
*	Strong interpersonal skills and ability to build consensus
*	Advanced ability to work independently under established deadlines and as part of 
a team
*	Ability to travel as required to partner/collaborator institutions, relevant conferences, 
etc.

PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS
*	A research background in genomics, genetics, physiology, or molecular 
biochemistry
*	Experience in projects involving advanced computing and information technologies 
used in life science research in academia, government laboratories, and/or industry
*	Competence in at least two of the following: Perl, Python, C, C++, R, UNIX Shell, 
Java
*	Proven ability to promote and support the use of high-performance computing, 
visualization, networking, and massive data storage systems to scientists to 
expand their research impact.
