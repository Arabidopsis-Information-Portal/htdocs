INTRODUCTION<p>

Research into the specific effects of mutagens in higher plants
indicates that particular mutants are more frequently or even
exclusively obtained with a specific mutagen (Ehrenberg et al., 1959;
Gustafsson, 1963; McKelvie, 1963; Nilan et al., 1959) and mutagen
specificity of X-rays or *gamma*rays and fast neutrons for some
individual loci was revealed by genetic analysis of erectoides and
eceriferum mutants in barley (Lundquist, 1975; Lundquist et al., 1962;
Lundquist et al., 1968; Persson et al., 1969).<p>

Although Conger and Constantin (1974), Gaul (1964) and Nilan (1964)
showed that both experimental conditions and mutagen dose affected the
mutant spectrum, these factors have not usually been considered in
work on mutagen specificity.<p>

The present study about the effect of X-rays or fast neutrons on the
mutant spectrum in Arabidopsis was carried out to extend the data on
X-ray and fast neutron specificity and to study more closely the
effect of dose on mutant spectrum. Moreover, irradiation was applied
with or without a dithiothreitol (DTT) pretreatment.<p>

Fast neutrons induce relatively more chromosome breaks and less base
damage than X-rays (Ahnstrom, 1977, 1979; Hawkins, 1979). This could
possibly explain the difference in induced mutant spectrum. Since the
data recorded in the literature (Malvarez et al., 1965; Schans et al.,
1979) indicate that irradiation in the presence of -SH compounds
reduces the ratio standard breaks/base damage, the effect of DTT on
X-ray and fast neutron-induced mutant spectra could elucidate whether
the spcificity of radiation type is influenced by its relative
frequency of induced strand breaks.<p>

MATERIAL AND METHODS<p>

Plant material. Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. is a small, fast
growing, self-fertilizing crucifer. Seed stocks used in the experiment
were of the mutant erecta of the ecotype "Landsberg" (Redei, 1962).<p>

Pretreatment. To break dormancy, seeds were kept on moist filter paper
at 2*degrees*C for 5 days and redried (24*degrees*C, 24 hr). The
redried seeds were submerged in tapwater (=0% DTT) or DTT solution
(1.2% DTT), at 22*degrees*C, 3 hr before irradiation.<p>

Irradiation. X-ray exposures were 140, 233, 327 and 420 Gy (10 Gy = 1
krad) for seeds submerged in 22*degrees*C tapwater; and 280, 467, 653,
and 840 Gy were given to seeds submerged in 22*degrees*C DTT solution.
The irradiation was carried out with an MG 301 X-ray machine with an
MCN 420 tube, operating at 320 kVp and 10 mA, with an additional
filter of 0.25 Cu and 1.0 Al and with a dose rate of 4 Gy/min. Fast
neutrons (20, 33, 47 and 60 Gy to seeds submerged in 22*degrees*C 1.2%
DTT) were given in the irradiation room of the BARN (Biological
Agricultural Reactor Nederlands, Wageningen) with a dose rate 1
Gy/min. The *gamma*contamination was low, only approximately 3 percent
on Gy basis. The maximum duration of irradiation was 3.5 hr. In order
to have uniform environmental conditions, the seeds were submerged
during irradiation as well as before (3 hr pretreatment) and after.
From start to finish, the seeds were submerged for 6.5 hr at
22*degrees*C, and subsequently rinsed with tapwater (5min.) and sown.<p>

The treatments described above (18 including the controls, Table 1)
were done twice, with an interval of approximately one year. The X-ray
and fast neutron dose ranges applied, in the presence or absence of
DTT, induced approximately comparable levels of genetic damage, i.e.,
M 1-ovule sterility (Table 1), M 2-embryonic lethality, frequency of
chlorophylls and viable mutants (Dellaert, 1980).<p>

Culture medium and culture conditions. The seeds were sown (equally
spaced) in portions of 30 on a standard mineral medium in a petri dish
and put to germinate at 24*degrees*C under continuous illumination
using fluorescent light tubes, 8000 lux/cm 2. After 8 days the
seedlings were transplanted into soil in an air conditioned
greenhouse. The culture medium and culture conditions used were as
described by Feenstra (1964) and Oostindier-Braaksma and Feenstra
(1973).<p>

M 1-generation. In the M 1-generation Moller's embryo test (Moller,
1961, 1963) was applied to silique number 5 or 6 of the main
inflorescence for scoring M 1-ovule sterility, M 2-embryonic lethals
and chlorophylls (details of the results will be published elsewhere).
Since chimerism is progressively lost upwards along the stem (Balkema,
1971) and within flower chimerism does not occur frequently in
Arabidopsis (Dallaert, 1980; Ivanov, 1973), chimerism was in the
majority of cases avoided by harvesting a single silique from the top
of the main inflorescence per M 1-plant for progeny testing. Only well
filled siliques were harvested, in order to 1) increase the
germination frequency of the M 2-seeds, 2) increase the fertility in
the M 2-generation, and 3) decrease the number of deviant M 2-plants
caused by chromosomal aberrations, without reducing the mutant
frequency (Mesken et al., 1968; Moller, 1966). The percentage M
1-plants harvested are given in Table 1.<p>

Table 2: Classification of radiation-induced mutants in Arabidopsis
according to phenotype (the main groups of the classification system
of Burger (1971) and Kranz (1978), mutagen (X-rays versus fast
neutrons) and the conditions of the treatment (0% DTT versus 1.2%
DTT).<p>

M 2-generation. Viable mutants were scored in the M 2-generation by
testing the progenies of the harvested M 1-plants. Five to twelve
seeds were sown per M 1-progeny. Cold treatment (5 days at
2*degrees*C; to break dormancy) was given immediately after sowing.
The other culture conditions and the culture medium used, were as
described above.<p>

For establishing the fertility in the M 2-generation Moller's embryo
test was applied to silique number 5 or 6 of the main inflorescence of
one randomly selected plant per M 2-line.<p>

Mutant spectrum. Viable mutants in the M 2-generation were defined as
flowering plants showing deviations from the wild type in plant
morphology and/or leaf colour. A random sample from M 2-lines, which
segregated for viable mutants was harvested and progeny tested to
verify the mutant type. Based on the phenotype characteristics, the
viable mutants were classified into different groups per treatment
(Table 2). The mutant groups distinguished conform to the
classification system for morphological and seed colour mutants
described by Burger (1971) and Kranz (1978). In addition to this
classification system the following mutant phenotypes (Table 2) were
ditinguished:<p>

- Vital yellow-green mutants (phenotype group 1), in this group all
flowering chlorophyll deficient mutants were classified.<p>

- Mutants with more rosette leaves and late flowering, ones as
described by Hussein and Van der Veen (1965, 1968) (Phenotype group
6).<p>

- Mutants with hanging pods and short pod-stalks (phenotype group 12),
one mutant with this phenotype was described by Burger (1971), but she
did not classify this mutant in a separate group.<p>

- Mutants with a different flower morphology but not belonging to the
Flosculimut groups described by Burger (1971) and Kranz (1978), such
as the sterile "double-flowering" agamous, similar to the one describd
by Conrad (1971) (phenotype group 15).<p>

- Gibberellin-sensitive mutants (phenotype group 17), such as
described by Koornneef et al. (1977)<p>

To test the effect of the various treatments (radiation type and DTT
pretreatment) independently arisen mutants were classified according
to three factors, i.e., mutagen, M (X-rays versus fast neutrons), the
condition of the treatment, D (0% DTT versus 1.2% DTT), and the mutant
phenotype, P (Table 21). Mutants were considered to be independent
when they occurred in different M 1 progenies.<p>

The mutant frequency, m, per mutant group was expressed as the
mutation frequency per cell (Frydenberg, 1963; Gaul, 1957).<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

The effect of pre selection for "well filled" siliques in M 1 on the
relation M 1-versus M 2-percentage ovule sterility.<p>

Without selection for fertility in the M 1-generation a large part of
the radiation-induced M 1-sterility is transmitted to the M
2-generation (Gaul, 1963; Mesken et al., 1968; Moller, 1966). From the
data from Mesken and Van der Veen (1968) it was deduced that without
selection for fertility approximately 45 percent of X-ray induced M
1-ovule sterility in Arabidopsis was transmitted to the M
2-generation. In the present experiment, where only "well-filled"
siliques were harvested in the M 1-gneration for progeny testing, it
was calculated from the M 1- and M 2-ovule sterility data in Table 1,
that the relation between the sterility percentages in the two
generations can be algebraically described by:<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol18/vol18-pg23-fig0.gif">Click here for figure</a><p>

This means that approximately 12 percent of the M 1-ovule sterility
has been "transmitted" to the M 2-generation. This low percentage can
be ascribed to the effect of selection for "well-filled" siliques in
the M1. However, it should be noted that the effect of selection could
not be accurately measured, since no data were available from a direct
comparison (at the same time) of the induced M 1-sterility, M
2-sterility without, and M 2-sterility with pre selection for M
1-fertility.<p>

The effect of radiation type on induced mutant spectrum.<p>

Table 2 gives the number of independently arisen mutants, classified
to phenotype (P), mutagen (m) and conditions of the treatment (D). The
data from a three-way contingency table. To test whether or not the
observed mutant spectrum, i.e., the frequencies of the different
mutants, was influenced by the type of radiation (X-rays or fast
neutrons) and by the pretreatment with dithiothreitol (DTT) a G-test
for independence of the three variables (M, D, P) was used (SOKAL et
al., 1969). From Table 3 it can be seen that there was a significant
(p<0.005) association between mutagen and mutant phenotype (M x P).
This indicates that the mutant spectrum was significantly affected by
the radiation type, i.e., X-rays or fast neutrons, by which the
mutants were induced.<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol18/vol18-pg24-tab3.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

Table 3: Analysis of independence P x M x D*<p>

*Analysis of the data from Table 2; P = mutant phenotype group (17
categories, M = mutagen (X-rays or fat neutrons), D = condition of
treatment (0% DDT or 1.2% DTT)<p>

After close examination of the data (Table 2), it was possible to
group the 17 mutant phenotypes into three, namely: -P I, the phenotype
groups in which the number of fast neutron induced mutants was
approximately twice (or more) the number of X-ray-induced mutants,
i.e., the long hypocotyl mutants, loosely packed rosette leaf mutants,
roundish or broad leaf mutants, eceriferum mutants, mutants with
hanging pods and short pod stalks, mutants with a different flower
morphology, mutants with yellow seeds, and gibberellin-sensitive
mutants.<p>

- P II, the phenotype groups in which conversely the number of X-ray
induced mutants was approximately twice (or more) the number of fast
neutron induced mutants. These were only mutants with closely packed
broad leaves and short petioles, and<p>

-P III, the remaining mutant phenotypes.<p>

In none of the phenotype classes was a significant effect of radiation
type on mutant spectrum left. This independence was expected because
of the criteria used for grouping the mutant phenotypes. It can be
concluded that the significant G-value for the P x M association can
be attributed to the differential distribution of X-ray-compared to
fast neutron-induced mutants over the phenotype classes P I, P II, and
P III, respectively (Table 4).<p>

Table 5: Rank Test (White, 1952) for unpaired measurements after X-ray
and fast neutron irradiation.  A. the frequency of mutants with
closely packed broad leaves with short petioles/100 cells B. the
frequency of mutants with loosely packed leaves with long petioles/100
cells C. the frequency of mutants with roundish or broad leaves/100
cells D. the frequency of eceriferum mutants/100 cells E. the
frequency of (vital) yellow-green mutants/100 cells<p>

It is statistically unreliable to isolate individual lines from a
contingency table and ascribe significance to them. Therefore, to test
whether in the dose range studied, specific mutant phenotypes were
more frequently induced with either X-rays or fast neutrons,
rank-tests (White, 1952) were applied in which the mutant frequencies
of specific mutants at various X-ray doses were compared with the ones
obtained at various fast neutron doses. From these tests (Table 5) it
can be concluded that mutants with closely packed broad leaves and
short petioles were more frequently induced with X-rays (p<0,05),
while mutants with loosely packed leaves and long petioles, and
eceriferum mutants were significantly more frequently induced with
fast neutrons (p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively). For the remaining
mutant types of the phenotype class P I, i.e. mutants which were
relatively more frequently induced with fast neutrons, no significant
differences between the frequencies were found (see for instance the
frequencies of mutants with roundish or broad leaves in Table 5).
Between the frequencies of X-ray- and fast neutron-induced mutants
grouped into phenotype class P III (i.e. mutants which were observed
approximately as frequently after X-rays as after fast neutrons such
as the yellow-green mutants (Table 5), no significant differences were
found.<p>

The X-ray-induced mutant spectrum observed in the present study is in
agreement with the spectrum reported by McKelvie (1963) in
Arabidopsis, at least as far as similar mutant groups are concerned.
McKelvie found a significant higher frequency of mutants with roundish
or broad leaves after X-rays than after EMS treatment.<p>

The effect of dithiothreitol pre-treatment on induced mutant spectrum.<p>

From Table 3 it can be seen that there was no significant association
between mutant phenotype (P) and the DTT treatment (D). This suggests
that the observed mutant spectrum was independent of the DTT
pre-treatment. However, when the effect of DTT on the distribution of
the mutants over the phenotype classes P I, P II, and P III was
tested, a weakly significant association between the phenotype classes
and DTT was found (0.05<p<0.10; Table 4). As can be seen in Table 6,
the relative frequency of P I mutants, i.e., the mutants which were
more frequently induced with fast neutrons than with X-rays, is less
with a DTT pre-treatment than without. No association was found
between DTT and mutagens, this means that the DTT effect was the same
for both types of radiation.<p>

Since DTT protects against single as well as double strand-breaks
(Chapman et al., 1975) and does not affect the induced base damage
(Schans et al., 1979), the observed DTT effect indicates that the
ratio strand-breaks/base-damage is higher for P I mutants than for P
II and P III mutants.<p>

fast neutrons) and dithiothreitol treatment (0% or 1.2% DTT)<p>

The mutant frequency per mutant group.<p>

The study of the mutation rate of specific loci might elucidate to
what extent mutability is an intrinsic property of the gene or of the
organization of the whole genome. Apart from the effect of the
experimental conditions, it is found that the mutability of individual
loci within an organism may vary by several orders of magnitude
(Lundquist, 1975; Persson et al., 1969; Stadler, 1942; Westergaard,
1959;). This indicates that the intrinsic property of the gene and/or
the "location" of the gene on the chromosome affects its mutability.
It was noticed by LI and Redei (1969) that mutations for thiamine
auxotrophy occurred with the same frequency, i.e., 0.75 x 10 E-4 per
locus per genome, in Penicillium and in Arabidopsis, which shows that
homologous loci can have similar mutability. Unfortunately, very few
data are available for the comparison of mutation rates of specific
loci across phylogenetic boundaries (Li et al., 1969; Yonezawa, et
al., 1975).<p>

To relate the mutant frequencies observed in the present study to
those found on other experiments (with Arabidopsis or with other plant
species) the mutant frequency per mutant group per cell is given in
Table 7. From these values and from the number of loci per mutant
group, a rough estimate for the average mutation frequency per locus
per cell, i.e. 1 x 10E-3, in the present experiment was determined.
Thus, the mutation rate of the "loci" studied was higher than that of
the thiamine loci. This may be due to either different experimental
conditions (mutagen, dose) or to a different mutability per se.
However, it should be noticed that the estimated frequency of the
mutation rate per locus per genome by Li and Redei (1969) might be
underestimated due to the error annexed with their calculation method.
Apart from errors in estimating the genetic effective cell number per
M 1-plant progeny, their estimate is dependent on M 1-progeny size.
This is in contrast to Gaul's method (Frydenberg, 1963; Gaul, 1963;
Yonezawa et al., 1975) which was used in this study.<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol18/vol18-pg21-tab7.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

Table 7: The mutant frequency per mutant group in Arabidopsis after
X-ray or fast neutron irradiation, with or without 1.2% dithiothreitol
(DTT) pre-treatment.<p>

Apart from the effect of radiation type, the data in Table 7 do not
indicate a difference in the mutability of the loci per mutant group
per cell.<p>

It is calculated that in the dose range studied, 1 Gy fast neutrons
was generally equivalent to 7 Gy X-rays for the induction of mutants.
However, for the induction of mutants with loosely packed leaves and
long petioles and for eceriferium mutants, 1 Gy fast neutrons was
equivalent to 22 and 18 Gy X-rays, respectively, while for the
induction of mutants with closely packed broad leaves and short
petioles 1 Gy fast neutrons was equivalent to 1.6 Gy X-rays. In barley
it was found that 1 Gy fast neutron was equivalent to 46.1 Gy X-rays
for the induction of eceriferum mutants (Lundquist, 1975). Thus, fast
neutrons are more effective in barley than in Arabidopsis for the
induction of eceriferum mutants. This indictes that, at least for the
eceriferum loci in Arabidopsis and barley, 'homologous' loci have a
different mutability.<p>

In barley, significant mutagen specificity in the mutability of
individual eceriferum and erectoides loci of X-rays or Gamma-rays and
fast neutrons was observed (Lundquist, 1975, Lundquist et al., 1962,
1968; Persson et al., 1969). The number of mutants per locus per
radiation type in Arabidopsis are still too low to pronounce upon
mutagen specificity for individual loci.<p>

Conclusion<p>

The most significant effect observed in the present experiment was the
difference between X-ray- and fast neutron-induced mutant spectra. The
data are in agreement with the results found in barley and show that
the difference in spectra is consistent over dose. It is found that
fast neutrons are more efficient for the induction of specific
mutants, i.e., the ones belonging to class P I. The fact that the
relative frequency of P I mutants was less with a DTT pre-treatment
than without, irrespective of radiation type by which the mutants were
induced, suggests that P I mutants more often originate from
strand-break damage than the P II and P III mutants. Therefore, the
data indicate that the difference between X-ray and fast
neutron-induced mutant spectra is caused by the relatively higher
frequency of breaks after fast neutrons than after X-rays. In this
respect it is worth mentioning that Schubert and Rieger (1976) found
differences between segmental response of chromosones I and V in Vicia
faba for the induction of aberrations by X-rays and fast neutrons.
This indicates that certain parts of the chromosomes have a better
ability to 'repair' induced strand-breaks than others. This specific
'repair' ability might be the basis for differences between X-ray and
fast neutron-induced mutant spectra.<p>

SUMMARY<p>

Arabidopsis Seeds were irradiated with X-rays or fast neutrons, in the
presence or absence of dithiothreitol. Well-filled siliques were
selected in the M 1-generation, resulting in a good M 2-fertility. In
the M 2-generation, where specific mutants were used as parameter, a
significant differentc (p<0.005) was found between X-ray and fast
neutron-induced mutant spectra. X-rays, for instance, induced more
mutants with closely packed broad leaves with short petioles, while
fast neutrons induced more mtuants with loosely packed leaes iwth long
petioles as well as more eceriferum mutants. This difference between
the mutability of certain characters by X-rays and fast neutrons was
consistent ovr several doses.<p>

The -SH radioprotector dithiothreitol did not significantly influence
the mutant spectra observed. However, certain mutant types, notably
those more frequently induced by fast neutrons, seem to be less
frequent after irradiation in the presence of DTT.<p>
