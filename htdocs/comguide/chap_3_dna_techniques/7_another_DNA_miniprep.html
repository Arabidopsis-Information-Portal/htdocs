PLANT DNA MINI-PREP

Tom Tai & Doug Dahlbeck, modified from Tai & Tanksley
(Tai, T. & Tanksley, S. 1991, Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 8, 297-303.)
*  The larger scale version of this mini-prep (given at the end), is currently 
the DNA isolation protocol of choice in the Dean lab.

1.  SOLUTIONS
  (i) EXTRACTION BUFFER 10 ml-1 600 ml-1
100mM Tris-HC, pH 8 1 ml 1M 60 ml 1M
50mM EDTA, pH 8 1 ml 0.5M 60 ml 0.5M
500mM NaCI 1 ml 5M 60 ml 5M
1.25% SDS (w/v) 1.25 ml 10% 75 ml 10%
8.3 mN NaOH 83 ul 1N (8.3 of 10N) 0.5 ml 10N
0.38% Na bisulphite 38 mg 2.28 g

  (ii) T5E
50 mM Tris, pH 8
10 mM EDTA, pH 8

  (iii) 5 M POTASSIUM ACETATE

2.  PROCEDURE
  (i) Collect leaf tissue (up to 0.15 g) in an Eppendorf tube.  Freeze by 
dipping in liquid N2 to fill tube.  Process in sets of about six tubes: fill all
tubes with liquid nitrogen, grind them all and proceed to step 2 before starting
another set.  Alternatively, can allow liquid N2 to evaporate and then store
samples at -70oC for later use. 
 *  To grind the tissue, we use disposable Kontes pellet pestles, which 
are available from VWR  (we re-use the pestles).  This works best if the 
tissue is harvested and frozen in 2.0 ml  microcentrifuge tubes.
 *  Leaf tissue can also be dried overnight in a 45oC forced air oven, 
stored dry at r.t., and then  powdered prior to step 2.

  (ii) Add 0.7 ml of extraction buffer that is preheated to 65oC and mix 
thoroughly using a toothpick or pipette tip.  Put in 65oC water bath for 
10 min.
  (iii) Add 0.22 ml 5M potassium acetate, mix well and put on ice for 20 to 
40 min.
  (iv) Pellet at 4oC for 3 min.
  (v)  Filter supernatant.  Pour into blue tip that has a small Kimwipe
"filter", force liquid into another Eppendorf tube using Pipetman.  Add 0.7 vol.
(0.4 ml?) of IPA and mix well. 
  (vi) Pellet at 4oC for 3 min, pour out supernatant, and rinse pellet twice 
with 70% ETOH.  Drain (on test tube rack or paper towel) for 1 min.
  (vii) Add 300 ul T5E, vortex 2 sec, into 65oC 5 min, vortex 2 sec (be 
sure pellet resuspends).
  (viii)  Add 150 ul 7.4M NH4OAc, vortex 2 sec and pellet 3 min.
  (ix) Transfer into a new 1.5 ml tube, add 330 ul IPA and mix well.
  (x) Pellet 3 min, pour out supernatant, rinse pellet twice with 70% 
ETOH, and drain inverted for 2 min.
  (xi) Add 100 ul T5E, vortex 2 sec, heat 65oC for 5 min, and vortex 2 
sec.
  (xii) Add 10 ul 3M NaOAc, mix, add 75 ul IPA, and mix well.
  (xiii)  Pellet 3 min, pour out supernatant, rinse pellet twice with 70% 
ETOH, and drain inverted for 2 min.
  (xiv) Dry pellet in Speedvac for 15 min, add 25 ul of TE and let pellet 
resuspend overnight at 4oC.
  (xv) Vortex 2 sec, heat 65oC 5 min and vortex 2 sec.  Store at 4oC.
 *  Storing at -20oC is better idea for longer periods.  Scale-ups of this 
(for 50 ml tubes, etc.)  also work fine.

3.  MACRO-PREP
  (i) Collect plant material (3-5 g) and freeze in liquid N2.
  (ii) Grind to a powder using a mortar and pestle.
  (iii) Transfer ground material into orange cap 50 ml tube and add 23 ml 
of extraction buffer that is preheated to 65oC and mix thoroughly.  Put in 
65oC water bath for 15 min.
  (iv) Add 7.1 ml 5M potassium acetate, mix well and put on ice for at least 
20 min.
  (v) Pellet at 4oC at 3,000 rpm for 15 min.
  (vi) Filter supernatant through a Miracloth square into a clean 50ml 
orange-capped tube.
  (vii) Add 19 ml of isopropanol and mix gently but thoroughly, leave 
approx. 1hr (-20oC) or o/n (-20oC).
  (viii) Pellet at 4oC at 3,000 rpm for 30 min, pour out supernatant, and 
rinse pellet twice with 70% ETOH.  Drain (on test tube rack or paper 
towel) for 1 min.
  (ix) Dissolve pellet in 0.72 ml T5E.  Vortex 10 sec twice.  Leave 30-60 
min.
  (x)  Add 0.48 ml 7.4M NH4OAc and vortex 10 secs.
  (xi)  Pellet in minifuge for 5 mins.  Pour supernatant into a 2 ml 
Eppendorf and add 0.73 ml of isopropanol, mix well by inversion.
  (xii) Pellet DNA by spinning for 10 mins in minifuge.  Rinse pellet twice 
with 1ml 70% ethanol.  Pellet may be left o/n in ethanol at this point.  
After last wash, drain inverted on a paper towel.
  (xiii) Add 1ml T5E and vortex for 10 sec.  Heat at 65oC for 5 min.  Add 
0.1 ml 3M NaOAc.
  (xiv) Precipitate DNA with 0.73ml of isopropanol and mix well by 
inversion.
  (xv) Spin down for 5 mins.  Wash twice in 1ml 70% ethanol. 
  (xvi) Dry pellet under vacuum.  Resuspend in 300ml TE o/n at 4oC.
  (xvii) Vortex 10 sec.  Heat at 65oC for 5 min. Freeze.
