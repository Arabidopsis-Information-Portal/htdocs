The Department of Genetics Development and Cell Biology seeks candidates who leverage interdisciplinary 
approaches, both experimental and computational, to interrogate or manipulate biological networks that 
mediate important cellular and developmental processes. This includes but is not limited to systems 
scale metabolomics, proteomics, transcriptomics and/or phenomics approaches to understand networks that 
mediate important cellular and developmental processes. Successful candidates will establish vibrant, 
extramurally funded programs of research, will demonstrate an ability to work collaboratively within 
existing research strengths at ISU, and will contribute to undergraduate courses and to graduate courses 
in their area(s) of expertise through scholarly teaching. For more information, see:
