Bioinformatics postdoc position to study transcriptional regulatory networks in Arabidopsis

A bioinformatics postdoctoral position is available immediately in the laboratory of Dr. Sue Rhee at the Carnegie 
Institution, Department of Plant Biology (Stanford, CA), to create and analyze transcriptional regulatory network 
models of environmental stress response in Arabidopsis.

The successful candidate will be responsible for carrying out bioinformatic analyses of microarray and other 
functional genomics data to create, analyze, and test models of transcriptional regulatory networks.

Qualified candidates must have a Ph.D. or equivalent in Biology, Mathematics, Computer Science, Engineering or
 related field, a strong background in using statistics, modeling and programming, and strong communication skills.

Please email a brief letter describing your research experience, plus your CV and contact information for 3 
references to Dr. Sue Rhee at rhee@acoma.stanford.edu.
