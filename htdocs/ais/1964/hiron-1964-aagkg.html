Vol 01:<h2>HIRONO, Y.</h2><h2>A genetic method for localization of chromosome defects</h2>

The distance between a marker and a chromosomal defect which affects
the transmission of the involved strand can be estimated on the basis
of the observed phenotypic ratio and the inherent transmission of the
defect.  If two markers are used the defect can be located and its
extent may be determined.  The transmission of defect may be different
in the two gametophytes and homozygous condition may involve
lethality.<p>

Formulas have been constructed for F2, based on the principle of
maximum likelihood, in order to make possible the estimation of
linkage intensities for such defect factors.  The recovery and the
lethality of the homozygotes have been considered both in coupling and
repulsion phase for defect and markers concerned. Charts have been
constructed which facilitate the estimation.  If any two of the three
variables (transmission, phenotypic ratio, map distance) is known the
third can be directly read.  Using the phenotypic ratio of the two
known marker genes, with a new mathematical formula the map of defect
and markers can be constructed without direct laborious transmission
tests.<p>
