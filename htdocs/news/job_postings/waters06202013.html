<p>The Department of Agronomy and Horticulture at the University of Nebraska
    - Lincoln invites applications for a postdoctoral position focusing on
    mechanisms of plant adaptive responses to low iron conditions. This is a
    12-month, non-tenure leading position established for a period of one year.
    &nbsp;Continuation beyond one year is dependent upon satisfactory
    performance and funding availability, with initial funding available for 2
    years.</p>
<p>Previous work (e.g. Waters et al., 2012, J.Exp.Bot. 63: 5903-5918) has
    indicated that iron deficient plants accumulate additional copper to
    facilitate a switch from iron containing proteins to copper containing
    proteins. This research will focus on the mechanisms of this switch and the
    molecular players involved in Arabidopsis thaliana. The research will use a
    combination of genetic, molecular, biochemical and genomic approaches to
    investigate global gene expression and regulation of specific genes and
    microRNAs by iron and copper status. In part, the postdoctoral researcher
    will construct promoter:GFP fusions, perform DNA introductions, oversee
    transformation and analyze transgenic plants.</p>
<p>We seek creative, highly motivated candidates with a strong interest in
    plant biology. Applicants must have a Ph.D. with a strong background and
    publications in plant biology, biochemistry, molecular biology, plant
    genetics, or a closely related field. Experience with transcriptomics, QTL
    mapping, plant transformation, molecular cloning, and real-time RT-PCR are
    desired.</p>
<p>Demonstrated oral and written communication skills and the ability to
    work independently and with a team of researchers is expected. The
    successful candidate will disseminate research results at scientific
    meetings and in journals, write progress reports, and supervise and support
    undergraduate and graduate students.</p>
<p>
    Applicants should email a cover letter, CV and contact information for three
    references to Dr. Brian Waters at <a href='mailto:bwaters2@unl.edu'>bwaters2@unl.edu</a>.
