Research Associate Position
There is a Research Associate position available at the Plant Biotechnology Institute, Saskatoon, Canada in 
the laboratory of Adrian Cutler. The project is directed toward improving abiotic stress tolerance in 
crucifers. The project will involve production and assessment of transgenics as well as functional 
characterization of new stress-related genes. Initial work on new genes will be in Arabidopsis, whereas 
known and successful approaches will be implemented in B. napus. Applicants should be interested in 
functional analysis of genes derived from our previous Arabidopsis stress projects. We have several 
interesting genes that have been analyzed to varying levels and for which there will be lots of scope for 
innovative work.
Applicants should have received a PhD within the last 5 years and be able to easily perform standard plant 
molecular biology techniques (cloning, PCR, plant transformation and selection etc). Additional 
experience and interest in genomics and bioinformatics would be useful. Further details about the 
project, the Research Associate program and the Cutler lab can be found 
athttp://cbr.pbi.nrc.ca/abscisicacid/jobs.html. Interested applicants should send their CVs 
toAdrian.cutler@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca.
