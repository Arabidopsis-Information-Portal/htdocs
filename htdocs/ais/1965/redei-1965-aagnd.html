It was reported (LANGRIDGE 1958) that mutant 1018/6 is completely
restored by thiamine, and the pyrimidine and the thiazole moieties of
the vitamin are ineffective.  Recent biochemical studies indicate that
the synthesis of thiamine from the specific pyrimidine and the
specific thiazole involves several steps (cf. BROWN and REYNOLDS
1963).  Thiazole is phosphorylated before it is coupled to pyrimidine.
Though LANGRIDGE's mutant responds best to thiamine,
4-methyl-5-beta-hydroxyethyl thiazole alone is also beneficial.  It
appears therefore that the mutation affects an intermediate step
between thiazole synthesis and the coupling of thiazole-monophosphate
to pyrimidine-pyrophosphate.  The expression of 1018/6 is quite
variable; the results of two experiments were the following:<p>
