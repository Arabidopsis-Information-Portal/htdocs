ABSTRACT<p>

Circulifer tenellus, inoculative for the beet leafhopper transmitted
virescence agent (BLTVA), were fed on young Arabidopsis thaliana
ecotype La-O. After a period of five weeks, the plants developed
disease symptoms including virescence, phyllody and the proliferation
of flowers. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of
mycoplasma-like bodies in the phloem of symptomatic plants. A.
thaliana has been demonstrated to be a host of BLTVA, a plant
pathogenic mycoplasma-like organism.<p>

INTRODUCTION<p>

The mycoplasma-like organisms (MLOs) are a unique and intractable
group of plant pathogens. They cause economically important diseases
in a broad range of annual and perennial host plants. All efforts at
charatcterization have been frustated by the inability of researchers
to culture MLOs axenically. Of necessity, therefore, research on these
agents has been conducted in either the host plants in which they
cause disease or in the vector insects (usually leafhoppers) which
transmit them. In practice, this has meant that normally trivial
procedures such as the inoculation of plants with the pathogen, the
preservation of voucher specimens and the comparison of related agents
pose challenging technical difficulties (McCoy, 1989). Latent period
of weeks to months are required for the organisms in both their plant
and insect hosts. Detection techniques are often laborious to perform,
requiring time-consuming bioassays or electron microscopy, although in
recent years promising molecular detection techniques have been
developed for some MLOs (Kirkpatrick et al., 1987; Lin and Chen,
1985). While graft transmission of the agents between related plants
is possible, insect transmissibility is quickly lost when MLOs are
maintained by grafting. Therefore, research on these pathogens in a
transmissible form requires the maintenance of an elaborate biosystem
which includes leafhoppers, plants and the MLOs.<p>

In addition to their importance in causing damage to crop plants, MLOs
are of interest because of their profound effects on morphology and
physiology of their hosts. One group of MLOs, referred to as the
virescence agents, cause a wide range of symptoms which include
phyllody (leaf-like flower petals), virescence (greening of normally
pigmented floral organs), proliferation (the development of shoots or
flowers from adventitious meristems), stunting, stem elongation and
seed sterility. Many of these host symptoms are similar to the
responses that might be elicited by the exogenous application of plant
growth substances.<p>

One MLO, the beet leafhopper transmitted virescence agent (BLTVA), has
been demonstrated to induce flowering in plants grown under
environmental conditions which do not permit non-inoculated control
plants to flower (Golino, 1988). The nature of this host induction
response (HIR) remains to be determined. Plant growth substances are
very likely involved. It is conceivable that this MLO contains genes
which affect the expression of host plant hormone metabolism or,
possibly, is a source of prokaryotic genes for synthesis of GAs. It is
unfortunate that this organism has not as yet been cultured
axenically, since this would allow use of the techniques of molecular
biology to determine the mechanism of the HIR.<p>

Barring the discovery of techniques for axenic culture of MLOs,
further studies of MLO-induced HIR could be greatly facilitated by use
of a host plant for which well characterized physiological mutants are
available. Arabidopsis thaliana, the "botanical Drosophila" (Kranz,
1987), could serve as an excellent model system for these studies,
provided it could be infected with BLTVA. To our knowledge,
Arabidopsis thaliana has not been shown to be a host of any MLO (McCoy
et al., 1989). In order to study the nature of BLTVA-induced
morphological and physiological changes in A. thaliana, we selected
the ecotype La-O (Kranz and Kirchheim, 1987), for which
well-characterized GA mutants are available (Koornneef, 1978).<p>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<p>

Wild type A. thaliana, ecotype La-O, was kindly provided by Dr. M.
Koornneef of the Agricultural University, Wageningen, The Netherlands.
Seed was sown in a suspension of agar upon a light, well-drained
potting mix. Flats of seedlings were grown at 21 <*degrees*C with 8 hr
days in a growth chamber. Plants were inoculated at about 4 weeks,
when they had begun to flower. Before inoculation each plant was
pinched back to facilitate covering with a cage.<p>

A line of BLTVA, FC-83-13, was chosen for inoculation because it is
known to induce the HIR in a wide range of host plants (Golino, 1988).
BLTVA was transmitted through the progeny of a beet leafhopper,
Circulifer tenellus (Baker), which was collected in the spring of 1983
from an infected periwinkle, Catharanthus roseius (L.) G.Don. It has
since been maintained in our greenhouse by procedures described
previously (Golino, 1987).<p>

For these experiments, C. tenellus plants were covered with small
cages and 5 inoculative adult leafhoppers placed on each of sixteen
plants; 15 control plants were grown under identical conditions
without leafhoppers. After one week of leafhopper feeding, a
sufficient period of time to transmit BLTVA, both test and controls
plants were fumigated with DDVP (2,2-dichlorovinyl dimethyl phosphate)
to destroy the leafhoppers and the cages were removed. The plants were
then returned to the growth chamber and observed for the development
of symptoms.<p>

After seven weeks, tissue was taken from plants with typical symptoms
of BLTVA infection and prepared for electron microscopy. Small pieces
of the main stem and pedicles were fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde in
phosphate buffer overnight then placed in 2% osmium tetroxide for 1
hour. The tissue was then dehydrated in a standard ethanol series and
imbedded in Spurr's media, Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA, 18976,
USA (Spurr, 1969). Samples were sectioned on a Reichert ultramicrotome
OM 113, poststained with saturated uranyl acetate in 100% methanol,
and examined on a Zeiss Em9 electron microscope.<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

Some four weeks after inoculation both infected and control plants
produced white flowers, followed by full siliques and seed. In the
fifth week, flower buds on a few of the inoculated plants failed to
develop normal color. Instead, the green flower buds expanded to a
larger than normal size and, when they opened, the flowers had typical
symptoms of BLTVA infection including virescence and phyllody (Figure
1). By several seeks postinoculation, seven of the test plants had
developed BLTVA symptoms. Tissue was taken at this time for fixation,
thin sectioning and electron microscopic examination.<p>

The visualization of mycoplasm-like bodies, cells 200 to 1,000 nm in
diameter bound by a single unit membrane and lacking a cell wall, in
the phloem of symptomatic plants is a reliable diagnostic tool for the
determination of MLO infection (McCoy, 1989). As seen in Figure 2, the
infection of A. thaliana by the MLO BLTVA was verified by observations
using a transmission electron microscope. MLOs can be seen packed in
both phloem cells in this cross section; the organelles in the
neighboring cell are a helpful visual reference for scale.<p>

phloem cells in the center of the photo verify that the plants are
infected with a mycoplasma-like organism. (Magnification: 6333x)<p>

As the disease progressed, all but 2 of the initial 16 inoculated
plants developed symptoms of infection. This 87% infection rate is
similar to the rates of infection in other hosts. In addition to the
floral symptoms noted above, a proliferation of secondary flowers was
observed; the pistil of infected flowers enlarged and grew as a stem
producing virescent flowers as it developed. Stem elongation within
these distorted floral organs was also noted. No normal development of
petals, stamens, pistils or seed was seen on individual plants after
the first onset of symptoms.<p>

Little is understood about the host induction response, the induction
of flowering in certain plants infected by BLTVA. The discovery that
A. thaliana can be infected with BLTVA opens the possiblity that in
future studies we will be able to use Arabidopsis as a model system to
elucidate the mechanism of this unsuual plant-microbe interaction.<p>
