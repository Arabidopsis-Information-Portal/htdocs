  We have three PhD positions open for next September in our group at 
  Oxford Brookes University. They come with a bursary of £13,000 which 
  is a good deal considering the value of the pound, and fees are paid 
  by the University.  Please could you bring them to the attention of 
  any of your students who may be interested. 
 
  Our group is Plant Cell Biology:
