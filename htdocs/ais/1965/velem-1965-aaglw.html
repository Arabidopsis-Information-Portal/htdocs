Vol 01S: <h2>Chlorophyll Formation and Fine Structure of Chloroplasts in a Chlorina Mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana</h2><p>

J. VELEMINSKY and G. ROBBELEN<p>

The object of this investigation was a viable chlorina mutant (ch3) of
Arabidopsis thaliana, which segregates monohybrid recessive.  Its
leaves are characterized by a uniform yellow-green colour except the
young apical leaves just before flowering, which are rather normal
green. Growing older, the latter, however, also turn their colour back
to the typical yellow-green.<p>

In electron microscopical studies of this mutant ROBBELEN and
WEHRMEYER 1965) established three types of plastids with reference to
their membrane structure (Figure 1).<p>

right) in palisade cells of the mutant ch3.<p>

Type I was marked by extended smooth thylakoids with little or no
duplications. In chloroplast type II highly complicated and unusual
membrane differentiations are produced by combined e- and invagination
processes. The chloroplasts of type III finally reach a fairly normal
development with manyfold stacking membrane layers.<p>

In the course of some pigment analyses our attentio nwas drawn to the
fact that the amount of chlorophyll b in this mutant is relatively
small under certain conditions. This observation stimulated the
following sudies: 1) a detailed investigation of the processs involved
in the variability of the relative chlorophyll b content as measured
by the a/b ratio under various external conditions, and 2) an attempt
to correlate this pigment characteristics with the deviating structue
of plastids just mentioned.<p>

The method for the pigment analyses was thin-layer chromatography
after HAGER and BERTENRATH (1962). The quantity of the separated
pigments was determined spectrophotometrically employing the Zeiss
microcuvettes with an effective length equal to 5 cm. For these
analyses as well as for the parallel electron microscopical
preparations plants grown in the grenhouses on soil or in sterile test
tubes on agar in a growth chamber were used.<p>

The results characterizing the variability of the mutant under
greenhouse conditions during the winter season are summarized in Table
1.<p>

Table 1: Chlorophyll a/b ratios in the mutants ch3 and green control
plants respect., growing under greenhouse conditions during the winter
season (October 1964 - March 1965).<p>

In younger up to three month old plants having yellow-green leaves,
the a/b-ratio fluctuates between 6 and 12. In older rosettes before
flowering the young newly developing leaves happen to be green,
showing an a/b-ratio of 3, which is identical with that in the normal
green plants. With the forementioned enlightening of these leaves
towards yellow-green the a/b-ratio increases up to more than 6.<p>

To establish some external conditions, which might be equally
effective on the a/b-ratio, the mutant was grown under various day-
lengths, light qualities and intensities as well as with sucrose
feeding. Only day-length and light quality treatments in some cases
gave an obvious decrease of the initial a/b-ratio. For instance in one
experiment with three months old rosettes, the initial a/b-ratio of
adult leaves was about 9.9. After one month of continuous light the
a/b- ratio reached 3.4, that means, it was nearly normalized.<p>

Comparing these changes of the a/b-ratio with those in the absolute
amount of both chlorophyulls, two different processes leading to the
normal a/b-ratio of about 3 could be discerned: 1) normalization by a
preferential decrease of the chlorophyll a content and 2)
normalization by an increase of chlorophyll synthesis in total with a
relative advantage of the chlorophyll b. This can be illustrated by
the effect of an 8 hs and a 24 hs day-length rspectively on mutant
seedlings which both lead to a rather good normalization of the
a/b-ratio.<p>

the mutant ch3 under an 8 hs and 24 hs day light.<p>

In the 8 hs day, however, the chlorophyll b content remained constant,
while chlorophyll a decreased. On the other hand, under continuous
illumination the content of both chlorophylls increased, but the rise
of chlorophyll b was relatively higher. The first kind of
normalization by a dominating decrease of chlorophyll a was also
observed in the bleached ground-leaves of older rosettes growing in
agar-culture. The same appeared during the fading of the initially
green apical young leaves of older rosettes at flowering. Obviously
this process is comparable to the bleaching of autumn leaves of
descidious trees and of some aurea-mutants known in the literature
(cf. WOLF, 1956; SAGROMSKY, 1956).<p>

The second kind of normalization of the a/b-ratio by a relatively
higher increase of the chlorophyll b content, constantly occurred at
culture of the mutant under continuous illumination. The same
alteration has been previously found in the so-called "Weisherz" -
mutant of Oenothera by SCHOTZ (1962). This change can be interpreted
on the background of the well-known fact that a certain amount of
chlorophyll a must be present until the normal rate of chlorophyll b
synthesis is reached (e.g., VIRGIN, 1955). It should, however, be
pointed out that most of the chlorophyll mutants described in the
literature, are reported to bleach under high light intensities, while
this did not happen to such an extent in our chlorina mutant. Here a
decrease of the total chloropnyll content occurred under an 8 hs day,
whereas 24 hs illumination led to an appreciable increase.<p>

In the electron microscopical fine structure analyses of the mutant
chloroplasts the question was raised, whether the inhibition of
membrane diferentiation and of chlorophyll b synthesis are correlated.
It was established that a normalization of the a/b-ratio by the way of
a decrease of the pigment content runs parallel with a desruction of
thylakoids and an accumulation of lipid globule. This was especially
obvious in mutant plants grown in agar-culture: Their yellow-green
leaves had an a/b ratio of 7.9 and plastids with smooth long
thylakoids without duplications (type 1). The older leaves of the same
plant which were creme had an a/b-ratio of 3.2 a total amount of
chlorophylls of about 50% of the earlier one and plastids with globuli
and some residues of thylakoids. Finally the oldest, white leaves
showed a similar, nearly normal a/b-ratio, a total amount of about 25%
of that in yellow-green leaves and plastids with many globuli and
large vacuoles only. --As an example for the second kind of
normalization by a preferential increase of chlorophyll b synthesis,
the results of cultures under blue, red and far-red light can be
quoted. Under blue light the total chlorophyll content of 117 -/g
fresh-weight with an a/b- ratio of 5.2 was associated with a
chloroplast of typ I to II, while under far-red light the total was
163 -/g and the ratio 3.2 with a chloroplast typ III. The question,
however, remains, whether the change in the chloroplast structure is
to be attributed to the change of the a/b-ratio or to the different
total chlorophyll amount. To clarify this point the following tables
summarize our pigment analyses of plants grown under the various
growth conditions tested in comparison to the established
ultrastructure of the chloroplasts. In Table 2, in which plants with
similar a/b-ratios but different total amounts are compared, different
types of plastid structure are exhibited in plants with the same
a/b-ratio. On the other hand (Table 3) comparing plants with different
a/b-ratios but a similar total chlorophyll amount, no or only slight
differences in plastid type could be seen. Therefore it should be
concluded, that the development of the chloroplast structure in our
chlorina mutant is not dependent on the variations of the chlorophyll
b content, but only on the total amount of both chlorophylls. This
could be excellently confirmed in the viable mutant ch1, kindly
supplied by Dr. REDEI, which showed nearly normal membrane stacking in
chloroplasts, though not any chlorophyll b could be detected. (The
correspondent amount of chlorophyll a was 363.7 -/g f.w.<p>

Discussion:<p>

REDEI: Is there any difference between my allelic mutants ch1 and ch2
in the electron microscope?<p>

VELEMINSKY: At the cotyledon stage they were slightly different.  The
membrane formation was nearly the same but the number of stacking
grana thylakoids wa reduced in ch1 more than in ch2.<p>

REDEI: I always suspected these to be some structural mutants in the
sense that the chloroplast structure should be changed. This is
apparently not the case. - You mentioned the effect of blue and
far-red.  Was this only a qualitative or a quantitative result? Did
you measure the energy?<p>

VELEMINSKY: We tested the quality of our illumination fields by the
biological test, e.g., the stimulation of germination by red light and
its inhibition by far-red on Lactuca and Arabidopsis seeds.  Our far-
red completely inhibited the germination of both species, when the
far- red illumination was 6 times longer than the red one.
Quantitative energy measurements, however, have not yet been done.<p>

REDEI: Do you have any idea what should be the pathway of chlorophyll
biosynthesis? Are there immediate precursors? In literature you find
generally that chlorophyll a is the precursor of chlorophyll b.  Many
years ago it had been reported, that there is a protochlorophyll b.
Did you make any attempt to analyse this?  Actually this chlorophyll
b- less mutant would be of interest in this respect.<p>

ROBBELEN: No, we didn't do this up to now. I think the
protochlorophyll b in literature is rather dead. On the other hand
until two months ago, before I saw your mutant as well as that of Dr.
Muller, Bonn, in pea, I was not quite sure, whether an entirely
chlorophyll b- less mutant could be vital at all!<p>

VELEMINSKY: It is possible to state that there must be some connection
between the synthesis of chlorophyll b and a respectively.  This is
known from VIRGIN and some other authors, who tested the change of the
chlorophyll amount during the greening process of etiolated seedlings
and found firstly a formation of chlorophyll a and only when a certain
amount of chlorophyll a was accumulated, the normal chlorophyll b
synthesis started. Our mutant may be similar to this.<p>

REDEI: This, of course, is only circumstantial.<p>

BROWN: What about the function of chlorophyll b? There are some
indications that the enzymes of oxygen production in photosynthesis
are associated more specifically with chlorophyll b (cf I. TAGAWA, H.
Y.  TSUKIMOTO and D. I. ARNON: Proc. nat. Acad. Sci.  Wash. 49,
544-549, 1963). If there are plants which don't have chlorophyll b it
would be interesting to compare the rates of photosynthetic oxygen
production and photosynthetic ATP production and contrast with that of
normal plants.  Do you have any data on photosynthetic oxygen
production and photosynthetic phosphorylation rates in these mutants?<p>

VELEMINSKY: No, we have not, But it is known from the work of HIGHKIN
and FRENKEL (Plant Pysiol. 37, 814, 1962) that the photosynthetic
activity measured on the basis of gas exchange was the same in a
barely mutant lacking chlorophyll b as in the normal green type. The
content of sucrose and the growth rate, however, were lower in the
mutant. May be that starch formation is also inhibited, as assumed by
SEYBOLD (Sitzingsber. Heidelberger Akad. Wiss. 1940).<p>

SCHON: If one keeps in mind that the biosynthesis of starch is
performed by transference of "activated glucose" (UDPG + acceptor --
amylose + UDP) this postulated role of chlorophyll b in starch
production seems to be somewhat curious. On the other side it has been
very often supposed that chlorophyll b has something to do with
photosynthetic oxygen production. Recently D. C. Fork (Carnegie Inst.
Wash. Yearbook 61, 334, 1962) from FRENCH's laboratory investigated
the endogenous evolution of O2. It apparently results largely from the
functioning of chlorophyll b, since peaks at 650 and 480 nm were
measured in the action spectrum for the 01-production spike using
chloroplasts without an added HILL oxidant.<p>
