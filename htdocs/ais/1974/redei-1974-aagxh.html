We have reported earlier (CHUNG and REDEI 1973) tht the level of
orotidylic acid decarboxylase (4. 1. 1. 23) level is elevated in the
im 1 mutant.  Subsequent experiments showed an increased activity also
of the preceding enzyme, orotidylic acid pyrophosphorylase (2.4.2.10).<p>

Table 1: Activities of three enzymes on protein basis.<p>

Though azauracil increased the level of decarboxylase even further,
the activity of pyrophosphorylase was substantially reduced on the
analog medium. Acid phosphatase was used as a control emzyme. This
reduction created an effective bottleneck in the pyrimidine pathway. A
slight reduction in total RNA was detectable in the mutant compared to
the wild type control.  In 6-azauracil grown plants there was a higher
primidine: purine ratio in the RNA.  Though 6-azauracil-C14 was
incorporated into the RNA in a small yet detectable amount, the major
consequences of azauracil feeding could be found in the inhibition and
supprssion of the pyrimidine pathway.  6-azauracil-C14 was readily
converted into 6-azauridylic acid in the plant.  In the plants grown
on azauracil media, orotic acid-C14 was converted to nucleic acids
with an efficiency reduced to 1/7-1/8 of that found in its absence.
Plants grown without azauracil readily metabolized orotic acid-C14
into orotidine-5-monophosphate and uridine-5-monophosphate.  While
those plants which were raised on azauracil media, accumulated in
their cell the orotic acid and synthesised 1/5-1/7 amounts of
orotidine-5-phosphate and barely detectable amounts of
uridine-5-phosphate.  These analytical findings are consistant with
observed activities of the decarboxylase and pyrophosphorylase. Though
the synthesis of decarboxylase increasd on azauracil media, the
activity of this enzyme was inhibited. The synthsis of
pyrophosphorylase was reduced on azauracil media while its activity
was apparently not affected..<p>

Hereditary orotic aciduria in man is caused by a defective regulation
of the same two enzymes. Curiously, there are several similarities
between the consequences of a regulatory mutation in the two different
organisms (CHUNG and REDEI 1974).<p>
