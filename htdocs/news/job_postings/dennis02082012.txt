Two Post Doctoral Positions available in the lab of Liz Dennis/Jim Peacock at CSIRO Plant Industry, 
Canberra, Australia to work on the molecular basis of heterosis. We have been studying the 
epigenetic changes that occur when hybrids are formed. Our work has been recently published

Groszmann, M., Greaves, I.K., Albertyn, Z.I., Scofield, G.N., Peacock, W.J., and Dennis, E.S. (2011). 
Changes in 24-nt siRNA levels in Arabidopsis hybrids suggest an epigenetic contribution to hybrid 
vigor. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 108, 2617-
2622.
