This report deals with the primary photoinduced processes in the
mutant V-76 of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. Control was wildtype
Enkheim. Mutant V-76 has yellow leaves, small rosette and its height
is two times less than that of the wildtype.<p>

Table 1 shows that in mutant V-76 the length and the width of cells
and quantity of chloroplasts in one cell is less than in the wildtype.
Chlorophyll content per gramme of raw weight and per unit of area in
the wildtype is 4-5 times more than in the mutant V-76 (Table 2). Low
quantity of chlorophyll b is noticeable in the mtuant leaves; a/b
ratio in the mutant is higher than in the control. Preliminary
investigations show that 14 CO 2 fixation level per unit of leaf
surface in the mutant is somewhat higher than in the control.<p>

"Work" of the photosynthetic apparatus was characterized by following
parameters: induction curves of delayed fluorescence and signals of
electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR) from cation radical of P-700.
Analysis was done on intact leaves and on isolated chloroplasts.
Induction curves of leaves and isolated chloroplasts of both objects
have the same characteristic (Figure 1). Amplitude of the signal in
the leaves of mutant V-76 is less. Fluorescence in the presence of
3-(3.4 dichlorophenyl) -1.1-dimethylurea (DCMU) is also less.
Apparently it is connected with low content of pigments per unit of
leaf surface. However, per unit of chlorophyll the mutant should have
higher intensity of fluorescence. This was proved by experiments on
isolated chloroplasts of subjects under study with equalized
chlorophyll content. In this case DCMU inhibited fluorescence in the
wildtype to a higher degree. It is known that fluorescence is
connected with PS II reactions (Matorin, 1972; Hardt and Malkin,
1974). Thus the results of our experiments show that the mutant V-76
has a larger number of PS II reaction centres per unit of chlorophyll.<p>

chloroplasts (B) of Arabidopsis thaliana<p>

Figure 2 shows that, although different from wildtype, in the mutant
V-76 the level of P-700 oxidation in light is practically the same as
in darkness. It can be supposed that in the leaves of mutant intensive
leakage of electrons from the electron transport chain in dark
reactions, takes place, which is in accordance with the higher speed
of CO2 fixation. In isolated chloroplasts, equalized in chlorophyll
content, the light EPR signal is higher than darkness signal for both
wildtype and the mutant. For the latter one, P-700 oxidation level in
light is lower than for the wildtype which, apparently, is connected
with larger number of PS I reaction centers per unit of chlorophyll.<p>

Hence, under the effect of mutation a certain reorganization of
photosynthetic apparatus has taken place in the mutant V-76, which has
increased the number of PS I and PS II reaction centres and
accordingly the number of electron transport chains per unit
chlorophyll. Lower content of chlorophyll in the mutant V-76 is
connected wih the eduction in the number of antenna pigments and first
of all chlorophyll b.<p>
