Funding is available starting January, 2010 for a graduate research assistant (at the M.S. 
or Ph.D. level) to study functional or evolutionary genomics of climate-related stress 
tolerance in forest trees at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in 
Blacksburg, Virginia. The successful candidate will have a B.S. or equivalent in an 
applicable field (e.g., Biology, Forestry, Molecular Biology) and will join the Department 
of Forest Resources and Environmental Conservation and a collaborative group in the 
Molecular Plant Sciences program with strengths in molecular biology, genomics and 
proteomics. The specific research project will be open to discussion, but may include 
functional characterization of gene families involved in seasonal cold hardiness, genome-
scale searches for the genetic targets of natural selection related to climate, or genotype-
phenotype association studies. Assistantship includes tuition, health coverage, and a 
stipend. Please contact Jason Holliday for further details (jah1@vt.edu).
