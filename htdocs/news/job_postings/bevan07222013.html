<p>
Postdoctoral Scientist 
</p>
<p>
Applications are invited for a Postdoctoral Scientist to work in the group 
of Professor Mike Bevan at the John Innes Centre. 
</p>
<p>
The successful applicant will work on a project that builds on our recent 
discovery of a novel ubiquitin-mediated regulatory cascade that controls 
organ and seed size in Arabidopsis. The project is funded by BBSRC for 
three years and involves close collaboration with Dr Alex Jones at the 
University of Warwick. The aim of this project is to understand the 
mechanisms setting the characteristic final sizes of plant organs and seeds 
by devising strategies for identifying substrates of the E3 ubiquitin 
ligases EOD1/BB and DA2, and by determining the role of these substrates in 
setting organ size. Candidates with a special interest in protein mass 
spectrometry and ubiquitin biochemistry are encouraged to apply. 
</p>

<p>
The successful candidate will have excellent protein biochemistry skills. 
Experience of protein mass spectrometry, ubiquitin biochemistry and plant 
genetics would be highly desirable but not essential. The post-holder will 
work on protein expression and characterization in E. coli, in vitro 
ubiquitination assays, mass spectrometric screens for ubiquitination and 
neddylation, and genetic and biochemical analyses of growth control genes 
in Arabidopsis. 
</p>
<p>
The John Innes Centre is a world-class Institute and is looking to appoint 
an exceptional candidate who has, or expects to soon receive a PhD in

We will be providing the job- holder with opportunities to develop their 
technical and transferable skills during this appointment, by way of 
training programmes, coaching and mentoring. 
</p>
<p>
Salary on appointment will be within the range £28,100 to £34,430 per annum
