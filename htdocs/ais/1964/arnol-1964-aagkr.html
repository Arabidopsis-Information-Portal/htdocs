Vol 01:<h2>ARNOLD, C. G.</h2><h2>Preliminary tests with Contergan (N-phtalyl glutamic acid imid)</h2>

To test whether Contergan is a mutagenic substance and has an
influence also on the development of plants, the following experiment
was carried out: Flowers and pods of Arabidopsis thaliana, race
Enkheim, were treated with a solution of Contergan (1%).  The stems
were split and one half was cut at the base and the end dipped into
the solution for 42 hrs (cf. ROBBELEN 1962c).  Controls were treated
with water.  The development of the embryos treated with Contergan was
in some instances retarded and sometimes stopped in early stages.
Young embryos seem to be more sensitive than older.  The treated
plants produced fewer seeds than the controls.  As the number of
plants was low the experiment has to be repeated.<p>
