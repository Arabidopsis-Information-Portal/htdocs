A postdoctoral position and a PhD assistantship are available immediately 
to study metal micronutrient nutrition in plants.  Research in the lab 
seeks to gain a mechanistic understanding of how plants respond to mineral 
nutrient limitation, the physiological processes that move minerals from 
the soil, through the plant, and into the edible portions, and to 
determine which genes or gene products carry out or regulate these 
processes.  Long term goals of this work are to generate biofortified 
plants for improved human nutrition.  Nutrients of primary interest are 
iron and zinc.  Candidates should be highly motivated and have research 
experience in plant physiology, molecular biology, and/or genetics, and 
should have the ability to work both independently and as part of a team. 
Good communication and writing skills are required.  Interested parties 
should contact Dr. Brian Waters, University of Nebraska, Department of 
Agronomy and Horticulture, at bwaters2@unl.edu.  Please see

information about the assistantship.
