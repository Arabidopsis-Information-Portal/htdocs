STOCK CENTER NEWS

        The stock centers have been working hard in the past few months to
add new stocks to the collections.   Many new seed stocks and clones have
been received recently.  In this connection a seed donation campaign,
conducted jointly by ABRC and NASC, is in progress.   Hence, this update
will be devoted mainly to the topic of new seed donations.   The new stock
donations fit into several categories, which will be addressed separately.

CAMPAIGN FOR DONATION OF NEW PUBLISHED MUTANTS

Letters were recently sent to all senior authors known to have published
papers describing new mutants or other lines.  A number of these
individuals have responded with some interesting donations.  We would like

to remind those that have not responded that now is an excellent time to
send donations to the centers.  Seeds can be sent to either ABRC or NASC.
For those who might have other published seed stocks, we offer apologies
and assurance that we would be delighted to receive your lines, also.

The stocks received to date (combined for ABRC and NASC) are listed below.

These lines were produced by introducing the maize element Ac into
Landsberg erecta by Agrobacterium - mediated transformation.  The Ac
element is inserted into the 5'untranslated leader of a streptomycin
phosphotransferase (SPT) gene (Dean et al [1992] Plant Journal 2, 69-81).
SPT::Ac -> lines contain the wild type Ac in the same orientation as the
SPT gene.  In SPT::Ac (BG)-> lines the Ac element has a Bgl 11 restriction
site inserted downstream of the transposase polyadenylation site.  Both
these lines are homozygous for the T-DNA.
The Nae1Ac lines contain an Ac derivative, lacking 537bp of the CpG-rich 5'
untranslated leader of the transposase.  These lines show a higher excision
frequency and are described in Lawson et al [1994] Mgg 245, 608-615.  
Excision of the Ac element from the SPT gene results in resistance to streptomycin.  
Each Nae1 Ac line is selfed progeny from a highly variegated individual and should
result in germinal excision events in the next generation.

Arabidopsis himalaica   H. Tsukaya

Eric Holub, Jim Beynon and Ian Crute RI Lines
100 RI Lines between Col-5 and Nd-1
F3 seed available.
F9 will have to be bulked.
There is quite a good spread of markers on the F3's since 
 this material was used for their Tor et al, 1994 paper in MPMI

NOTE that these stocks are not currently available - with one exception.
The ABRC has accelerated the release process with the Ac/Ds stocks donated
by Dr. Sundaresan, and these may be ordered from ABRC immediately.  Many of
the remainder will be available very soon.  We will post notices to the
Arabidopsis newsgroup when this occurs.

We greatly appreciate the generosity of the above donors in sharing their
stocks.  We hope that the cooperative spirit evidenced by these donations
will continue.

AC AND DS LINES WITH GENE TRAP AND PROMOTER TRAP CONSTRUCTS

These stocks have all been transformed with Ds elements containing promoter
trap or gene trap constructs or immobilized Ac elements.  As with other
transposon tagging systems the appropriate Ac-carrying line is crossed to
Ds plants to induce the Ds to transpose.  The Ac lines carry transposase
genes linked to a 35S CaMV promoter so that the Ds excision rate is very
high.  The promoter or gene trap constructs of the Ds lines utilize a
b-glucuronidase coding region so that tissues in which expression of the
gene has been activated by the transposition event can be visualized
readily.   In addition, a selection scheme is incorporated into this system
which allows transpositions near the initial Ds site to be excluded, and
the resulting populations of transposition lines are enriched for unlinked
and loosely linked locations.   This system represents a potentially
important new tool for gene cloning and expression study.  Please consult
the original publication for details of the system and individual lines,
including maps of the constructs for all of the stocks (Sundaresan, et al.,
1995. Genes & Development 9:1797-1810).

T-DNA TAGGED LINES

NASC and ABRC are currently working to procure as many T-DNA tagged lines
as possible.  As published previously, lines from the INRA project have
been donated to NASC, and it is hoped that these may be ready for
distribution by mid-1996.   In addition,  the centers are currently seeking
any substantial-sized groups of transformed lines to add to the collection.
 We hope to be able to accumulate in excess of 20,000 lines as rapidly as
possible so that individuals wishing to screen these lines may have the
highest possible probability of finding the desired, tagged gene that can
be reasonably achieved.  Any individual willing to donate such lines should
contact Randy Scholl or Mary Anderson.

The ABRC has a large new collection of DNA stocks, including specifically
large  insert libraries and filters made from these.  Consult previous
issues of Weeds World for details of these stocks.  The Web pages of NASC
() and AIMS () can be consulted for additional details of all available
Arabidopsis stocks.
