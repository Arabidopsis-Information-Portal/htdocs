Written as a summary of the state of the physical map for the
Multinational Coordinated <I>Arabidopsis thaliana</I> Genome Project Year Book.
<hr>
The number of markers mapped using the Landsberg erecta x 
Columbia recombinant inbred lines continued to increase throughout 
the year (currently 379). As the new markers became available, they
were hybridized to the YAC libraries to increase the YAC coverage
of each chromosome. Use of new RFLP markers was generally more
successful in linking YAC contigs than chromosome walking
experiments. The biggest advances in the linking of YAC contigs was
achieved once the CIC YAC library was distributed in May 94. This
library, generated through a collaboration between CEPH/INRA/CNRS, 
France, consists of 1152 clones with an average insert size of
450kb. The library contains very few, if any chimaeric YAC clones.
This library is being used by the Ecker and Goodman labs to add to
the physical map of chromosomes 1, 2 and 3, and the Dean lab for
chromosomes 4 and 5. <P>
The combination of the CIC library, the increased marker coverage
and a few successful walking experiments have resulted in
chromosome 4 being covered by just 15 YAC contigs (Schmidt, West,
Dean). Chromosome 5 is currently covered by 35-40 contigs
(Schmidt, Love, Z. Lenehan, Dean) after having used over 100
markers on 4 YAC libraries. Chromosome 2 (Goodman lab) is covered
by about 40 contigs for a total distance of about 17Mb. The
largest contig on chromosome 2, constructed in part using YAC end
probes, is ~ 3.2Mb covering ~ 5.7cM. A similar level of coverage
has been achieved for chromosomes 1  (Ecker lab). Cosmid contigs
from the Goodman laboratory and EST clones are also being 
integrated into the chromosome 2, 4,  and 5 YAC contigs. 
Efforts are continuing to generate a 1.5Mb cosmid contig (Bancroft, 
Love, Cobbett, Goodman and Dean) covering the region of 
chromosome 4 being sequenced as part of the EC ESSA programme (co-
ordinated by Mike Bevan, Norwich). Currently 9 cosmid contigs 
covering 730kb have been restriction mapped and distributed to 
participating laboratories. Joining of these contigs will require 
alternative strategies due to sequences within the gaps being
repetitive or underrepresented in the cosmid libraries being
screened. Strategies based on YAC subclones, rather than cosmids,
providing the sequencing templates for the next phase of the 
genomic sequencing project are being investigated (Bancroft). On a
smaller scale a ~800kb contig on chromosome 2 is being sequenced
using the multiplex method (Goodman lab).
