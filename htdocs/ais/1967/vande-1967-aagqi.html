	In a previous communication (HEYTING and FEENSTRA, 1966) purpose and method of our studies on reversion of pyrimidineless* mutants were briefly described.  We now can report that after EMS treatment we obtained a number of lines showing in each consecutive generation a segregation in wild (or semi-wild) type and clearly deficient plants when grown on mineral medium, and after propagation by means of non-deficient plants. From eight different originally deficient lines one or more of such "revertant" lines were isolated (see table). Although wide fluctuations occur, in many families a one to  one ratio between growing and non-growing plants is approached.<p>

	The results of crosses between revertants and mutants confirm the non-homozygous character of the former.  Possibly, in the explanation of these phenomena a role will have to be ascribed to interallelic complementation. This hypothesis is now being tested.<p>

	Selecting M1 plants with a revertant sector proved to be difficult, due to the variable and often small effect of such a sector on the growth of the plant as a whole.  Many suspected revertant M1 plants therefore were grown to maturity, if necessary with thiamine added, in order to allow M2-testing.  Only in a relatively small number of cases the occurrence of M2 plants growing clearly better than the original deficient type could be established. From 25 of the 33 pyrimidineless mutants tested so far no revertants could be obtained.  10,000 to 40,000 seeds per line were treated, and these numbers probably are too low to allow conclusions. With one mutant, V 131, however, even after treatment of 78 x 10-E3 seeds no positive result was obtained so that here possibly the conclusion may be drawn that EMS cannot induce reversion.<p>
