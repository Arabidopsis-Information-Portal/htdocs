The Biology Department 
(www.bio.umass.edu/biology&lt;http://www.bio.umass.edu/biology&gt;) at the 
University of Massachusetts Amherst invites applications for a tenure-track 
Assistant Professor positions to start as soon as September 1, 2013 in the 
area of Evolutionary Developmental Biology of Plants. We seek individuals 
with outstanding research, a strong commitment to teaching, and the 
potential to develop and maintain an extramurally funded research program. 
The Biology Department provides an interactive and broad research 
environment, with faculty research spanning all levels of biological 
organization. Especially strong research clusters focus on plant biology, 
cell biology, functional morphology, and evolution. 

New faculty members will have the opportunity to participate in strong 
graduate training programs in Neuroscience and Behavior 
(www.umass.edu/neuro&lt;http://www.umass.edu/neuro&gt;), Plant Biology 
(www.bio.umass.edu/plantbio&lt;http://www.bio.umass.edu/plantbio&gt;), Organismic 
and Evolutionary Biology 
(www.bio.umass.edu/oeb&lt;http://www.bio.umass.edu/oeb&gt;) and Molecular and 
Cellular Biology (www.bio.umass.edu/mcb&lt;http://www.bio.umass.edu/mcb&gt;). 

A Ph.D. in Biology or a related field and postdoctoral experience are 
required. Application materials should include a curriculum vita, research 
plan, and teaching statement. Applicants should also have three reference 
letters sent to the addresses below. Evaluation of applications for the 
positions will begin on October 5, 2012 and continue until the position is 
filled. 


We seek individuals with a strong record of research at the interface 
between developmental and evolutionary biology. Applications are welcome 
from candidates pursuing questions at any phylogenetic level, from the 
origins and mechanisms of evolutionary novelty to the significance of 
phenotypic variation in any group of plants. UMass is home to a live plant 
diversity collection containing nearly 700 genera from more than 225 
families that can be used for teaching and research. 

Application materials may be sent via email to: 
PlantEvoDevoSearch@bio.umass.edu<mailto:PlantEvoDevoSearch@bio.umass.edu>. 

If needed, paper applications can be sent to: PlantEvoDevo Search # R44071, 
Biology Department, Attn: Zoe Crowley, 611 North Pleasant Street, University
