Opportunity for JSPS postdoctoral fellowship


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
    We are looking for candidates interested to apply for JSPS postdoctoral 
fellowship awarded by Japan society for promotion of science. Candidates are 
sought for both standard and short term postdoctoral fellowships. Standard 
program is two year long and open to all. The short term one is available to 
citizens/permanent resident of USA, Canada and selected European countries. JSPS 
provides a good amount of tax free monthly maintenance allowance for both the 
programs along with air tickets, settling allowance and research support money. 

    The primary research interest of my lab lies in plant hormone auxin and 
ethylene. It is a newly established lab in Cryobiosystem Research Center of 
Iwate University. The Center is well equipped with modern facilities and home of 
many warm hearted researchers. To know more about our research please visit our 
lab home page (http://news7a1.atm.iwate-u.ac.jp/~abidur/) and check our recent 
papers cited below. The possible candidates are expected to have a Ph.D. in 
molecular biology, plant molecular biology or a related field. Applicants should 
have experience in molecular biology, gene cloning and analysis of transgenic 
plants. Experience in transgene expression and signal transduction in plant 
systems will be an advantage but not absolutely necessary.

    If you are interested to apply please submit your curriculum vitae 
indicating publications, a brief statement of research experience, and names, 
emails and telephone numbers of three references by email.
