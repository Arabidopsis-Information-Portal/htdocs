A postdoctoral position is available in Dr. Haiyang Wang's laboratory at the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research, 
Cornell University.
Research in the Wang laboratory is primarily focused on understanding signaling mechanisms mediating light control of plant 
development using Arabidopsis as a model system. We take multidisciplinary approaches, including genetics, molecular biology, 
cell biology, biochemistry, and genomics, to identify light signaling molecules, and to elucidate their biochemical and 
cellular mechanisms in transmitting perceived light information to regulate target gene expression and plant photomorphogenic
development (see Yang et al., 2005a, Plant Cell 17, 804-821; Yang et al., 2005b, Plant J. 43, 131-141; Lin and Wang, 2004, Plant 
Physiol. 136, 4010-4022.). More information about the Wang lab can be found at http://bti.cornell.edu/page.php?id=337.
Requirements: A recent Ph.D (within the past five years) in the fields of plant biology, genetics, molecular biology or 
biochemistry. Training in basic molecular skills (nuclear acids and protein isolation, Southern, Northern and Western blot, 
PCR, genotyping, plasmid construction etc.) is required. Prior experience in cell biology skills (familiar with various types 
of microscopes) or biochemistry (protein expression and purification, gel filtration, DNA-protein interaction etc.) will 
be a big plus.  Individuals with strong self-motivation, team-work spirit and good communication skills are highly preferred.
        To apply: send a cover letter summarizing your research interests, experience, and achievements, a CV and names of 
three references to Haiyang Wang (hw75@cornell.edu). Please indicate in your cover letter the job code BTI #2006-05.
         The Boyce Thompson Institute (BTI) is a private non-profit research organization located on the campus of Cornell 
University, Ithaca, New York. BTI is an equal opportunity employer.
