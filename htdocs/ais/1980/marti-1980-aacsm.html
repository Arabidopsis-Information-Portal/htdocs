Department of Genetics, Aberdeen University, Scotland<p>

An auxin resistant mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana was first described
by Maher (1977). This mutant, P83, has a 14-fold increased tolerance
to 2, 4-D, an altered geotropic response and an increased root growth
rate. All three features of the P83 phenotype appear to be the
pleiotropic effects of a single recessive mutation (Maher and
Martindale, 1978, 1980).<p>

Here we present further details of the P83 mutant including the
results of linkage studies and 2, 4-D uptake experiments. It is
proposed that the locus controlling auxin resistance in P83 should be
given the gene symbol aux-1.<p>

LINKAGE STUDIES<p>

To locate the P83 mutation we have used the trisomic set developed in
Landsberg "erecta" by Koornneef and Van der Veen (1978) supplemented
by crosses with single gene markers. The results of the crosses
analyzed so far are summarized in Tables 1 (trisomics) and 2 (single
markers).<p>

The trisomic as female parents were crossed with P83, and F1 trisomic
and F1 disomic progeny were selfed. Samples of the resultant F2 seed
were tested for segregation of resistance on 0.75% agar containing 0.1
mM KNO3 and 0.3 micro M 2,4-D. At this 2, 4-D concentration
susceptible seedling roots are ~ 70% inhibited, whereas resistant
seedlings show only ~ 15% inhibition compared with controls. Seeds
were sown on the agar, given 4 days cold treatment (4*degrees*C) and
then 72 hours in the growth cabinet under continuous illumination (25
+/- 1*degree*C). A significant deviation from a 3:1 ratio in favour of
susceptible seedlings among an F1 trisomic progeny could indicate
linkage of aux-1 to the supernumerary chromosome.<p>

Table 1: The ratio of susceptible : resistant seedlings in the F2
progeny of F1 trisomics and F1 disomics. For T2 the results from six
putative F1 tisomic progenies have been pooled. The *chi*sq. values for
3:1 ratios are given in brackets.<p>

The results show a good correspondence with 3:1 ratios for the three
trisomics T1A, T1B and T4, but a significant deviation for T2. This
suggests that aux-1 is located on chromosome 2 (chromosome number as
proposed by Koornneef and den Besten, 1979). In view of the interest
of the T2 result is has been included in Table 1 although it comes
from a preliminary experiment. We have found T2 to be the most
difficult trisomic to distinguish.<p>

Six plants which had rounded leaves and were later flowering than the
rest of the F1 progeny were selected as putative trisomics. The F2
progeny of these six plants have been pooled to provide the entry in
Table 1. A further analysis of these F2 families is in progress.<p>

T3 progeny was not obtained because of the poor growth and low
fertility of T3, and T5 was not available when these crosses were set
up.<p>

For detection of linkage with the markers shown in Table 2 two
procedures were adopted. The F2 seed of crosses between either hy-1 or
hy2 and aux-1 homozygotes were screened by the method already
described for the F2-s of the trisomic crosses. The hypocotyl lengths
of the mutants were not affected by 2, 4-D and all four F2 phenotypes
were identifiable. In Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) hypocotyl length is plotted
against root length for the F2 progeny from hy-1 and hy-2 crosses
respectively and clearly illustrates the linkage of hy-1 and aux-1
(repulsion phase).<p>

Table 2: F2 segregation data of crosses between aux-1 and various
markers.<p>

For detection of linkage with ch, gl, and er the following procedure
was adopted: F2 seed was sown on agar plus 2, 4-D and germinated as
already described. The resistant seedlings were transferred to
pre-warmed (6 hours, 25 +/- 1*degree*C) glass petri dishes containing
perlite supplemented with mineral medium (for culture conditions see
Maher and Martindale, 1980). After 7 days in the growth cabinet the
seedlings could further classified for ch+/ch and gl+/gl phenotypes.
(>90% survival could be achieved with careful transfer).
Classification of ch+ and ch phenotypes at 72 hours by examination of
the cotyledons prved unreliable.<p>

For er+/er phenotypic identification the transferred seedlings were
potted up in compost after 5-7 days in perlite and allowed to mature
as usual in the greenhouse. (Control homozygous aux-1 seedlings
transferred from plain agar plates to perlite and potted showed no
difference, confirming that the 2, 4-D employed in the original
selection had no effect on the later growth habit of the adult plant).
After a further 10-15 days the plants were scored for er+/er
phenotypes.<p>

177 F2 individuals from the (er+ aux-1+)/(er aux-1) were scored for
er+/er, selfed, and the F3 families screened for 2, 4-D
resistance. The results provide a value of 18.7% recombination for er
-aux 1, which compares favourably with the value of 18.0% quoted in
Table 2.<p>

From Table 2 it can be seen that aux-1 is linked to each of the
chromosome 2 markers, er, and hy-1. F2 progeny from crosses with two
other chromosome 2 markers, py and chl-2, are currently being tested.<p>

We are also testing a serrated leaf marker which is linked to aux-1.
This may be identical to se which was localized to chromosome 2 by
Redei and Hirono (1964). They tested se with er and found no double
mutants in a F population.<p>

(0=seedlings with extended hypocotyls. In case of doubt they may be
distinguished by yellow cotyledons (hy-1) or by allowing seedlings to
continue growth after 96 hours when the difference becomes very clear
in hy-1 and hy-2).<p>

Uptake of [2- 14C] 2, 4-D<p>

It has been suggested that the increased 2, 4-D resistance of aux-1
could be caused by alteration in one of a number of factors including
uptake, endogenous auxin biosynthesis, metabolism, transport and
reception of the auxin (Maher and Martindale, 1980). It seemed
unlikely that uptake could be the only factor affected in view of the
other phenotypic features of the mutant, but in order to test for
differential uptake several experiments were carried out including the
two described here.<p>

In the first experiment wild type and P83 seeds were sown on plain
agar, stored for 4 days at 4*degrees*C and placed in the growth
cabinet at 25+/- 1*degree*C for 72 hours. Root lengths were measured
before placing batches of 20 wild type or mutant seedlings in small
baskets and totally immersing them in distilled water for 30 minutes
after which the baskets were transferred to [2- 14C] 2, 4-D(pH 7.5 500
microM). At intervals batches of seedlings were removed, washed with
25 ml of "cold" 2, 4-D and totally immersed in distilled water for 10
minutes. The seedlings were then blotted dry, wrapped in tissue paper
and stored at -20*degrees*C. When all the samples had been collected
seedlings were combusted in a sample oxidiser to give 14 CO 2 which
was absorbed by a scintillation cocktail. During the course of the
experiment (100 mins.) the pH of the [2- 14 C] 2, 4-D bathing solution
remained unchanged and no measurable extension of wild type or mutant
roots occurred. In order to allow for the greater growth rate of
mutant roots in the period preceding uptake, the c.p.m. values were
adjusted to equivalent root lengths.<p>

The experiment was performed six times in all with various
modifications. On each occasion, the results provided the same
information with the uptake of label by the mutant lagging behind that
of the wild type (Figure 2). In one experiment the mutant seed, which
germinates before the wild type, was held back and placed in the
growth cabinet after the wild type to give seedling roots of
approximately equal length at the commencement of uptake. Here too the
mutant uptake lagged behind that of the wild type as in Figure 2. It
remains to be confirmed whether the 14 C has remained associated with
the 2, 4-D molecul to the same extent in both genotypes.<p>

Figure 2: Time course of [2-14 C] 2,4-D uptake: wild type and
resistant mutant, aux-1.<p>

It seemed unlikely that differences in uptake of the order shown in
Figure 2 could account fully for the 14-fold increased tolerance to 2,
4-D of the mutant. A second type of experiment was performed to study
the accumulation of 14C in seedlings over a much longer period. Seed
were germinated on agar containing various concentrations of [2-14C]
2, 4-D and after 72 hours (25 +/- 1*degree*C, continuous illumination)
root lengths were measured and the total seedling content of 14C
estimated as before.<p>

In Figure 3 the dose-response curves and 14C content per batch of 40
wild type or mutant seedlings are plotted. The dose-response curve
shows the expected difference in root inhibition between the two
genotypes, but their 14 C contents, which are proportional to the
exogenous [2- 14C] 2, 4-D concentration, are remarkably similar. Thus
wild type seedlings with short inhibited roots and their mutant
counterparts with much longer roots contain comparable amounts of
radioactivity. It can also be seen that inhibition of root extension
occur at much lower levels of exogenous 14C in the wild type than in
the mutant. For exmaple, a batch of wild type seedlings with roots
which are 42% of the control length contains 260 cpm of 14C, but a
batch of mutants with roots at 45% of the control length contains 1634
cpm of 14C.<p>

seedlings (40 seedlings per batch).<p>

CONCLUSION<p>

This suggests that the mutant does not achieve its increased tolerance
to 2, 4-D simply by exclusion of the auxin or even by a reduced rate
of uptake, but that the mutation also involves some endogenous
alteration which mitigates the effect of the auxin after uptake. The
nature of this alteration remains at present a subject for
speculation, but must also explain the other features of the aux-1
phenotype which involve the altered growth of roots in the absence of
exogenous 2, 4-D. If auxin is acting as an inhibitor in Arabidopsis
roots and if auxin transport is an important consequence of
geostimulation a mutation which lowered the endogenous levels of auxin
or adversely affected its transport or reception might have the effect
of increasing growth rate and affecting the response of roots to
gravity. As the role, if any, of auxin in root geotropism is far from
clear further study of the aux-1 mutation may provide useful
information.<p>
