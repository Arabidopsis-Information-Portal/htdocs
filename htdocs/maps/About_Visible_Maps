The attached map of visible markers was constructed by JOINMAP, a
computer mapping program written by Piet Stam (Wageningen Agricultural
University).

Only pairwise recombination estimates for visible markers were used to
make this particular map.  Most of the recombination data were
supplied by Maarten Koornneef and David Meinke.

Molecular data involving RFLP markers and recombinant inbred lines
were excluded from this map because their inclusion resulted in maps
that were inconsistent with available data for visible markers.

This map should be viewed as simply an estimate of gene locations
based on available genetic data.

In most cases, the orientation of closely-linked genes has not been
clearly established.

Mean chi-square values are reported by JOINMAP as each marker is added
to the map.  Higher values indicate more contradictions and therefore
greater uncertainty in map location.  The first two markers placed by
JOINMAP on each linkage group have mean chi-square values of 0.000.

Fixed gene orders used by JOINMAP in map preparation are listed below
(orientations are based on 3-point data unless otherwise noted):
