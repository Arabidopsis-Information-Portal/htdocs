<H2>Session 10: Growth regulators II</H2>

<B>Chair: Ruth Finkelstein, UC Santa Barbara</B> <P>
<hr>

The Growth Regulator II session focused on mechanisms 
of abscisic
acid and gibberellic acid signaling. Arabidopsis loci 
involved in abscisic
acid response have been identified by altered sensitivity 
to ABA inhibition
of germination (Koornneef <I>et al</I>. 1984; Finkelstein 1994; 
Finkelstein <I>et al</I>.
1995; Cutler <I>et al</I>.1995) or root growth (Grill <I>et al</I>.1993). 
Finkelstein (UC
Santa Barbara) reported analyses of digenic ABA-insensitive 
(abi) mutants
obtained from the germination-based screens consistent 
with at least two
ABA response pathways: one primarily vegetative pathway 
involving ABI1,
ABI2 and ABI7 and one seed-specific pathway involving 
ABI3, ABI4, ABI5, and
ABI6. Combinations of even relatively weak alleles from 
these two classes
greatly enhance insensitivity of mature seeds, in some 
cases resulting in
severely reduced seed longevity (e.g. abi2 abi3-1). 
Comparison of
seed-specific gene expression in abi3-1, abi4, and abi5 
supports the
hypothesis that ABI3 acts upstream of ABI4 and ABI5.

Leung (CNRS,
Gif-sur-Yvette) described functional studies of ABI1, 
previously cloned by
chromosome walking and shown to be a member of the protein 
phosphatase IIC
family (Leung <I>et al</I> 1994; Meyer <I>et al</I>. 1994). The dominant 
abi1-1 allele
was introduced into Nicotiana benthamiana and shown 
to disrupt
ABA-regulation of guard cell potassium channels, producing 
a wilty
phenotype similar to that seen in the Arabidopsis mutant. 
The defect in
guard cell response could be partially overcome by exposure 
to protein
kinase inhibitors, supporting the view that this ABA 
signaling pathway
involves a protein phosphorylation cascade. <P>

Cutler (recently of U Toronto)
presented a characterization of the first Arabidopsis 
mutant with enhanced
response to ABA (era1), also isolated by a germination-based 
screen and
exhibiting seed-specific effects. The ERA1 gene was 
cloned by virtue of
having a T-DNA tagged allele; sequence analysis of genomic 
and cDNA clones
showed it to encode a beta-subunit of a protein farnesyl 
transferase.
Farnesylation is known to be important to membrane localization 
and/or
function of RAS and trimeric G proteins, consistent 
with a role for
G-proteins or some other membrane-anchored signaling 
component in ABA
response.<P>

GA signaling was discussed by Harberd (John Innes Centre, 
Norwich)
and Jacobsen (recently of U Minnesota). The semi-dominant 
gai mutation of
Arabidopsis confers gibberellin (GA)-insensitive dwarfism 
and identifies a
gene (GAI) whose product is likely to be involved in 
GA-related signal
transduction (Koornneef <I>et al</I>. 1985). Harberd's group 
has isolated both
intra- and extragenic (gas1 and gas2) suppressors of 
the gai dwarf
phenotype.  Some of the intragenic suppressors were 
created by insertion of
a mobilized linked Ds element, thereby tagging the GAI 
locus; DNA
sequencing of GAI, gai and associated cDNAs is in progress. 
Singly, the gas
mutants only partially suppress the gai phenotype, but 
the triple
homozygote (gas1, gas2, gai) has wild-type height. The 
gas1-1 mutation
appears to reduce the dependency of plant growth on 
GA since, although
growing taller than the gai progenitor, the gai gas1-1 
double mutant does
not display enhanced GA responsiveness.  In contrast 
to this suppressor
screening, the SPINDLY (SPY) locus was identified by 
screening for
germination/elongation in the presence of the GA biosynthesis 
inhibitor
paclobutrazol (Jacobsen <I>et al</I>. 1993). The spy-4 allele 
was created by T-DNA
insertion, facilitating cloning of the locus. Sequence 
analysis shows
significant homology to a gene of unknown function from 
C. elegans, leading
Jacobsen <I>et al</I>. to suggest that these are members of 
a family of regulatory
genes.<P>
