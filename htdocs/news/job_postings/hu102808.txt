MSU-DOE Plant Research Laboratory, Michigan State University. The successful 
candidate will use proteomics, bioinformatics, cell biology, and reverse genetics to study 
peroxisomal protein networks in Arabidopsis and follow up newly identified proteins 
with hypothesis-driven approaches. The applicant should have a PhD degree in 
biochemistry, molecular biology, genetics, or a related field, and publications in 
international journals. Prior experience with plant biochemistry and a background or 
interests in bioinformatics are preferred. Funding is available for two years with the 
possibility of extension. Interested applicants should email a CV, a brief statement of 
research experience, and names and contact information of three references to Jianping
