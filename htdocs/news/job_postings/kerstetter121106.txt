Multiple Tenure-Track Faculty Positions at Rutgers

The Waksman Institute at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey,
invites applications for multiple tenure-track faculty positions at the 
Assistant, Associate, and Full Professor levels.

The Waksman Institute maintains diverse areas of research, with
strengths in developmental biology, cell biology, neurobiology, microbiology, 
protein biochemistry, structural biology, molecular machines, signal 
transduction, and plant genomics/bioinformatics. The Faculty at the Institute 
use a range of different animal, plant, and microbial model organisms in their 
genetic research and would welcome a variety of experimental approaches.  
Demonstrated excellence in research is more important than the area of research.  
The successful applicant will be expected to develop and maintain an externally-
funded research program and to teach at the undergraduate and graduate level. 
Preference will be given to individuals whose interests could be synergistic 
with ongoing research programs at the Institute. Applicants should submit their 
credentials through our secure Web-based application form at 
http://waksmansearch.rutgers.edu/apply/ .

Applicants should have a Ph.D., Pharm.D., M.D. or equivalent degree and relevant 
post-doctoral experience. Consideration of applications will begin on January 
15, 2007, but this position will remain open until filled.

Ad to appear in the December 15th issue of Science.
