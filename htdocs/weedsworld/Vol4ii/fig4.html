<FONT SIZE=+0>Figure 4. Summary of the 1.7 Mb clone
contig. The positions of the cosmids are illustrated relative to projected
<I>Sal</I>I or <I>Bam</I>HI restriction maps, as indicated. The numbers
in boxes represent the sizes of restriction fragments as determined by
summation of the sizes (determined by agarose gel electophoresis) of fragments
produced by cleavage of cosmids and BACs with restriction endonucleases.
The approximate positions of selected YACs from the YAC-based physical
map of this region of the genome are idicated by broken, double-headed
arrows.</FONT>
