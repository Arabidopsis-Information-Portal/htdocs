One Ph.D and one M.S. Graduate Assistantship in 
 
Plant Biotechnology – Bioenergy at the University of Florida 
 
 
 
One Ph.D and one M.S. Graduate Assistantship is available for Spring 2009 in the Laboratory of 
Plant Molecular Physiology, headed by Dr. Fredy Altpeter 
(http://agronomy.ifas.ufl.edu/faculty/altpeter.shtml). Our research integrates advanced genetic 
transformation technology and functional genomics to identify, isolate and engineer limiting 
factors for molecular improvement of biomass/bioenergy grasses 
(http://agnetonline.com/2008/03/24/uf-receives-1m-to-unlock-energy-from-sugarcane-residues/). 
 
 
 
Lignocellulosic materials produced by biomass grasses are a promising feedstock to produce 
low-cost ethanol, their improvement using biotechnological approaches will reduce costs 
associated with biomass conversion to fuel. Risk assessment and development of risk 
management strategies are essential components of this molecular grass improvement program. 
 
 
 
The selected candidate will focus on construction of plant expression vectors for over-expression 
of candidate genes, generation of transgenic or mutagenized grasses, molecular, phenotypic and 
physiological characterization of transgenic grasses. The preferred candidate would have hands-
on experience in a range of molecular biology and/or tissue culture protocols.
