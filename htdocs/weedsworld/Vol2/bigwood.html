One of the difficulties in searching any data resource is the
lack of a facility to find items that are close to, but not
exactly like, the search term(s) of interest.  Wildcarding (e.g.,
the use of asterisks in some search software) aids the user to a
certain degree, but often the results returned are not exactly
what is desired.  A fuzzy searching facility, using a program
called agrep, is provided on the Agricultural Genome World Wide
Web Server at the National Agricultural Library.  A brief
description of how to use this facility, along with some hints
and examples, follows. <P>

To connect with the agrep search form open the following URL in
your World Wide Web browser: <P>

<A HREF="http://probe.nalusda.gov:8300/agrepquery.html">
http://probe.nalusda.gov:8300/agrepquery.html</a> <P>

You will be presented with a form similar to that shown in Figure 1, below:

 <P>
The form allows you to select three search parameters; case-
sensitivity (default: case-insensitive), whether to search for
the pattern as a "word" (as opposed to the possibility of the
pattern being embedded anywhere in the text; default: search for
pattern as a word), and whether or not to search for the pattern
as a superset (e.g., "the only" matches "the one and only";
default: do not search for pattern as a superset).  You may also
select zero, one, or two mismatches.  A mismatch may be an
insertion (e.g., "Lansberg" will match "Landsberg"), a deletion
("adh-1" will match "adh1", or a substitution ("Smith" will match
"Smyth").  A cautionary note: allowing two mismatches can result
in a slew of unexpected results, particularly if one short search
term is used.  For example, searching for the pattern "adh" with
two mismatches will bring back any object containing an a, d, or
h.
 <P>
One simple, but common, use for agrep is to account for
differences in the British and American spellings of various
words such a center/centre and color/colour.  Other common usages
include searching for a person's name for which you are unsure of
the spelling, and to accommodate slight differences in gene
nomenclature among taxa.
 <P>
Search terms can be combined to perform boolean searches using a
terse notation: "this,that" translates to "this or that";
"here;there" translates to "here and there".  The wildcard
character is "#" and it can be used anywhere in the search
term(s).
 <P>
The agrep form also provides a suite of plant and other databases
to search.  These can be searched together or selected a la
carte.  Because there is a limit of 1000 objects, this is a
useful way of limiting your search.  In addition, because agrep
searching involves paging through large text files, you can save
time by selecting only the databases of interest.
 <P>
The results document (Figure 2, below) 
 <P>
<hr>

 <P>
presents you with a list of
objects that match the search terms.  At the top of this document
the search string is displayed along with the databases that were
searched.  The names of the objects that contain the search
string are then listed, grouped by the object's class (e.g.,
locus or paper) and database.  Clicking on an object's name will
bring up the full data object (Figure 3, below).
