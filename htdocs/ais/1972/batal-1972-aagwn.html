The genetic nature of several pigment mutant forms was studied by
crossing them with the markers gl1an (glabra = absence of hairs on the
rosette leaves - 3rd linkage group, angulosa = narrow, stretched leaf
- 1st linkage group; REDEI, 1955).  The Table 1 shows that mutant
strains ch(B) and "morphological", induced from ch(B), differ from the
other forms by their heterozygosis in respect to lethal factors, which
display in the appearace of vana type embryonic lethal (MULLER, 1963)
in 2/3 of the posterity; this indicates to us that these mutations may
be of the chromosome type.  Our conclusion is confirmed statistically
by analysis of the genotypic ratios inside the hybrid posterity in F2
and for gl+/gl- and an+/an- at the probability ratios 3:1 using the
chi square method.<p>

Table 1: Characteristics of the investigated pigment mutants<p>

The mutants described in Table 2 may be divided into two groups: (1)
mutants 24/45 "morphological", and a half of families from crossings
of the mutant ch(B) show declination from segregation 15:1, displayed
in the high number of recessives and (2) 117/2, spurio maculata, and
another half of families from ch(B), having no such declination.
Mutants 117/2 and spurio maculata behave like true gene mutations.
Thus it is assumed, that the mutants "morphological" and 24/25 belong
to the chromosome type with lethal effects in chromosome 1 for 24/25
or chromosomes 1 and 3 for the "morphological" mutant.<p>

Table 2: Results of the analysis of the hybrid postrity by the ratio
of sums of dominant classes to the quanta of double recessives<p>

Double character of behavior of the mutants ch(B) in crossings is,
probably, explained by different quality of gametes, formed in the
process of meiosis (the change of the reciprocal translocation type is
possible), as a result of that half of hybrid families from this
crossing behaves in some cases as the posterity of gene mutation, in
other cases as the posterity determined by the chromosome change.<p>

More detailed description of the results of the genetic analysis is
presented in the publication of BATALOV and KVITKO (1971)<p>
