	M. J. LAWRENCE and D.F. MATZINGER:  Some knowledge of the inheritance of quantitative characters in Arabidopsis is a desirable preliminary to broader studies concerning response to selection, the genetic structure of wild populations, and the expressivitity of genes determining such characters.  Accordingly an experiment designed to provide some information about the technically convenient characters flowering time, height, and leaf number has recently been carried out.  The breeding design used was a complete diallel using nine inbred lines as parental material and F1, F2 and back cross generations of all families in a completely randomized experiment in agar.  The results are geing analyzed at present.

	M.E. DENEEN and M.J. LAWRENCE:  The genetic structure of wild populations with reference to quantitative characters.  Experimental analyses of the distribution, amount and nature of genetic variation in wild populations begun some lyears ago in this Department with other species, have been extended recently to include Arabidopsis.  The early results indicate that populations differ markedly in respect of both, the mean expression and their amounts of genetic variance for a character.  Part at least of this genetic variance is caused by segregation, although part also may be due to differences between different homozygotes.<p>

	It has become clear also that it is necessary to vernalize much of the material in order to be able (1) to make contemporary comparisons between progenies and thereby avoid the need for scale transformation, (2) to make crosses between widely different flowering types, and (3) to be able to raise progenies on agar culture.<p>

	J. ASHRAF:  Ecological resistance of Arabidopsis.  Studies on the physiology of resistance to various unfavourable climatic factors are underway.  Of special interest are the relationship of this resistance to the formation of ecotypes, the molecular basis of increase in resistance and the inheritance of resistance to various unfavourable factors.  Preliminary tests were run to standardize the criteria and methods for determining a plant to be resistant. <p>

	B.A. LEVENKO:  Study on the protective effect of cysteine against gamma-rays in Arabidopsis.  Seeds of the races Enkheim and Limburg were soaked in solutions of cysteine (0.005 and 0.05 M respectively) for 24 hrs.  For control seeds were soaked in water.  Immediately after soaking the seeds were irradiated with gamma-rays (10 and 20 kR resp.; 49 R/sec) and sown in soil.  No differences were observed in speed of development, time of flowering and maturity, plant height and number of siliques between plants, which were grown from seeds soaked in water or cysteine solutions.  Seeds were collected separately from individual plants for the determination of the number and the spectrum of chlorophyll mutations, which is now underway.<p>

	O.P. KAMRA:  Report from Dalhousie University, Department of Biology, Halifax, N.S. &#199;anada:  Three graduate students from this Department have submitted theses for their M.Sc. degree in Biology with Arabidopsis used as an experimental organism. Their findings can be summarized as follows:<p>

	M.D. CASSELMAN:  A study on regeneration in leaves of Arabidopsis, 1966.  Plants of race Estland were grown under aseptic conditions in an inorganic nutrient - agar medium under 16 hrs illumination a day and at a constant temperature of 25*degrees*C.  The ability of the laminae of Arabidopsis to regenerate on a basal inorganic medium supplemented with carbohydrates, vitamins, amino acid, and growth regulating substances was studied. A quantitative investigation of this ability was carried out, and the effects of such factors as type of laminae, initial size, and age were described.  Moreover the ability of various parts of the laminae to regenerate was studied.  It was found that there was a differential ability or gradient of regeneration in basal, middle and apical portions of the laminae.  The effect of various factors such as age, type of laminae, light, the presence of naphthalene acetic acid, sucrose and auxin in the nutrient medium, on the gradient of regeneration was investigated.<p>

	Wen-Haw WANG:  Some observations on regeneration in Arabidopsis, 1965.  Plants were grown under sterile conditions on nutrient - agar medium in test tubes under at least 16 hrs illumination in a constant temperature (25*degrees*C).  Calli and adventitious roots were formed from cut ends of nearly all explants cultured on basal medium containing proper supplements.  Adventitious buds, however, were formed only from the very basal portion of excised leaves cultured in darkness.  Light conditions were found to be important for the initiation of regenerated tissue and organs from explants.  Subsequent development of organized tissue or organs was promoted by the addition of coconut milk in the medium.  The synergistic combination of growth substance (NAA) with vitamins, amino acid, and urea or with coconut milk was found to be an important factor in the stimulation and support of regenerated tissue and organs.  Anatomical observations on intact plant and on regenerated tissue and organs, with special reference to the leaves have shown that all regenerated tissue and organs are endogenous in origin and that callus tissue has a great potentiality to differentiate into organized tissue and organs.  Polarity in regenertion of isolated parts of the plant has been found.  Development of reactivated axillary buds on intact plants as well as on excised leaves cultured in vitro was described and discussed.<p>

	Dorothy P. JEFFREY:  Somatic and genetic effects of incorporated strontium-90 and cesium-137, phosphorus-32 and acute gamma ray exposure of seeds were investigated.  Incorporated radioisotopes can cause early flowering in A. thaliana.  Just so can acute 300 R and 3000 R X-ray treatment of dry seeds bring about earlier vegetative as well as floral development.  Strontium -90 remains in the stems and leaves of plants which have been grown on medium containing it while cesium-137 is relocated during the development of the plant finally to the flowers and fruits. Both are retained by the seeds of M1 plants in concentrated form and are redistributed to M2 plants giving low chronic exposures to the M2 generation as well.  This, however, is not sufficient to induce earlier flowering of the M2 plants. - Incorporation of radioisotopes in M1 seeds can cause physiological changes such as loss of apical dominance, dwarfism, gigantism and death in the M1 plants.  In the M2 generation gene mutations appeared although an equivalent amount of gamma ray exposure given as an acute treatment to seeds failed to produce any genetic changes.<p>
