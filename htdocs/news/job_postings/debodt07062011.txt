molecular genetics,
genomics and bioinformatics to unravel developmental processes in plants.
The Systems
Biology of Yield group, headed by Prof. Dirk Inzé, is focusing on the
integration of multiple
data sources (genomics, transcriptomics, phenotyping) to investigate the
complex regulation
of plant growth in relation to the environment.
