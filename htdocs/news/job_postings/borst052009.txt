Postdoctoral position
Wageningen University
Laboratory of Biochemistry/Microspectroscopy Centre
www.bic.wur.nl or www.mscwu.wur.nl
Duration: 3 years
Project description: Receptor-like/Pelle kinases (RLKs) are important components of 
many different signaling networks in plants. RLKs control plant development and 
hormone responses, stress responses, as well as defense against bacterial and fungal 
pathogens. RLKs and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known to play important 
roles in both development and stress adaptation but their interactions are largely 
unknown. Within an ERA-PG project whose aim is to understand the biochemical and 
physiological role of RLKs in ROS signaling and development, a funded post-doc 
position is available to determine affinities among different RLKs upon stimulation 
and stress using spectroscopic methods like competion FRET and quantitative 
microscopy.
The work will be performed in the Laboratory of Biochemistry and 
Microspectroscopy Centre (MSC) of Wageningen University. The laboratory of 
Biochemistry has substantial experience in RLK signaling in plants and is well 
accommodated for biochemical and genetic analysis of these processes. The MSC is 
an excellent facility for optical (micro-) spectroscopic analysis as required for this 
project.
Applicants should hold a Ph.D. in fluorescence spectroscopy, molecular/cell biology 
with 0-5 years postdoctoral research experience. Interested candidates are invited to 
send their CV to: JanWillem.Borst@wur.nl
Send applications (CV, list of publications, names and contact information for 2-3 
persons for reference) before 1st of July by email. Applications are evaluated 
continuously and the position may be filled before the date mentioned. Phone number:
