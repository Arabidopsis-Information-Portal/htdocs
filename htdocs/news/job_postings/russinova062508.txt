CropDesign NV, located in Gent, Belgium is one of the worldwide leading , inoovative 
biotech companies, focusing on the improvement of crops.  CropDesign has developed 
the high throughput phenotyping platform called TraitMill TM. This TraitMill platform is 
used to unravel the function of thousands of genes involved in yield and yield stability 
signalling pathways. CropDesign is a subsidiary of BASF Plant Science.  Together with 6 
other competitive research centres across the world, we form the global research platform 
of BASF Plant Science with the common goal to develop new improved products.  
Within the framework of the FP7 BRAVISSIMO project, coordinated by the Flemish 
Intstitute of Biotechnology (VIB, Gent, Belgium), CropDesign is looking for a young not 
graduated PhD student with a european non-belgian citizenship and with less that 4 years 
experience in Biology research. 
 
This BRAVISSIMO project is to discover new pathways involved in brassinosteroids in 
plants. The work to be done is directed towards crop improvement, mostly rice but with 
applications in other cereals and other crops such as corn and soybean. The student we 
are looking for should be very motivated, able to work in a group and in a company 
environment.  Ideally the candidate would defend his/her PhD around December 2008.
