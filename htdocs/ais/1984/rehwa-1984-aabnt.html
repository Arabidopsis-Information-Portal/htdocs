Long term storage of seeds is important for research requiring the
preservation of specific genetic strains. However, we have found no
record of successful long term storage of seeds of Arabidopsis
thaliana. The use of cold, dessication, and long oxygen levels has
been proposed by Gomez-Campo (1976). Gresshoff and Gartner (1977)
described seeds storage in liquid nitrogen. We have been able to
demonstrate full germinability of seeds stored for 20 years.<p>

The seeds tested were a mixture of approximately equal numbers of
seeds from three varieties. The varieties and sources of our original
stocks were: Enkheim from Dr. L. Langridge, Stockholm from Dr. K.
Napp-Zinn, Landsberg mutant assymetric leaf (as) from Dr. G.P. Redei.
Seeds samlples were stored in manila "coin" envelopes (5.5cm x 0 cm).
These were kept in a large container with a tight fitting lid. A small
jar containing an indicating dessicant (anhydrous CaSO 4) was kept in
the container. The containers were stored in a home-type refrigerator.
No special care was taken when the containers were opened at various
times during the storage period. This method of storage is simple,
economical, and requires little space. Several thousand seed samples
can be stored on one shelf of a home type refrigerator. The use of
paper envelopes allows space to record information about the seed
sample.<p>

Germination was on three layers of Whatman Number 1 filter paper in
petri dishes. The seeds were moistened with 4ml of 1-E-2M KNO 3 per
dish and distilled water was added as needed.<p>

Seeds were given a cold treatment in darkness at 5*degrees*C (+
1*degree*) of either 5 days or 10 days. Incubation was at 23*degrees*C
(+/- 1*degree*) for 5 days. One set of seeds was incubated under
continuous light and another set in darkness. The dark conditions were
briefly interrupted when water was added and when the seeds were
examined for germination. All treatments were in duplicate.
Germination was determined at 2, 3 and 5 days of incubation. The
results ware given in Table 1.<p>

Table 1: Germination (p.c.) of 20 year old A. thaliana seeds stored
under cool, dry, and dark conditions.<p>

The seeds proved to be highly germinable after 20 years of storage.
The highest germination, 100% in some samples, was achieved when both
inbibition and incubation took place in darkness. Five days of cold
treatment appeared to be nearly as effective as 10 days in breaking
dormancy. Germination under continuous light was 75% to 97% after 5
days of incubation; this would be the preferred method if nonetiolated
seedlings are required.<p>

These results demonstrate that dessicated seeds stored under cool, and
dark conditions retain full viability and germinability for at least
20 years; it would seem likely that much longer periods of viability
can be achieved. We are storing aliquot samples of our 20 year old
seeds for future tests on longevity.<p>
