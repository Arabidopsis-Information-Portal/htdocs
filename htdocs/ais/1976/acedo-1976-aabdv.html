All forms of life must possess a regulatory mechanism in order to
survive.  In bacteria, the regulation and operation of some metabolic
reactions are already well-elucidated, but the complexity of higher
plants poses problems in the study of control mechanisnms. The raw
materials for the synthesis of amino acids in biological systems can
come from several sources, so a limit in the activity and/or synthesis
of the key enzymes in the system helps to regulate the concentration
of cellular metabolites. A knowledge of the regulation of amino acid
metabolism in higher plants is of value in understanding genetic,
physiological, and biochemical processes, and from an agronomic point
of view, the manipulation of the biosynthetic pathways can provide
great potentials for crop improvement.<p>

Auxotrophs would also be useful for such studies; unfortunately, very
few exist in higher plants.  The only authentic auxotrophs known so
far are those of the thiamine pathway (Redei, 1975), and the one
defective in proline metabolism (Gavazzi et al., 1975).  In
Arabidopsis, a mutant with positive response to leucine feeding has
been reported (Kasyanenko, 1971).  Nitrate reductase mutants have been
isolated and characterized by Oostindier-Braaksma and Feenstra (1973).
In our laboratory, we found a mutant with a defect in the regulation
of amino acid metabolism. The existence of amino acid regulatory
mutants in higher plants is hitherto unreported.<p>

Mutant 405-A-154 shows sensitivity to casein hydrolyzate.  Several
amino acids severely inhibit growth of the plants when added singly at
a concentration of 5 x 10E-4M to the basal nutrient medium. Valine and
glutamic acid or glutamine are especially deleterious. With valine,
there is a complete inhibition of growth and the effect of the other
amino acids is relatively less severe.  Occasionally, a slight
stimulation of growth of the mutant is observed on cysteine.  Other
mutants that are similar in phenotype to A-154 show no sensitivity to
casein hydrolyzate (Table 1).<p>

Different combinations of the amino acids show that the toxic effect
of valine is relieved by isoleucine, but leucine plus valine give an
additive inhibitory effect.  Plants grown on leucine, isoleucine, and
valine mixture show barely any inhibition of growth (Fig. 1).  No
toxic effect was observed when plants are fed with
(alpha*-oxoisovalerate, a precursor of valine,
*alpha*-oxo-*beta*-methylvalerate, a precursor of isoleucine, and
*alpha*-oxoisocaproate, a precursor of leucine.  Also, the D-isomers
of valine and leucine show no inhibitory effect on the growth of
A-154.<p>

It is known that NH4 ions interfere with the uptake of some amino
acids, notably of arginine (Grenson et al., 1966).  Since we commonly
use NH4NO3 in the basal salt media, other nitrogen sources were tried
alone or in combination with the amino acids.  On KNO3 medium, even
the wild type became inhibited in growth at a concentration of valine
that is not deleterious on NH4NO3 (Table 2).  Both genotypes grow
generally less well on KNO3 than on HN4NO3.  Urea is also a poor
nitrogen source.<p>

Table 2: The growth of Arabidopsis wild type and mutant A-154 on
either NH4NO3 or KNO3 medium with 5 x 10 10E-4M amino acid
supplements. Data in mgs. dry weight.<p>

The respone of both the wild type and the mutant to KNO3 and NH4NO3
seems to indicate that there is indeed a difference in the uptake of
amino acids in the presence of the N4 ions. When plants of both
genotypes are fed with radioactive valine (14C-valine), less valine is
taken up by the roots or by the leaves on the NH4NO3 than on KNO3.  On
a fresh weight basis, the amount of valine taken up by the wild type
and the mutant is not much different; however, this indicates that
uptake is not the primary problem of the mutant and the defect is in
another area of the metabolism.<p>

The process by which atmospheric nitrogen is utilized by plants
involves a process of reduction by enzymes; the first of them is
nitrate reductase. Though regulation of enzyme synthesis in higher
plants is not as well-explored as in prokaryotes, there is evidence
that nitrate reductase is a strictly regulated enzyme.  Induction of
nitrate reductase activity has been reported in corn (Schrader and
Hageman, 1967), radish (Ingle et al., 1966), and cauliflower (Afridi
and Hewitt, 1964).  It is possible that the adverse effect of these
amino acids on mutant A-154 is a direct consequence of nitrogen
starvation caused by inhibition of nitrate reductase. Filner (1966)
attributed the inhibition of growth of cultured tobacco cells by amino
acids to the action of these compounds on nitrate reductase.  In
duckweed, the activities of nitrate reductase and nitrate reductase
are low when grown on amino acids (Joy, 1969).<p>

Preliminary results, however, indicate that A-154 is not a nitrate
reductase mutant.  It is a common observation that nitrate reductase
mutants are much less sensitive to chlorate than their normal sibs.
When grown on sodium chlorate, the response of the mutant is similar
to that of the wild type.  The amount of nitrate in the mutant,
determined by the method of Woolley et al., (1960), is even slightly
lower on a fresh weight basis than in the wild type.<p>

The regulation of many biosynthetic enzymes is under feedback control.
Feedback regulation operates either by inhibition of the first enzymes
in the pathway or by repression of the synthesis of one or more
enzymes by the advanced or end-products (Demain, 1973).<p>

The biochemical control of the pathways of the branched amino acids
where valine, leucine, and isoleucine belong is complex.  Several
alternative patterns have been found in photosynthetic bacteria; among
them are izoenzymic control, sequential feedback, linked pathway
control, concerted and compensatory feedback, and multivalent
repression (Datta, 1969).  Some of these regulatory mechanisms are
also found in higher plants (Miflin, 1973).  The major pathway of
leucine, valine, isoleucine, and glutamate biosynthesis is diagrammed
(Figure 2).<p>

Figure 2: The interrelationships of the amino acids that inhibit the
growth of mutant A-154.<p>

Glutamate occupies a central position in the amino acid metabolism;
therefore a defect in its synthesis will be reflected in the growth of
the plants.  Since growth inhibition and relief patterns are shown by
the terminal amino acids in the diagram, feedback regulatory patterns
are operative in mutant A-154.  It is suggested that valine may affect
the activity or synthesis of one or more enzymes in the pathway common
to the synthesis of both valine and isoleucine. Growth therefore
becomes inhibited due to a shortage of the other amino acids
synthesized through this path. This is perhaps a case of a linked
pathway control. The additive inhibitory action of valine plus leucine
can be interpreted as a concerted or cooperative feedback, where
leucine and valine both act on the early enzyme(s), thus shutting off
the latter sequences of the pathway. When both valine and isoleucine
are present in the media, growth returns to normal, and this is
evidently compensatory feedback. A similar interaction of valine,
leucine, and isolucine is found in barley, and one of the inhibited
enzymes is acetolactate synthetase, the first enzyme common to the
pathways from pyruvate to valine, leucine, and isoleucine.<p>

It is not yet known which enzymes in Arabidopsis are specifically
affected by valine, leucine, and isoleucine.  It is apparent, however,
that these effects are only the expresions of a primary metabolic
lesion that has not yet been identified in mutant 405-A-154.<p>
