<h2>The TIGR <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> Database</h2>

<indent> <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>  is the most widely used plant in molecular biology, and has been adopted as the model plant for genome work. TIGR has assembled <i>Arabidopsis</i> ESTs with <i>Arabidopsis</i> transcripts into Tentative Consensus (TC) sequences and provides the results here as a service to the community. Assembly was performed using the TIGR Assembler (Sutton <i>et al.</i> (1995) Genome Science and Technology <b>1</b>:9-19)
<p>
The EST's for <i>Arabidopsis</i> come from two main sources - A multi-center lab effort in France, and a collaboration between Michigan State University and the University of Minnesota. Over 70% of the entries in dbEST come from the <B>MSU/UM</B> group.
