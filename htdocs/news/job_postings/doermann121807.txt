1. Ph.D. student
 
We are looking for a Ph.D. student to work on the biosynthesis and function of 
plant lipids. The project can start in spring 2008. The major topics will include the 
synthesis and function of plant membrane and storage lipids employing 
Arabidopsis and Lotus japonicus as model systems. State of the art facilities for 
lipid analytics will be available (HPLC, GC, GC/MS, LC/MS). Please refer to: 
Gaude, 2004, JBC 279, 34624; Kelly, 2004, COPB 7, 262; Havaux, 2005, PC 17, 
3451; Ischebeck, 2006, JBC 281, 2470; Lohmann, 2006, JBC 281, 40461; Hölzl, 
2006, PNAS 103, 7512; Gaude, 2007, PJ 49, 729. The plant lipid group will 
relocate from the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology in Golm to 
the University of Bonn in February 2008. Please send an e-mail with a short CV 
(including copies of certificates) to:
