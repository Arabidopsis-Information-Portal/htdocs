A post-doctoral position is available in Dr. Venu Reddy’s laboratory at the 
University of California, Riverside, to study the function and regulation of 
stem-cell enriched transcriptome of the shoot apical meristems of Arabidopsis 
thaliana. Our lab employs new methods of micro-genomics and live-imaging to 
study the function and regulation of stem-cell maintenance in the Arabidopsis 
shoot apical meristems. The initial appointment will be for two years with a 
possibility of extension.



Candidates with experience in Arabidopsis molecular genetics, microarray 
analysis and imaging should email their CV to: venug@ucr.edu
