Seed dormancy in Arabidopsis prevents immediate germination of
harvested seeds.  The mechanism of dormancy is not well understood.
In spite of all favourable conditions of temperature, light etc.
dormant seeds show a very low percentage of germination or may fail to
germinate entirely.  This, to a limited extent, depends on ecotype and
temperature conditions during seed development.  Following a cold
treatment of moist seeds at 2*degrees*C or below for 5-6 days, nearly
100% germination is obtained.  In one of the experiments, increased
germination was recorded following low dosages of X-irradiation.  This
led to planning an experiment to study the effect of low levels of
X-irradiation on seed dormancy.  Freshly harvested seeds of race
Landsberg, type "erecta", were used.  The results are summarised
below:<p>

Stimulatory effect of X-irradiation was marked on germination of
soaked seeds.  However, no such effect was observed on subsequent
growth of the seedlings, neither they showed any morphological
aberrations.  The doses used were very low in comparison to the LD-50
dose in the range of 30-40 kr for soaked seeds.<p>

Repression of genetic activity has been recently hypothesised as the
cause of dormancy in potato tuber buds (TUAN and BONNER 1964).
Increased germination in Arabidopsis following kinetin treatment
(MAHESHWARI and IYER 1964) suggests possibility of a similar mechanism
preventing seed germination.  Presuming that dormancy is due to some
sort of genetic repression, it is hypothesised that low levels of
irradiation may work by way of depressing the genetic activity.  This
could explain some of the controversial results on the effect of low
levels of radiations.<p>

The repression of genetic activity could be due to lack of DNA
synthesis or preventing the transfer of genetic information from the
DNA to the sites of protein synthesis through messenger RNA.  No
information on the effect of low levels of radiation on molecular
level seems to be available and this certainly appears to be worth
looking for.<p>
