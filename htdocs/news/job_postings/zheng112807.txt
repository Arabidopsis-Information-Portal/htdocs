A postdoctoral position in molecular plant cell biology is available 
immediately in the Department of Biology at McGill University, Montreal, 
Canada.  The successful applicant will join a research group studying the 
molecular mechanism of intracellular membrane trafficking on the plant 
secretory pathway.  The postdoctoral project aims to identify plant specific 
genes/factors involved in regulation of biosynthetic membrane trafficking to 
the plasma membrane, and to determine their roles in the generation of cell 
walls as well as cell and tissue morphogenesis in plants.  We are using a 
combined approach of genetics, in vivo imaging and molecular biology in the 
model plant species arabidopsis.  For more information please check

Applicants should hold a Ph.D, have expertise in molecular biology, 
genetics, and a good understanding of plant cell biology and its techniques. 
Applicants with experience studying protein-protein interactions (e.g. yeast 
2-H and TAP tag-based approaches) will be given priority.  Self motivation 
is essential.  Applications will be considered until a suitable candidate is 
identified. 
 
Applications including a cover letter, CV and names and contacts of three 
referees should be directed by email or mail to:
