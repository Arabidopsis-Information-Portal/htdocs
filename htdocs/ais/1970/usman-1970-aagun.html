It was reported earlier that at least 5 species of the genus
Arabidopsis are growing in Tadjikistan: A. Thaliana (L.) HEYNH., A.
pumila (STEPH.) N. BUSCH, A. Korschinskyi BOTSCH., A.mollissima (CAM)
N. BUSCH and A. Wallichii (HOOK et THOMS) (Figure).  All the species
are represented by various ecological forms. The ecotypes of
Arabidopsis thaliana used in the following investigations were
collected from different parts of Tadjikistan.  Several of them were
characterized by specific morphological peculiarities, others only by
physiological characteristics, some of which are indicated in the
table.  The vegetation period of the different species differed widely
but ecotypes of A. Thaliana, under the same conditions, were
characterized by a comparatively identical velocity of development.
With a saturative concentration of C02 (1%) the photosynthetic
activity of species and ecotypes was approximately similar.  But the
optimal intensity of light and the optimal temperatures for
photosynthesis were depended on the altitude of the habitat.  Species
and ecotypes from the highlands were characterized by the higher
optimal light intensity and by the lower temperature for
photosynthesis.<p>
