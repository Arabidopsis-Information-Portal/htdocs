A three-year postdoctoral position is available at the John Innes Centre 
(Norwich, UK; www.jic.ac.uk) to work on a collaborative project that aims to 
model how regulatory genes control organ development, using floral homeotic 
genes in Arabidopsis as the model system. 
 
The ideal candidate will be a developmental biologist with a strong interest 
in live imaging techniques and the ability to communicate with computer 
scientists to develop in silico models of floral organ development.  The 
successful candidate will join the group of Robert Sablowski 
(http://www.jic.ac.uk/STAFF/robert-sablowski/sablowski.htm 
<http://www.jic.ac.uk/STAFF/robert-sablowski/sablowski.htm> ) and work in 
close collaboration with the Jan Traas group (École Normale Supérieure de 
Lyon, France) for modelling at the cellular level and with the Enrico Coen 
group (JIC, Norwich) for modelling at the whole-organ level. 
 
A PhD in molecular biology, genetics or related subject is required; 
experience in plant development, genetics and computer programming are 
desirable but not essential. The candidates must be available to travel to 
international meetings and for short visits to collaborating labs abroad. 
 
To apply, please send a CV and personal statement to 
robert.sablowski@bbsrc.ac.uk, quoting job reference 1001675. The deadline 
for applications is 18 February 2008.
