	In No. 2 of this newsletter, MULLER (1965), noting the fact that no recessive lethals can be induced by 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR), points out that either the analogue had not reached the apical meristem or that an incorporation had not induced an increase of the number of recessive lethals.  In order to elucidate this alternative we used tritiated BUdR (14 mc/mM) in three kinds of treatment. First, seeds were immersed for 47 hrs 15 min in a solution of 3H-BUdR (222x105 dpm/ml) and after washing, sown on mineral medium.  The amount of the analogue uptaken was estimated at different stages of the plant development. Fig 1 shows that no significant radioactivity could be found in flowering buds or in seeds.  Secondly, 3H-BUdR (222x10E5 dpm/ml) was applied to the axils of 18 day-old plants (50 micro l pr plant in 0.1% "Tween 20") and the seeds were collected.  In this instance a certain percentage of the radioactivity appeared to be localized in the seeds.  By the same method of treatment, BROWN, BHATIA and SMITH (1965) isolated laggard plants and one of us (JACOBS, 1964) chlorophyll mutants but with a low frequency. &#160;The third mode of treatment consisted in cultivating plants on a solution containing &#158;UdR. Tritium labelled BUdR was added to the culture medium (555x10E3 dpm/ml) and in two series a definite amount of aminoptrin or fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR) was also present in the medium. A modification of the SCHMIDT-TANNHAUSER procedure (1945) was used for the extraction of the nucleic acids.<p>

	The radioactivity present in the acidosoluble (AS) and in the acidoinsoluble fractions (AIS) was measured in a Tri Carb scintillation Spectrometer. The results in Table 1 show that:<p>

(1)  Penetration and incorporation occurs throughout the vegetation cycle, but the absolute amount of incorporation is very low in the reproductive parts. This may result from a dilution of the label initially incorporated in the growing shoot by cell division in the daughter cells.  In fact, flowering buds represent a small part by weight with regard to the whole shoot.<p>

(2)  The presence of aminopterin and of FUdR, two inhibitors of pyrimidine synthesis, does not influence significantly the rate of incorporation, at least with the concentrations used. These findings suggest that BUdR can replace thymidine even in the presence of a normal pool of thymidilate.<p>

(3)  A sudden increase of incorporation versus penetration appears in growing shoots. A possible explanation for the rise of the incorporation ratio may result from the mitotic activity of the inflorescence apex.  A higher rate of DNA synthesis could explain the increased incorporation of the label.<p>

	By this last mode of treatment, we observed in F2 laggard variants of lethal and viable types. The viable phenotypes are recognizable by relatively poor growth and seed set. The frequency of the laggards in F2 varies between 5 and 11% according to the concentration used (JACOBS, in press).  Thus, from this last experiment it may be concluded that a certain amount of BUdR reached the shoot meristem and that its incorporation induced only one particular type of laggards with a high frequency and specificity. These characteristics, however, together with the behaviour of the variants in the following generations provide some presumptive evidence for an extrachromosomal basis of the product activity (JINKS, 1963).  This possiblity shall be tested in the near future.<p>
