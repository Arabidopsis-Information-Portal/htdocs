First of all I should make it clear that the results which I am using
in this talk are the work of Dr. Jane EVANS, who is now in Canada, but
I take full responsibility for any interpretation which I make and for
any opinion which I express.<p>

Mrs. Evans worked upon Arabidopsis in Leicester with me, for 3 years,
principally upon germination characteristics of seeds originating from
a number of wild populations from Britain and a few localities in W.
Europe (10.) The original collections were from at least ten plants
except where I state otherwise and multiplication of the seeds was
carried out with a minimum of selection by growing large numbers of
plants in a greenhouse.  All experiments were carried out in petri
dishes on pure paper pulp moistened with tap water.  The data is best
presented in the form of diagrams and these are shown in Figures 1 to
7.<p>

Figure 1(a) shows the distribution of Arabidopsis as a native plant in
1972, though in Japan it is probably introduced.  The wide
longitudinal range in Europe emphasises the wide range of climatic
types in which the species is found - from a Mediterranean climate in
N. Africa to a cool oceanic climate in N.W. Scandinavia.  In spite of
this wide distribution I believe that Arabidopsis maintains the same
regular life cycle wherever it is found, almost without exception. The
work of BASKIN AND BASKIN (1972) on the species in Tennessee shows
that this is so in the USA, where it is undoubtedly introduced.<p>

Perhaps this is not so difficult to understand if we consider Figure
1(b) which shows some climatic data for 3 climatic areas: both
temperature and rainfall in all 3 areas are quite similar in the
autumn and spring, the times of germinating and flowering,
respectively, of Arabidopsis.  Nevertheless, there are differences at
other times of the year and the summer period is critical for
Arabidopsis particularly in the oceanic climate of areas like Britain
where rainfall may occur at any time and soil moisture may be
temporarily high enough to permit germination at an inapproriate time,
to be followed by death when the soil dries out again.  In a true
mediterranean climate with dry soil through the summer this problem
will not exist but in N.W. European populations physiological
mechanisms which restrict germination to the early autumn period are
invariably present and it is these characteristics which I wish to
discuss and to look at their variation both between and within
populations.<p>

Figure 1(b):<p>

Figures 2(a) and (b) show the cumulative germination percentage in
continuous light at 20*degrees*C at 3 successive times after harvest
of seeds of two populations from E. Scotland. Both total % germination
and time to germination change with time so that there is a decreasing
proportion of seeds showing post-harvest dormancy as time goes on.<p>

Figure 2(c) compares the final germination percentage in continuous
light at 20*degrees*C of a number of populations tested at various
times after harvest, and a wide range of variation is evident. The
Derbyshire populations are from very well-drained soils which remain
moist only for very brief periods in the summer; the Whatton
population is from a garden near Leicester, where it may be
advantageous for reasons not connected with the climate to have a
large reserve of dormant seeds in the soil; the other poulations,
Husband's Bosworth, Dirleton, and Aberdeen, are, in that order, from
areas with an increasingly cool and moist summer climate where early
germination may be disadvantageous in all except the driest summers.<p>

Figure 3(a) shows cumulative germination % in continuous light at
20%degrees*C of seeds obtained from 20 plants of a large population
and subsequently mixed. The irregularity of the progress 'curves'
suggests considerable hetrogeneity in the physiological
characteristics of the seeds in the sample.<p>

Figure 3(b) shows similar progress curves; in this case for eight
batches of seed representative of collections from 22 individual
plants of the same population, tested separately. Note the smooth
progress of the loss of post-harvest dormancy.<p>

Figure 4(a) shows histograms of the numbers of these populations
showing a final germination percentage in the classes shown in tests
carried out at four times after harvest. The pattern suggests the
preference of three groups of plants whose seeds have different
patterns of loss of post-harvest dormancy.  Would other populations
tested in this way show similar discontinuous variation? Only further
work can answer this question.<p>

Another control of germination time in the field is the relationship
between the temperature at which seeds are capable of germinating at
various times after 'harvest' (i.e., deposition in the soil) and the
temperature of the environment, and this is complicated by whether the
seeds are in light or darkness (i.e. buried or on the surface).<p>

Figure 6 shows the final germination percentage of seeds which have
lost their post-harvest dormancy (several months after harvest), in
light and in darkness, of the Burren population and five further
populations. The differences between the populations are particularly
clear.<p>

(***One page of our original copy was misprinted, leaving us without

In the field, during the period that these physiological changes take
place, the average temperature of the environment falls as the summer
progresses, until in the autumn the temperature of the environment is
close to the optimum temperature for germination.  On the basis of the
data presented this effect would be most marked in the case of buried
seeds.<p>

The exception to these trends is the population from western Ireland,
Burren, which has from an early stage an ability to germinate at the
higher temperatures and shows an increasing ability to germinate at
the lower temperatures, with increasing seed age, especially in
darkness.  It is possible that this population, from a very oceanic
climate which may maintain moist soils throughout the summer,
germinates not in the autumn but in the spring. The original
collection of seeds was made in September which is 3 - 4 months later
than is usual anywhere else in Britain. Again only further work can
solve this problem.<p>

Obviously studies with constant temperatures are not very satisfactory
because field temperatures are very variable, particularly on a
diurnal basis. There are also continuous changes in the mean maxima
and minima as time progresses.<p>

Figure 7 shows the results from an experiment carried out in diurnally
alternating temperatures simulating the natural environment both in
'natural' day lengths (i.e. alternating light and darkness) and in
total darkness, to represent buried seeds and those on the surface.<p>

The diurnal temperature sequence to which the seeds were subjected was
derived from the mean monthly minimum and maximum temperatures of
Buxton, England, because some of the populations used originated in
that area.<p>

During the 'high' temperature period (corresponding to the Buxton mean
daily maximum temperature for a particular month) the incubator lights
were on and during the 'low' temperature period (corresponding to the
mean daily minimum temperature for the same month) the lights were
off. The length of the high temperature period was the mean day-length
of the appropriate month.<p>

Each monthly diurnal pattern was maintained in the incubator for 10
days, followed by that of the next month in chronological sequence,
starting with January. At the beginning of each 10 day period a batch
of 50 seeds from each of several populations was placed in the
incubator in clear containers.  From the August regime onwards a
second batch of 50 seeds of each population was placed in the
incubator in containers from which the light was completely excluded.
At the end of the experiment the final germination percentage was
determined. The seeds thus experienced an approximation to an
accelerated seasonal pattern of temperature and day-length.<p>

Figure 7 shows very obvious differences between seeds in darkness
('buried') and those in the light/dark alternation ('surface'), with a
very clear tendency for 'buried' seeds to germinate principally in the
autumn alternations of temperature.  This suggests a mechanism which
only operates in darkness to regulate time of germination and
indicates the importance of buried seeds in maintaining a population.
Again there are quantitative differences betwen populations, which may
reflect differences in the kind of environment which the population
occupied.<p>

So far we have been concerned with seeds which germinate in the year
in which they are produced and the factors which control the time of
germination, but one experiment emphasised the importance of dormant
seeds in the soil.  In April 1970 an area of soil 100 cm x 100 cm
within a scattered population of Arabidopsis was covered with a sheet
of strong black polythene anchored firmly with stones; this was done
before any fruits were ripe so that any seeds in the soil had been
deposited in 1969.  In April 1972 a layer of soil 1/2 cm deep, from an
area of 50 cm x 50 cm beneath the centre of the polythene sheet, was
collected and air-dried for 3 months in the laboratory. The dry soil
weighed 430 gms.  25 gms. of soil were scattered on the surface of
moist paper pulp and placed in an incubator with the Buxton September
diurnal temperature alternation: 38 seeds germinated. This is
equivalent to 2600 seeds per m2 which survived for 3 years in the soil
and there may have been more which remained dormant. The usual plant
population density of this area is less than 1 per m2.<p>

We do not know why these seeds do not germinate in September/October
1969 but the previous data in this paper have shown that in all
experiments a proportion of the seeds fails to germinate, particularly
in darkness.  Figure 4(b) shows another way in which dormancy can be
induced. Fully ripe seeds were first given a period of constant
temperature in darkness, followed by a further constant temperature
period in continuous light; the effect of the higher temperatures in
darkness is to prevent subsequent germination of a proportion of the
seeds at the higher temperatures in light; 15 days is sufficient to
induce this effect. Again there is quantitative variation from
population to population.<p>

We have also shown that burial of seeds of Arabidopsis in moist soil
to depths greater than 1.5 cm inhibits germination, probably owing to
enhanced CO2 levels as depth increases.<p>

The picture which emerges is as follows:<p>

(a) Despite the production of numerous seeds a population of
Arabidopsis may apparently be very small, but there may be a very
large number of seeds in the soil which presumably carries a large
fund of variation.<p>

(b) The seeds in the soil may originate not only from the current
year's population of Arabidopsis plants but from several previous
years.<p>

(c) The fate of the seeds formed in the current year is very varied:
they may germinate very early during a wet summer and may survive or
perish: they may avoid early germination by various mechanisms and
germinate in the autumn; they may fail to lose their post-harvest
dormancy or become secondarily dormant and survive to germinate in the
following or a subsequent year.  These possibilities will be partly
decided by whether or not the seed is buried or lies on the surface.<p>

It is impossible to say definitely whether the variation between or
within population, which has been demonstrated, has a genetic basis or
not, but figures 3(b) and 4(a) strongly suggest that this may be so.
To some extent this is irrelevant because whatever the origin of the
variability its effect will be similar: to confer on an Arabidopsis
population the potential for survival in a particular locality despite
very wide variations from day to day, month to month or year to year
in the local environment.  If indeed the variation is genetically
based it would not be surprising if they were brought about by the
strong selection caused by the very variable summer climate
experienced by the Arabidopsis populations of N.W. Europe.  It may be
(if I may speculate) that the very wide differences of soil moisture
and soil temperature, which seeds of Arabidopsis must experience in an
oceanic climate, can only be survived by a population if genetic
variability is present which confers widely different physiological
reactions on different seeds. Thus, however catastrophic the
environment for one group of seeds there will always be a large
reserve of seeds which will only germinate under quite different
conditions, and so the population will be maintained. To speculate
further, it is not impossible that the plant population of one year
may be genetically different from that of another year according to
which seed type was favoured at the time of germination in that year.
However, further work must be carried out, preferably including actual
selection, to clarify the genetic basis of differences in germination
characteristics between populations.<p>
