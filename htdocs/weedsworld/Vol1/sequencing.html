  The systematic sequencing of the Arabidopsis genome began 
last year. An EU-wide network, funded by the EC, was set up to 
sequence on a pilot scale 2 Mbp of chromosome 4 and 0.5 Mbp 
of other regions of genomic DNA. In addition, the partial 
sequencing of 3000 novel cDNAs, the development of a 
sequence Informatics Node and a contribution to the cost of 
preparing sequence-ready libraries was also funded. The 
project began last September and most labs were operational 
by the beginning of this year; therefore the time is ripe to 
provide UK scientists with both a review of progress to date 
and an idea of the future scope of this sort of work. <P>

  The largest contiguous region sequenced so far has been 16kb 
surrounding the GAP-A gene on chromosome 3. In addition to 
the GAP-A gene, 4 novel ORFs and a retrotransposon were 
identified, as well as a peculiar AT-rich tract. The density of 
genes in this area, together with the means of identifying ORFs, 
bodes well for the future of the programme; we can exect a 
gene density of 1 every 4-5kb, close to that predicted. Based on 
a genome size of 100 Mbp, this indicates a total of 20,000-
25,000 genes in Arabidopsis. Data is still coming on the large 
regions of chromosome 4, as the participating labs have had to 
learn new methods of large-scale sequencing. Regions of 
overlap between the 7 participants in this area show a high 
degree of accuracy in the independently sequenced areas, a 
necessary precondition for integrated genome activities. in the 
next 3-4 months the first year's quota of 350kb of chromosome 
4 should be completed. A detailed analysis of this region will 
provide important new information on gene density, possible 
clustering of gene families, intergenic DNA composition, and the 
sequence of novel classes of plant genes. <P>

  A sequencing project is most interesting and useful if it aims 
to complete the genome in a reasonable time. It is clear that the 
EC doesn't have the resources or the will to do the entire 
genome on its own- it is most properly a joint effort both in 
terms of the relatively large sums required and in terms of 
distributing the effort fairly. Because of this, and in view of the 
unprecedented volume of valuable information to be obtained, 
US colleagues have agreed to join the EU effort from 1995 
onwards. The EU network, once expanded mainly in the 
capacity of a few labs in the network to sequence on a 
megabase scale, will join with a US network consisting of 3-5 
major labs, and sequence 10Mb each between 1996 and 1999. 
It is hoped that the sequence of the remaining unknown areas 
of the genome, comprising about 60-70 Mb, will then be 
sequenced in the next five years, using the latest methods 
adopted from the human genome programme. The major rate-
limiting step in this plan is the provision of sequence-ready 
libraries; present cosmid coverage amounts to only 80% of the 
regions to be sequenced in the next 2 years. The increased 
effort being put into YAC coverage, particularly on 
chromosomes 4 and 5, means that YACs have to be the main 
source of sequence substrates. Because of this, new methods for 
deriving random libraries from YACs are being investigated. <P>
