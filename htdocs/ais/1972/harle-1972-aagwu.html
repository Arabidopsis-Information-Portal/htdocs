<h2> An improved method for the culture of Arabidopsis on artificial media in petriplates</h2><p>

During the course of investigations involving chemical mutagenesis,
attempts were made to employ various published methods for the culture
of Arabidopsis thaliana to maturity on soil and on agar media in
test-tubes.  Each of these methods proved to incorporate a number of
disadvantages for this kind of study.  It was difficult to sow seeds
individually on soil, and the watering of the plants frequently
resulted in accidental flooding, with the death of many individuals.
In addition, the transplanting of mutant selections proved to be
almost impossible.  In test-tube culture on agar (VELEMINSKY and
GICHNER, 1964), it was awkward to sow single seeds at the bottom of a
200 mm test-tube, and the flowers could not be reached to effect
crosspollination.  It was also hard to inspect the plants through the
curved glass of the side of the test-tube.<p>

A new method was developed which involved the culture of the plants
entirely on agar medium in petri-plates.  The method involved the use
of standard 100 x 15 mm disposable plastic petri-plates, with
additional modified lids.  This arrangement provided both for the
growth of 100 plants to the stage of flower bud appearance under the
standard lid, and for the flowering and seed setting of one or a few
plants under the modified lid.<p>

The modified lids were formed by cutting out a 70 mm hole from the
center of the 90 mm standard plastic lid.  An inverted clear plastic
drinking cup with a diameter of 75 mm and a height of 95 mm was
cemented over the open hole in the lid (Figure 1), using a cement
consisting of plexiglass shavings dissolved in carbontetrachloride
(CCl4).  In removing the center of the standard lid, it was found
necessary to use a machine designed for cutting letters in the surface
of hard plastic sheets for the making of small signs, because other
methods resulted in the shattering of the hard plastic of the
petri-plate lids.  This machine used a vertical rotating tool which
cuts thin plastic neatly and quickly, guided by a pantograph from a
template.  One person could prepare 200-300 such lids in one day by
this technique.<p>

The minimal medium was prepared according to the recipe of JACOBS
(1964), modified by the substitution of 0.06 g of Sequestrene as the
source of iron.  Sequestrene is a dry powder, a commercial preparation
of Sodium Ferric Diethylene-triamine Pentaacetate obtained from Geigy
Chemical Corp., Ardsley, N.Y., Molybdenum was supplied as (NH4)6Mo7O24.4H2O,
using 1.2 ml of a stock solution consisting of 0.50 g in 1000 ml of
water.  The quantities were adjusted to prepare 1200 ml of medium, for
40 petri-plates at 30 ml per plate.  The medium was boiled for several
minutes and then poured into presterilized disposable plastic
petri-plates.  Plates prepared in this way have proved to be very
convenient for both the growth of Arabidopsis to maturity, and for
storage at room temperature without the growth of fungi.<p>

The seeds were sterilized by immersion in 2 ml of sterilant,
consisting of equal parts absolute ethanol and 30% hydrogen peroxide,
in a small funnel with a filter cut from commercial paper hand towels.
(Laboratory filter paper disintegrated rapidly when exposed to the
sterilant.)  The seeds were picked up from the filter by a vacuum
pipette (Figure 2), consisting of a #26 hypodermic needle with the tip
ground flat, and a valve to control the suction at the tip of the
needle.  The seeds were spaced at about 1/4" on the surface of the
agar.  Seeding was carried out in a small transfer chamber sterilized
between planting periods by a U.V. sterilizing lamp.  The seeded
plates were stored overnight in a refrigerator to decrease variation
in germination times.<p>

The plants were allowed to grow at a temperature of 20-22*degrees*C
under 1500 foot-candles continuous illumination with Grolux
fluorescent lamps.  After 10-14 days flower stem elongation commenced
and the rosettes of leaves became crowded.  The plants were examined
at this time and selected individuals were transplanted by cutting out
a small square of agar which was transferred to a fresh agar plate for
further growth and seed production. The high lids described above were
used at this time in place of the standard lids.  Seed production
under these conditions was excellent, aphid infestations were
eliminated and the plants could be exposed readily for inspection and
cross-pollination.  The plants required no further maintenance prior
to harvesting.  Fungal contamination occurred rarely, usually only
when a plant died and began to disintegrate, or when the medium was
supplemented with glucose.<p>

The seeds were harvested after the agar and the plant had both dried.
The high lid was removed and the plant held above a stiff white card
while the siliques were shattered.  Separation of the ripe seeds from
unripe seeds and chaff was obtained by holding the card at a slight
angle and tapping it gently.  The round seeds rolled off and the
cleaned seed sample placed in a labelled gelatin capsule for storage.<p>

One of the significant advantages of this method was that the plants
were enclosed in the lidded petri-plates during the entire life-cycle,
protected from accidental damage, and needed no routine maintenance.<p>
