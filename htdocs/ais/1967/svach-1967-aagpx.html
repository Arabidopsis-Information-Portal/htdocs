	In No. 2 of this newsletter the authors reported about lethal chlorina mutants, some of which became greener with increasing age when fed with 2% glucose or sucrose.  Two of these chlorina mutants, one normalizing and one not normalizing on agar with sugar, were compared with regard to their content of chlorophylls (Table 1) and free amino acids.  The aim was to determine whether the content of free amino acids is influenced by the normalization.  It was already demonstrated (VELEMINSKY et al., 1965) that in cotyledons of chlorophyll-lethals grown on soil a higher amount of free amino acids, especially of amides, asparagine, and glutamine, accumulates.<p>

Table 1:  Chlorophyll content in a not normalizing (chlorina 42) and a normalizing (chlorina 1467) mutant grown on agar with 2% sucrose or glucose<p>

	The feeding with 2% glucose or sucrose enables the mutants to develop rosettes and flowers and, although differently influencing the chlorophyll synthesis, did not influence essentially the free amino acids content of both mutants in comparison to the nonfed mutants.  In the chlorina 42, where the chlorophyll content remained nearly constant at 10%, and in the chlorina 1467, where the chlorophyll content increased from about 25% in amtyledons to 50% in plants 21 days and older, the amides accumulate distinctly more than in corresponding green plants (see Table 2).<p>

Table 2:  The content of free amides (asparagine and glutamine) in the leaves of mutants grown on agar with 2% sucrose resp. glucose  <p>

	We assume that the accumulation of amides in the mutant 1467, in spite of sucrose feeding and increase of chlorophyll, indicates some instability of structural proteins or of the chlorophyll-protein complex.  The proteinic part of this complex is then steadily decomposed, which results in the high amount of free amides.  Sugar serves as a source for the synthesis of new proteins so that the higher content of chlorophyll can be maintained. This assumption is supported by the fact that the normalized mutant plants bleach after being transplanted back to a medium lacking sucrose.<p>
