INTRODUCTION<p>

On the map of chromosome 1 (Koornneef et al., 1983) the gene dw-1 is
closely linked to the gibberellin gene ga-4. Dw-1 mutants are very
short (3-4 cm) and respond to gibberellin application by a height
increase of approximately 1 cm (unpublished results).<p>

Preliminary linkage data for the gene gai, of which mutants are
insensitive to gibberellins, indicated a location of gai in the
vicinity of ga-4 and dw-1 (Koornneef et al., 1985). In this report
more information on the linkage of these three genes are presented
together with additional linkage data of some other chromosome 1
markers.<p>

This new information is combined with the previously published results
(Koornneef et al., 1983), which enables the construction of a revised
linkage map of this chromosome.<p>

MATERIAL AND METHODS<p>

All mutants, except gai, that were used in the present study and the
procedures to estimate recombination percentages from F 2 populations
are described in Koornneef et al. (1983). The genetic and
physiological description of the gai mutant has been published by
Koornneef et al. (1985).<p>

The semi-dominant nature of dw-1 and gai mutants allow the recognition
of wild type recombinants in the F 2 progenies of crosses of two dwarf
mutants that involve at least one semidominant mutant, as they are
clearly higher than the hybrid. This fraction of recombinant
phenotypes corresponds to r-(.75r^2) in case of a cross of two semi-dominant
mutants. However when one dwarf is recessive (ga-4) the fraction of
high plants (in this case wild type height) corresponds with (.5r)-(.25r^2) as
only wild type gametes combined with each other or with the recessive
mutant gamete give this phenotype.<p>

Final map distances were estimated by a computer program written by
Dr. P. Stam based on the procedures described by Jensen and Jorgensen
(1975).<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

On the basis of the phenotype of their mutants, dw-1, gai and ga-4 are
different genes affecting plant height. The sensitivity of these
mutants to applied gibberellins provides a main discriminative
property. Although responding to gibberellins the relative length
increase is comparable with that of wild type, dw-1 is not considered
to be a gibberellin sensitive mutant because in the dw-1 mutant wild
type height is far from restored by applied gibberellins as is the
case with ga mutants (Koornneef and Van der Veen, 1980).
Complementation analyses, which are complicated by the partial
dominance of dw-1 and gai mutations (Table 1) seem to confirm
non-allelism of these mutants. The heights of F 1 hybrids of dw-1 and
gai mutants with the recessive ga-4 mutant were comparable with that
of wild type x mutant F 1's (data not shown).<p>

Table 1: Final plant heights (cm) of wild type and two dwarf mutants
and their hybrids.<p>

In the F 2 of 1065 plants derived from dis-1/dis-1, Dw-1/Dw-1,
gai+/gai+ x Dis-1/Dis-1, dw-1+/dw-1+, Gai/Gai all F 2 plants higher
than the gai mutant were progeny tested. Only three of such plants
which in the F 2 had a height between 10 and 20 cm segregated wild
type plants in their F 3 lines. In all cases these recombinants had
normal trichomes (Dis-1). From these results the recombination
percentage of dw-1/gai can be estimated as 0.3 =/- 0.2 and the most
probable gene order is dis-1-dw-1-gai. In a F 2 derived from the cross
Gai/Gai, Ga-4/Ga-4, Dis-2/Dis-2 x gai +/gai+, ga-4/ga-4, dis-2/dis-2
no plants with the wild type phenotype were observed among the 588 F 2
plants tested. Therefore the position of ga-4 in relation to gai could
not be established.<p>

The very close linkage of 3 genes, all involved in the regulation of
plant height, is the first known example of clustering of genes, that
at least phenotypically are related, on the linkage map of
Arabidopsis. It should be emphasized that nothing is known about the
molecular function of the genes described except that ga-4 may be
involved in gibberellin synthesis and gai in gibberellin action. The
fact that mutants at two of the genes are semi-dominants is an
observation which is difficult to interpret in relation to the close
linkage and the function of the genes. In Arabidopsis all other dwarf
mutants tested so far, with the exception of the auxin-insensitive dwf
mutant (Mirza et al., (1984) are recessive. It can not be excluded
that the associations observed are all a matter of chance.<p>

thaliana. Brackets indicate that the order within the bracketed group
could not yet be conclusively established. The map position of the
markers as they were on previous map (KOORNNEEF et al., 1983) are
listed between parentheses.<p>

The addition of new information (Table 2) gave only minor changes,
often less than 1 cm for established markers, compared to the previous
map (Figure 1). As can be expected the position of a gene like cer-5,
for which so far as only 2 repulsion phase F 2 estimates were
available (the second dis-2/ch/1, R2 estimate in Table II of Koornneef
et al., (1983) is in fact a dis-2/cer-5 R2 estimate) changed much more
now more accurate estimates were added. Only in two cases (dw-lga-4
and tt-l/chl-3) the best fitting gene order changed. However, for
these genes both the previous and present order is not yet conclusive.
Differences with the first map were apart from the addition of new
data also due to the fact that less data had to be omitted because
they were significantly different from the ultimate estimate. From
Table II of Koornneef et al., (1983) only the an/alb estimate from
Robbelen, an/dis-1 CT and RT and th-1/dis-2 R2 had to be omitted from
the final analysis for this reason. This final analysis resulted in
the map as shown in Figure 1.<p>

SUMMARY<p>

New linkage data of chromosome 1 of Arabidopsis thaliana were combined
with previously published data to construct a revised map of 25 genes
located on this chromosome thus far. Three genes (dw-1, gai and ga-4),
all affecting plant height, were found to be very closely linked. Two
of these (dw-1 and gai) have semi-dominant mutants and two of these
genes very probably play some role in giberellin action (gai) and
gibberellin synthesis (ga-4).<p>
