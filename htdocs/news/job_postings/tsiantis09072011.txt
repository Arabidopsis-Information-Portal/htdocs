Postdoctoral Research Assistant
Evolution of leaf development at the Univ. of Oxford

Applications are invited for a three-year postdoctoral position on the
project "Pathways that limit leaflet formation in Cardamine hirsuta", led by
Professor Miltos Tsiantis. It is anticipated that the successful applicant
will start in December 2011.

The aim of the project is to understand the genetic networks that control
the number, timing and position of leaflet development in C. hirsuta; a
genetically tractable compound leafed relative of the simple leafed
reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The project builds on previous
research by the group (Hay & Tsiantis, Nature Genetics 38, 942-7; Barkoulas,
et al. Nature Genetics 40, 1136 - 41; Piazza, et al., Current Biology 20,
2223-2228; Bilsborough, et al. PNAS 108, 3424-3429) and would suit highly
motivated applicants with excellent developmental genetics skills, an
interest in the genetics of morphological diversity and the inclination to
work in a highly collaborative laboratory environment.
