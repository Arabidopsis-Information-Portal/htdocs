Single gene dwarf mutants are very useful for investigation of
gibberellin (GA) metabolism as well as of GA action in plant
development. Hitherto, the metabolism of GA has been investigated
using GA-sensitive or GA-deficient dwarf mutant of various plants such
as maize (Phinney and Spray, 1982), rice (Murakami, 1972; Suge, 1975,
1978), barley (Suge, 1983, pea (Ingram et al., 1983) and tomato
(Zeevaart, 1984). Since a number of dwarf mutants of Arabidopsis
thaliana have been isolated, the metabolic pathway of GA is expected
to be investigated also in this plant. Present work was performed to
show the active GA as well as a part of the biosynthetic pathway of GA
in A. thaliana by measuring the growth response of dwarf mutants to
nine GAs which have been found in higher plants.<p>

The seeds of three wild lines and seven dwarf mutants of A. thaliana
were sown on 0.8% agar including mineral nutrients (Redei, 1965) and
each GA (10E-5 M) in 3cm Petri dishes (30 per dish). They were allowed
to germinate and grow in a growth cabinet under continuous light by
white fluorescent tubes at roughly 10 W/m 2 at 25*degreesC for 4 days.
The hypocotyl lengths were measured with an enlarger with 0.1mm
accuracy. In mutant ga-1 and f ca ga-1 which require the application
of GA for germination (Koornneef et al., 1977; Koornneef, 1978), the
seeds were sown on the agar containing GA 3 (10E-4 M) for 24 hours
then transferred to the agar medium with each GA (10E-5M) followed by
incubation for further 3 days under the conditions same as above.<p>

Table 1: Relative activities of gibberellins on dwarf mutants and wild
lines of Arabidopsis thaliana. Hypocotyl lengths were measured after
four days incubation on agar medium containing gibberellin (10*exp*-5
M) at 25*degrees*C in the light.<p>

The result is shown in Table 1. GA 9 was the most active on the most
mutants, being followed by GA 7 and GA 4. GA 4 was particularly
effective on mutant ga-1. These three GAs were generally more active
than the other GAs on almost all mutants and lines. Koornneef and Van
der Veen (1980) have reported that GA 4+7 was the most effective among
GAs tested (GA 3, GA 7 and GA 9) on germination of many
nongerminating, GA-sensitive mutants including ga-1. GA 1 which is
active in maize (Phinney and Spray, 1982) and pea (Ingram et al.,
(1983) had no activity except for only a few lines and mutants. GA 3
which is active in barley (Suge, 1983) had middle activity. GA 5 was
active only on f ca ga-1. GA 20 which is active on tall peas, but
inactive on dwarf peas (Ingram et al., (1983) had weak activity on
wild lines and some dwarfs. GA 17 and GA 19 (both are C 20-GA with
opened lactone) were inactive on all the lines and mutants tested
here. The graded series of activities on an average on hypocotyl
growth is as follows
GA9&gt;GA7&gt;GA4&gt;GA3&gt;GA20&gt;GA1&gt;GA5&gt;GA17=GA19 but
inactive on dwarf peas<p>

Phinney and Katsumi (1982) have suggested that only the terminal GA in
biosynthetic pathway is active per se, and at the same time, they have
proposed three pathways for GA biosynthesis in plants: (1) the
nonhydroxylation pathway, in which GA 9 is terminal, (2) the
C-3-hydroxylation pathway, in which metabolic sequence of GA4 to GA7
to GA3 with GA 1 being side branch from GA 4 is suggested, and (3) the
C-13-hydroxylation pathway, in which the steps GA19 to GA20 to GA1 are
presumed. Based on their hypothesis, the terminal GA in A. thaliana
may be GA 9 or GA 7 or GA 4. Moreover, two in the three pathways,
i.e., (1) and (2), may potentially be present. Mutant st 1 and g may
have a block in the pathway between GA 4 and GA 7 because both the
mutants responded markedly to GA 7, but did not to GA 4. Mutant t may
have a block before GA 4 step, because it responded more markedly to
both GA 4 and GA 7 than to other GAs (except for GA 9). Mutant le
which exhibits the most dwarf phenotype scarcely responded to any of
GAs tested here, suggesting that the hypocotyl of this mutant has a
partial block in the utilization of GAs.<p>

Estland responded to most GAs, but Landsberg weakly responded only to
few GAs, suggesting that the utilization system of GAs is different
among wild lines. Mutant ga-4 did not respond markedly to any of GAs
tested here. Since this mtuant requires repeated spray of GA for
development to the phenotype similar to wild line, the ability to
respond to GAs may be gained at the later stages of development. Organ
specificity of GA production has been demonstrated in pea (Ingram et
al., 1983); GA 1 was found in apical region of shoots, but not in
developing seeds. Similarly, the responsiveness to GAs may change
every moment throughout developmental stages in plant life cycle.<p>
