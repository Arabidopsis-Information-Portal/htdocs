A 2-year postdoctoral position is available to work on a variety of
projects, including SSR development and genetic mapping in switchgrass,
anchoring of wheat fingerprint contigs to the genetic map and the cloning
and sequencing of transgene insertion sites in wheat.  A strong background
in molecular genetics is required and applicants must be available for
interview.  The successful candidate will join a dynamic laboratory that
focuses on wheat and switchgrass genetics.  Salary will be commensurate with
appropriate experience. Parties interested in the position should send a
Curriculum Vitae, including the names and contact information for at least
three individuals who can provide recommendations, to Katrien Devos, Dept.
of Crop and Soil Sciences and Dept. of Plant Biology, University of Georgia,
