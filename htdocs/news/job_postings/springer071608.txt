A full time postdoctoral associate position is available immediately in the laboratory of 
Patricia Springer, Department of Botany and Plant Sciences, University of California, 
Riverside.  The successful candidate will examine the role of individual members of the 
LOB-Domain (LBD) family of transcription factors in Arabidopsis development.  This 
family of transcription factors has been implicated in a number of different 
developmental processes in plants, including the control of organ boundaries, adaxial-
abaxial organ polarity, lateral root initiation, gametophyte development, and 
inflorescence branching.  We seek to understand the functions of additional genes in this 
family. For more information about the available projects, contact Patricia Springer 
(pspringer@ucr.edu). 
 
A Ph.D. degree in molecular genetics, plant biology, or a related field is required. 
 Candidates must have excellent communication skills. Interested applicants should send 
a C.V., list of publications, brief summary of research experience and future goals, and 
names and addresses of three referees by email to Patricia Springer (pspringer@ucr.edu). 
 Review of applications will begin immediately and continue until position is filled. For 
further information on the lab interests, please see
