Vol 01S: <h2>Theory of Vernalization - New Experiments with Arabidopsis</h2><p>

K. NAPP-ZINN<p>

During the last few months or years, I have sometimes been asked, what
is the matter with that scheme of vernalization in Arabidopsis that
you had developed in 1953 and to which you have given some more
precision later on? This is the reason for which I have chosen this
subject for my contribution.<p>

The essential of that scheme is the assumption that there might be
some thermostable intermediate product in the process of vernalization
(or in the formation of something like a flowering hormone), which is
preceeded and followed by at least two thermo-unstable phases.<p>

1*degree*C and darkness) as related to age of plants at beginning of
cold treatment (after NAPP-ZINN, 1960)<p>

I do not want to repeat the description of those experiments which had
led to this scheme. I should only mention that one might expect that
the strain Stockholm, on the behaviour of which this scheme had been
based, should differ for summer annual strains (which do not have a
requirement for vernalization) by more than one gene, that means, in
this simplified form, a difference with regard to at least two
"vernalization genes" each for which should be responsible for the
destruction of one thermo-unstable intermediate stage at relatively
high temperatures (i.e., temperatures above approximately
20*degrees*C). In fact, it has been found, that there are several
"vernalization genes" in the strain Stockholm, each of which is
responsible for a certain vernalization requirement.<p>

Now I should like to speak about two kinds of experiments which have
been done with regard to that scheme. There is one contradiction
between the vernalization scheme of PURVIS and GREGORY (1952) on the
one hand and this one on the other. According to the hypothesis of
PURVIS and GREGORY a thermo-unstable intermediate product should be
reverted to the precursor by devernalization), while according to my
scheme some thermo-unstable product should be destroyed, or at least
converted to a substance which is not identical with the precursor.<p>

How to test these two different hypotheses? It had been found already
several years ago, that in the development of the winter annual
Arabidopsis race Stockholm there is one phase in which a certain
vernalization treatment has only a small effect, while at earlier
stages as well as at later ones, the same vernalization treatment has
a much greater effect, as may be shown by Figure 1: The vernalization
effect is great at the seed stage, very small at an age of
approximately 6 or 7 days, and afterwards it increases again. This
observation could be easily explained by the above scheme: One could
imagine that at the age of 6-7 days the process going on in a plant is
just in the thermostable phase, where vernalization should not have a
big effect, while during thermo-unstable (cold requiring) phases the
effect should be much greater. Now I have vernalized seeds of the
strain Stockholm for the same period and the same temperature (e.g.,
60 days at +2*degrees*C).  Then all have been devernalized by the same
treatment (e.g., 5 days at +30*degrees*C) immediately afterwards, and
then different periods (at 20*degrees*C) passed until the beginning of
revernalization (e.g., 40 days at +2*degrees*C). If then the plants
would behave after revernalization, as if they had not been vernalized
and devernalized before, one could assume, that the first unstable
phase had been reverted to the precursor. If the plants, however,
would behave in another way, probably the thermo-unstable intermediate
product will not have been reverted to the precursor. The result,
however, was neither "yes" nor "no", but rather between: In fact,
there is a minimum phase of revernalizibility after vernalization and
devernalization, but this minimum phase is not identical with that of
plants which had not been vernalized and devernalized before, the
period of minimal revernalizibility is approximately at 16 days after
the end of devernalization (Figure 2). That is the one kind of
experiments.<p>

The other kind: I have said, if there are thermo-unstable stages
before and after the stable stage, there must be several genes, each
of which is responsible for the existence of a thermo-unstable stage.
Now, how do Arabidopsis lines behave which have only one gene causing
a cold requirement? For many years all the strains with only
"vernalization gene", showed a curve more or less similar to Figure 3.
That means, the vernalizibility remained constant or increased, but
normally did not show a minimum some days after germination.<p>

Figure 2: Race Stockholm. Flowering after vernalization (60 days at
+2*degrees*C and darkness), followed by immediate devernalization (5
days at +30*degrees*C and darkness), and revernalization (40 days at
+2*degrees*C) at different times after devernalization. Between
devernalization and revernalization, the plants had been kept at
20*degrees*C and under continuous light (approximately 4000 Lux). Low
column at right: plants only vernalized (days to flowering from end of
vernalization); high column: plants only vernalized and devernalized
(days to flowering from end of devernalization).<p>

+3+/-2*degrees*C and darkness) as related to age of plants at the
beginning of the cold treatment (after NAPP-ZINN 1960)<p>

All seemed to be right, but at first there was apparently one
exception: one strain, H53, behaved similar to Stockholm (Figure 4).
Genetical analysis of this strain, however, showed, that it contained
at least two vernalization genes. More recently, I did another
experiment of this kind with one of McKELVIE's mutants, about which
Prof. LAIBACH has already spoken this morning, the only mutant which
is known to be dominant (while all the other mutants proved to be
recessive) and which had been named "Florens" or "F". This mutant F
has a very great cold requirement, similar to that of Stockholm. And I
must say that this mutant F behaved very similar to Stockholm also
with regard to the relation between vernalization effect and age
(Figure 5). There are two explanations for this phenomenon: Either the
hypothesis is wrong, or there might have been two mutations in the
same chromosome responsible for this behaviour, probably very closely
neighboured.<p>

treatment) and vernalization effect in "Florens" (F) as compared with
"Stockholm" (St.). N.B. The experiments represented in figs. 1-5 have
not been done under strictly identical conditions. Further details
will be given elsewhere.<p>

Well, I am not married with this scheme, which, from the beginning,
could only be regarded as a working hypothesis. In any case, I wanted
to show some more phenomena for which this scheme fits, and some
others for which it does not without some additional hypotheses.<p>

Discussion:<p>

Van der VEEN: How do you identify these genes for vernalization
requirement or response? Are they always reflected by flowring time
differences under normal conditions?<p>

NAPP-ZINN: Of course, the analysis of such so-called vernalization
genes is done under so-called normal conditions in greenhouses, that
means under relatively high temperature; plants without vernalization
requirements flower early and such with vernalization requirement
flower late.<p>

Van der VEEN: "Stockholm" contains one, two or three genes?<p>

NAPP-ZINN: Probably at least four vernalization genes (or genes for
late flowering).<p>

REDEI: Is it possible to separate the individual genes? What is the
variation in the expression of these genes?<p>

NAPP-ZINN: This is very different. Even plants with the same genetical
constitution may vary very much with regard to the date of flowering
and the number of leaves. The later the plants with a certain genetic
constitution flower, the greater is the variability.<p>

REDEI: Is there much overlapping in the variation range?<p>

NAPP-ZINN: Yes, it is! In the race Stockholm which I used in this
work, there are at least two dominant genes, each of which causes a
certain vernalization requirement. Perhaps one of these dominant genes
might be identical with the so-called "florens" gene of McKELVIE. If
it is only one gene!<p>

Van der VEEN: I crossed it! It is probably not identical with the one
of the genes of "Stockholm".<p>

NAPP-ZINN: Then there is one very strong gene in "Stockholm" with an
effect very similar to "Florens" at least, i.e., the age of flowering
is very similar to that of "Florens" plants. Another dominant
vernalization gene is less effective; and then there is at least one
recessive gene, that means the recessive allele causes this
vernalization requirement. As to the fourth gene I don't yet dare to
say much about.<p>

REDEI: Are these genes completely dominant or recessive or more or
less dominant?<p>

NAPP-ZINN: Probably more or less dominant. In any case the strain of
Stockholm contains simultaneously dominant and recessive genes for
vernalization requirement (or for late flowering).<p>

REDEI: Did you find the same genes in other ecotypes, e.g., the same
recessive gene, which is contained in "Stockholm"?<p>

NAPP-ZINN: I did not do such work until now, but only the genetical
analysis of the strain Stockholm. You know that takes very much time
and space.<p>

KRANZ: Hat man schon einmal eine Kreuzung durchgefuhrt ziwischen
"Florens" und "Stockholm" oder anderen Rassen?<p>

NAPP-ZINN: Auser den eben von Van der VEEN erwahnten Versuchen, nach
denen das Gen "Florens" nicht in "Stockholm" vorkommt, sind mir keine
weiteren Ergebnisse bekannt.<p>

FEENSTRA: Did you separate the two dominant genes of "Stockholm"?
Separation should give you the response more clearly.<p>

NAPP-ZINN: I have done vernalization experiments with only one of
these two dominant genes, while I have not yet done experiments with
the stronger one of these two dominant genes, which I had believed to
be identical with "Florens", what, however, is not the case. Indeed
this question is very important and the correspondent experiment
should be done.<p>

REDEI: How do you distinguish that these two dominant genes are not
identical?<p>

Van der VEEN: I think that might be clear from my following lecture,
which is a contribution to this question.<p>
