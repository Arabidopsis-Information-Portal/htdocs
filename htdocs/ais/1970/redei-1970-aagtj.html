In the western hemisphere, A. thaliana has been reported from
relatively limited areas.  The plant seems to be most common in the
northeast and midwest regions of the United States (BECK, 1833;
CHAPMAN, 1883; GRAY, 1895-97; SMALL, 1913; BRITTON and BROWN, 1913;
RYDBERG, 1932; RICKETT, 1967).  Most taxonomists agree that it was
introduced originally from Europe, while MACOUN (1883) in view of the
abundance of the species in the region of the Great Lakes believed
that A. thaliana is indigenous to America.  Floras of PURSH (1814) and
NUTTALL (1818) describe Arabidopsis in the area extending from New
England to the Virginias.  The early botany of Vermont (GROUT, 1898)
did not mention A. thaliana, while according to DOLE, WEATHERBY,
CARPENTER and KITTREDGE (1937), it could be found along the Wells
River in that State.  BIGELOW (1924) did not mention it in the Florula
Bostoniensis.  According to GLEASON (1962) it can be found in the
vicinity of the New York City.  Several reports are available on the
occurrence of the plant in different locations in Pennsylvania
(TWINING, 1917; BRENNER, 1932; WAGNER, 1943).  In Maryland (REDMOND,
1932) and in the Carolinas (BATESON, 1964; MATZINGER, 1963 personal
communiction), Arabidopsis was not uncommon.  I did not find any
report on this plant from the parts of the states of Florida,
Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas bordering on the Gulf of Mexico.  It
was widely scattered over the state of Alabama (MOHR, 1901).  Several
authors mentioned A. thaliana in Georgia (CHAPMAN, 1883; RADFORD,
AHLES and BELL, 1964).  No specific locations were mentioned in Ohio
where A thaliana occurs.  It is apparently frequent in most parts of
West Virginia, Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee (CORE, McNEILL,
BARNETT, HALE AMMONS and BEAR, 1960; REDFORD, AHLES and BELL, 1964).<p>

In the midwest Arabidopsis could be found in several localities in
Illinois (PEPOON, 1927; JONES, 1945; MOHLENBROCK and VOIGT, 1959), in
Indiana (DEAM, 1940) and in Iowa (GREENE, 1907).  In the state of
Missouri the numerous locations of the habitats of Arabidopsis are
excellently mapped (DANIELS, 1907; PALMER and STEYERMARK, 1935;
STEYERMARK, 1963; HENDERSON, 1967 personal communication). The
"Columbia wild type" of our laboratory was not extracted from wild
populations of the area of Columbia, Missouri.  It was selected from
the Landsberg ecotype, provided to me by Professor LAIBACH.  Within
the city limits of Columbia, Missouri, wild populations of Arabidopsis
have not yet been found and the escapees from our cultures rarely
survived the second year outside the greenhouse.<p>

Arkansas (DEAM, 1940) and Oklahoma (WATERFALL, 1952) apparently had A.
thaliana growing while Central Texas was apparently free of the plant
(COULTER, 1891-94; SHINNERS, 1958; IRWIN, 1961).<p>

In the West, Kansas (GATES, 1940) and Utah (RYDBERG, 1932) were A.
thaliana habitats but from Colorado (RYDBERG, 1906; HARRINGTON, 1954;
WEBER, 1961) Arizona (KEARNEY, PEEBLES, HOWELL and McCLINTOCK, 1960),
New Mexico (WOOTON and STANDLEY, 1915) no reports were available on
the plant.  In California there was apparently no A thaliana in the
south or in the desert areas (COVILLE, 1893; DAVIDSON and MOXLEY,
1923; THOMAS, 1961) or in the Sierra Nevada foothills (MUNZ, 1961).
An old Flora of the San Francisco Bay area (GREENE, 1894) did not list
this plant; the newer Flora of MUNZ and KECK (1959) indicated its
presence in the vicinity of the Bay.  Oregon (PECK, 1941), Washington
(ABRAMS, 1944), and Idaho (DAVIS, 1952) had this plant growing only
sparsely.<p>

In North Central United States, it has been reported in the area of
the Great Lakes in Michigan (HANES and HANES, 1947), Wisconsin
(RICKETT, 1967), and Minnesota (MacMILLAN, 1892; BRITTON and BROWN,
1913; SMALL, 1913).  The recent handbook of the North Dakota plants by
STEVENS (1963) did not list A. thaliana however.<p>

Seemingly A thaliana did not spread northward from the Great Lakes
into Canada; it was not listed in the Botanical Survey of the Lawrence
Seaway area (DORE and GILLETT, 1955).  The several Alaskan Floras
consulted failed to provide any evidence on the occurrence of A.
thaliana in these northern aras, continental or islandic, though
numerous crucifers and even A. millis (A. hookeri) were reported there
(ANDERSON, 1959; HULTEN, 1960; WIGGINS and THOMAS, 1962).<p>

There was no evidence for the occurrence of A. thaliana from Mexico
(LONGWORTH, 1942), from the Panama Canal Zone (STANDLEY, 1928), from
the Bahamas (GRISEBACH, 1864; BRITTON and MILLSPAUCH, 1962), from the
Antilles (BOLDINGH, 1909), or from the Barbados (GOODING and LOVELESS,
1965).<p>

The Floras of Ecuador (DIELS, 1937), Chile (MUNOZ, 1959) the old
monumental work on Brazil by MARTIUS and EICHLER (1841-1872) or
CABRERA's Flora on Argentina did not indicate the presence of A.
thaliana in Middle or South America.<p>
