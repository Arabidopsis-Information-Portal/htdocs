In the last two years seed of more than 60 local populations of
Arabidopsis thaliana have been collected from various localities.  The
plants from post-dormancy seed were grown at 25+3*degrees*C in
continuous illumination (1250 lux), i.e., in the conditions which
induce flowering in spring types only and inhibit it in winter ones.
The experiments were finished after 42 days from full germination.
The percentage of generative (=spring) plants was determined at the
same time.<p>

The distribution of spring types has been found in the first part of
the whole material (32 populations) as follows:<p>

Thus, the majority of the populations (78%) were of spring or winter
type with a small portion of individuals of the opposite type, while
only 22% populations were mixed.<p>

A confrontation with the geographical-climatic conditions shows that
the boundary between the localities with spring and winter types
corresponds to the limit of the range of the xerotherm vegetation: in
the more warm and dry lowland we find the winter populations, in the
more cold and wet highland the spring ones.  The mixed populations
occur in the boundary localities.<p>
