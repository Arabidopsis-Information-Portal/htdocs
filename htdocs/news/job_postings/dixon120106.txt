currently advertising 4 lectureships as part of an exciting new
development within the School, leading up to the formation of a
multi-million pound new Institute of Life Sciences at Southampton. The
posts are across a broad range of research areas and applications from
plant biologists are strongly encouraged. With the new developments
there is great potential for interaction with those working in the life
sciences and in other disciplines.
