A postdoctoral position is available in the Department of Plant Biology at 
Cornell University to study molecular mechanisms by which plant defense 
responses are modulated by genetic repressors and temperature in 
Arabidopsis. The postdoc will investigate how the Arabidopsis BON1 and BAP1 
genes negatively regulate disease resistance genes at the molecular and 
biochemical level. Applicants should have a Ph D with strong background in 
biochemistry, molecular biology, and genetics. Research experience in plant 
pathogen interaction is a plus. Applicant should send a letter of intent, a 
CV, and contact information of three references to Dr. Jian Hua via email 
(jh299@cornell.edu).
