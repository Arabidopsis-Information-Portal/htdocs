	Differences in radio-resistance of seed germination in dependence on locality were found in Andropogon by MEWISSEN et al. (1959).  KHVOSTOVA and NEVZGODINA (1960) showed considerable differences in radio-resistance of pea varieties.  In an earlier communication (KUCERA, 1966) it was demonstrated that in Arabidopsis the radio-resistance of germination depends on the temperature and that its modification by chemicals is possible. The present report deals with further experiments on these relations between radio-resistance of germination and temperature.<p>

	Seeds of 18 populations from the collection of this Department (cf. CETL, 1965) were chosen for the experiment. Dry seeds were irradiated with gamma-rays (60Co, 72 kR and 144 kR).  The germination at 20*degrees*C in Petri-dishes was evaluated on the 7th day.  Parallel tests were run without irradiation but with germination temperatures of 20*degrees*C and 30*degrees*C, respectively.  There were 3 x 50 seeds in each variant. The relative values for the germination at 30*degrees*C (compared to 20*degrees*C) indicate the thermo-resistance and those for the irradiated samples the radio-resistance of the germination.<p>

	As can be seen from the table, there were large differences in the germination of the different populations by the higher temperature as well as by the gamma-irradiation.  The most striking observation, however, was that those populations with an increasing germination percentage at 30*degrees*C showed the lowest germination values after irradiation.  The radio-resistance and the thermo-resistance of seed germination were inversely proportional to each other with a significant negative correlation coefficient (r+/- 3.sr = -0.84+/- 3.0.01; P<0.01-for 72 kR).<p>
