Generally, the Arabidopsis seed is covered by a mucilage layer
immediately after imbibition. This mucilage is secreted from a
cylindrical structure which is situated on the central region of each
testa cell (Koornneef, 1981; Goto, 1982).<p>

The present paper describes some charactristics of the mucilage
investigated with the gel and gas chromatographic analyses.<p>

Seeds (Arabidopsis thaliana, wild line Sendai, 30 g) were stirred in
0.2% ammonium oxalate (300 ml) at room temperature for 1 h. After
centrifugation (1.3 x 10 4 g, 20 min) the extract was poured into 5
volumes of ethanol, and centrifuged (2.3 x 10 3 g, 20 min). The
precipitate was dissolved in water, followed by dialysis against
running water. A white filmy material (0.56 g) was obtained after
lyophilization. The mucilage sample was analyzed by gh phenol-sulfuric
acid method for polysaccharides using rhamnose as a standard, and by
the calbazole-sulfuric acid method and thin layer chromatography for
uronic acids using galacturonic acid as a standard. The analysis and
calculation of the water dissolved sample revealed that neutral sugars
accounted for 29 mg in 100 mg dry mucilage.<p>

The sample (10 mg) was dissolved in 10 ml Tris/HC1 buffer (0.1 M, pH
7.7) and applied to a column (2.5 x 35 cm) of Sepharose 4B. Elution (7
ml/h) was carried out but the ascending method with the Tris-HC1.
Fraction of 3.2 ml was collected and the polysaccharide was asayed
(Figure 1). The gel filtration profile revealed that the mucilage was
composed of homogeneous polysacchride, being greater than 2 x 10 6 in
molecular weight. Tubes 15 to 25 in the Sepharose 4B elution were
combined and dialzyed against water. This sample was hydrolyzed with
trifluoroacetic acid (final concentration was adjusted to 2 N) in a
sealed tube at 120*degrees*C for 1 h. The hydrolysate was vacuum dried
at 40*degrees*C and dissolved in water (1 ml).<p>

Figure 1: Gel chromatography of the mucilage polysaccharide extracted
from testa of Arabidopsis thaliana. The sample was applied to a column
of Sepharose 4B and each fraction was assayed by the phenol-sulfuric
acid method. Dextran markers (molecular weight): Vo, Blue dextran ( 2
x 10 6); T-500, Dextran T-500 (5 x 10 5).<p>

The neutral sugars were converted into their corresponding alditol
trifluoroacetates according to the method of IMANARI et al. (1969).
Gas chromatography was carried out with a Hitachi 163 gas
chromatograph equipped with a hydrogen flame ionization detector. The
glass column (200 x 0.3 cm) was packed with 1.5% QF-1 on Chromosorb W
(AW-DMCS) (60-80 mesh). The analysis was performed at 130*degrees*C at
nitrogen flow rate of 30 ml/min. Table 1 shows the result of gas
chromatographic analysis of neutral sugar composition. The mucilage
polysaccharide consisted mainly of rhamnose although six other and one
unknown monosaccharide were contained in lower ratios.<p>

Table 1: Neutral sugar composition (mol %) of the mucilage
polysaccharide obtained by gel chromatography on Sepharose 4B.<p>

From these data the mucilage in the testa seems to be composed of a
pectic substance, having mainly rhamnose as the neutral sugar.<p>
