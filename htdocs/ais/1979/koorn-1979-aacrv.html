INTRODUCTION<p>

Among eukaryotes, fungi with their high "resolving power" have proved
ideal tools for analysing the genetical fine structure of loci by
means of complementation and recombination analysis (for reviews see
Catcheside, 1977; Fincham et al., 1979).<p>

Studies in Drosophila led to qualitatively comparable results
(Carlson, 1971). Fine structure analyses in higher plants are almost
absent, except for some studies in Zea mays e.g.:<p>

a. Nelson (1962, 1968) analysed the waxy (wx) locus, for which very
large numbers of pollen grains can be easily scored. For
pollen-genotypes no outside markers are available. However, Nelson
(1962) could make use, in a cross between two alleles, of their
differential expression in the endosperm.<p>

b. Salamini and Lorenzoni (1970) studied the glossy (gl-1) locus,
which implied growing very large numbers of seedlings.<p>

For fine structure analysis (and also for detection of induced
revertants) our nongerminating (NG), GA sensitive mutants of
Arabidopsis (Koornneef, et al., 1977; Koornneef, 1978) seem
particularly suitable. For germination, these mutants require
gibberellins and without further addition of GA they develop into
typical dwarfs, but with GA sprays at weekly intervals, they obtain
the wildtype habitus or nearly so. Depending on the allele and on
environmental circumstances, varying degrees of germination occur
without GA ("leakiness"). However, subsequently these germinators
develop into dwarfs. Although wildtype gives much more vigorous
seedlings (Figure 1), in cases of doubt the dwarf vs. non-dwarf
contrast gives a welcome cheque for delimiting wildtypes arising from
complementation, reversion (spontaneous or induced) or intragenic
recombination (and also of course inadvertent outcrossing and seed
admixture).<p>

EMS was at 10 mM during 24 hours at 24*degrees*C, fast neutron mutants
were kindly provided by Dellaert (cf. this AIS-volume), who in case of
67 Gy fast neutrons used the radioprotector dithiotreitol (DTT).<p>

The suitability of the ga system for intragenic analysis, a.o. its
high resolving power, derives from the following aspects:<p>

1. Recombinants (wildtype) can be identified with certainty, as said
above.<p>

2,. So far no less than 30 independently induced mutant alleles are
available at the ga-1 locus and resp. 9 and 6 at the ga-2 and ga-3
locus.<p>

3. Even mutant plants produce as many as 6000 seeds.<p>

4. A single 10 cm petridish provides sufficient space for about 1000
seeds.<p>

5. In principle it will be possible to find closely linked outside
markers.<p>

In the present preliminary study, 7 arbitrary chosen
(non-complementing) mutants of ga-1 locus were analysed in an
incomplete diallel.<p>

The position of ga-1 locus on the chromosome (as far as known now at
the end of chromosome 4; closest marker is f ca at 30 +/- 5 cM) makes
it at the moment less suitable for studying the outside marker
distribution than the loci ga-2 (chromosome 1) and ga-3 (chromosome
5).<p>

MATERIAL AND METHODS<p>

Table 1 lists the 7 ga-1 mutants and the test results. For method of
crossing see Feenstra (1965). Seeds were sown in petridishes on
perlite with mineral solution, which are put at 5*degrees*C during 4
days (to break dormancy) and then transferred to a climate room at
25*degrees*C under continuous fluorescent light. After a few days (to
cheque for wildtype contaminants) GA (10E-5M) was added to the F1
seeds to induce complete germination. F1 seedlings were transplanted
to an isolated climate chamber (to exclude unwanted
cross-fertilization). Here T = 23*degrees*C, rel. hum. about 80% and
continuous light was by TL 33 fluorescent tubes (15 W/m2) with
incandescent bulbs (5 W/m2) providing a spectrum with sufficient far
red.<p>

Two weeks later (dwarf genotypes clearly visible) GA 4+7 (10E-4M) was
sprayed at weekly intervals (in total 3 times). F2 seeds were
harvested and sown separately per F1 plant, which is necessary since
any deviation from random distribution of wildtyupe F2 descendents
(recombinants) over F1-plants is suspect and should not escape
detection. F2 seeds were sown at about 100 seeds per petridish.
"Counting" of these was on the basis of 100 seed weight of a number of
samples from each separate F2.<p>

confidence intervals (see Table 2).<p>

Eight days after transfer to the climateroom (25*degrees*C, wildtype
seedings were scored and subsequently chequed for non-dwarfiness in
the greenhouse.<p>

Since the intragenic recombinant gametes are rare, and only half of
them are (dominant) wildtypes, the proportion of F2 wildtypes is a
direct estimate of the recombinant fraction (r).<p>

When calculating the 5% confidence limits, a Poisson distribution is
assumed.<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

The results of a small preliminary experiment (Exp. I; number of seeds
up to 12.000 pr F2) are combined with those of the much larger Exp.
II. No spontaneous revertants were found in the parent line (Table 1),
so the reversion rate seems negligible.<p>

As no significant differences were found in the results of F2's from
duplicate crosses or reciprocal crosses, Table 2 gives the pooled
counts per F2-type. Within F2's the distribution of wildtypes per F1
plants did not deviate from randomness (Poisson).<p>

Though it seems a remote possibility, it cannot be excluded that some
unwanted selfing occurred when crossing to make the F1's (no line
specific markers were used). This would result in underestimation of
the recombinant fractions. The estimated recombinant fractions (Table
2) are of the same order of magnitude as found for the wx locus (up to
180 x 10E-5; Nelson 1968) and the gl-1 locus in maize (up to 120 x
10E-5; Salamini and Lorenzoni, 1970).<p>

Five mutants (NG 4, NG 5, Bo27, A428 and 29.9) showed recombinants in
all crosses among each other, i.e., behave like "points mutants". They
can be arranged in a linear map (Figure 2), which internally is fully
consistent.<p>

The two mutants 31,80 and 6.59 behaved differently, as they showed no
recombinants with several of the former five. The fact that their non
recombination and recombination fits with the linear order of these
five, stongly suggests that they contain intragenic delecitons (Table
3). Because 6.59 and 31.89 seem to overlap; recombinants are not
expected in their F2, which is confirmed by the results (Table 2). It
is significant that both mtuants have the lowest "spontaneous
germination" (Table 1), i.e., are hardly or not leaky, as expected
from deletions. Besides both mtuants have been obtained by fast
neutrons which ae expected to ferquently induce chromosomal
aberrations a.o. small deletions, such in contrast to the aklylating
agent EMS.<p>

For further comments on the mechanism by which the wildtype
"recombinants" arise (classical crossing over, gene-conversion)
outside markers are needed. As said before, the loci ga-2 and ga-3
have better prospects for this.<p>
