<h2>Radiation induced mutants showing changed inflorescence characteristics</h2><p>

	The many mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana (race Enkheim) produced up to now predominantly show alterations of charactristics within the vegetative region.  In my earlier mutation experiments I found only one form, the mutant seminosa, with a remarkably changed morphology of siliques (REINHOLZ, 1947)<p>

	Recently, ARNOLD (1965) and ROBBELEN (1965) described some new inflorescence-mutants, one fertile and 3 sterile types.  New investigations (REINHOLZ, 1965a) performed in order to test the influence of the temperature during irradiation of air-dried seeds on the mutation rate, gave rise to 2 new heritable variants for the inflorescence region.<p>

1.  Mutant fasciata (No. -10*degrees*C 242): This mutant exhibiting a multifoliaceous rosette and a fasciated stem has already been described (REINHOLZ, 1965b).  The tendency to multiple organs is also expressed in each individual silique implying a new constant, heritable characteristic.<p>

	The numerous, short, thick, multiseminal and often crooked fruits of the strong plant have a cucumber-like appearance (upper part of Figure 1) accompanied with a changed structure (lower part of Figure 1).  In contrary to the two-fan-shaped regular-slender silique of the standard form, the mutant shows quadripartite blown-up fruits with a small and pointed base, and four placentar carinae.  The latter are closely connected at the base of the fruit by the septae and an axillary tissue ending freely in the fruit part presenting a papillae-bearing stigma-tissue.  In the upper part, below the pistil, where only small septal strips exist, the placentar carinae are bent apart.  In accordance to the shape of the fruit, the four valvae at the pistil side are strongly enlarged.<p>

2.  Mutant digitata (no. -10*degrees*C 286):  This vegetative normal mutant begins to shoot and to blossom a bit earlier than the standard type. But the growth-inhibited end-florescence is soon exhausted and the enrichment shoots put forth.  These conflorescences form long-petioled individual siliques out of the axils of the bracts and umbels of two or more siliques (see Figure 2) more or less without any petiole, situated at the top of the shoots.  Sometimes growth-inhibited malformed or three-fan-shaped siliques are to be found.  On account of the high fertility of both mutants and of the complete penetrance and constant expressivity of the inflorescence-characteristics differing from the norm, the two mutated genes are expected to be good markers.<p>
