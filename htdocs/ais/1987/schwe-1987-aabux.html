The objective of the following considerations is to discuss different
approaches for establishing the relationship between the karyotype of
Arabidopsis thaliana (Ambros and Schweizer, 1976) and the genetic map
(Koornneef et al., 1983). Some preliminary results are reported.<p>

Despite its relatively low chromosome number (2n=2x=10) A. thaliana by
far is not a favourable material for cytogenetic analyses because it
has a very small genome comprising some 70 000 to 200 000 kbp (1C
value) and hence also very small chromosomes; the 1C value is the DNA
content of the haploid genome at G1 phase (for the nuclear DNA content
of A. thaliana see Bennett and Smith 1976, Van't Hof et al. 1978,
Leutwiler et al. 1984).<p>

Classical cytological methods did not provide a clear picture of the
karyomorphology of A. thaliana (Mesicek, 1967) and also the
cytological characterization of trisomic plants by the study of
meiotic chromosomes was of limited use (Sears and Lee Chen, 1970). An
improvement may be achieved by the so called surface spreading
technique for demonstrating synaptonemal complexes. This technique
would allow a much more accurate determination of relative chromosome
lengths, centromere position and of meiotic pairing (see Loidl and
Jones, 1986; Loidl, 1987).<p>

Earlier, we have applied the Giemsa C-banding method for staining
constitutive heterochromatin to A. thaliana so as to describe the
somatic metaphase chromosomes by their individual morphology and
C-band pattern. A quantitative C-band karyotype has been presented
(Ambros and Schweizer, 1976; cp. Figure 1 and 2). Applying this
approach also to a primary trisomic (AIS Accession No. 828) it was
demonstrated that the cytological identification of trisomics is
feasible and that it is possible to associate among trisomics each
phenotypic group with trisomy for a particular chromosome.<p>

Figure 1: Giemsa C-banded karyogram of A. thaliana showing the
distribution of heterochromatin (hatched) and the location of the
nucleolus organizer region (NOR). Centromeric and NOR C-band
polymorphisms do occur but are not indicated; variable, weakly
expressed terminal bands are designated 'var'. Chromosomes are labeled
according to Ambros and Schweizer (1976).<p>

The C-band technique also allowed the detection of heterochromatin
polymorphism (amount, distribution) between samples and ecotypes
(cytotypes; AMBROS and SCHWEIZER).<p>

Because the linkage map of Koornneef et al. (1983) has been adopted by
molecular geneticists for their restriction fragment length
polymorphism (RFLP) map of the A. thaliana genome (Chang et al., 1987;
Hauge et al., 1987), we suggest that the cytological chromosome
designations should be altered correspondingly once the relationship
between the karyotype (Figure 1) and genetic linkage is established.<p>

The chromosome dimensions given in Figure 1 allow an estimate of the
physical size (DNA basepairs) of the five chromosomes of A. thaliana
(Figure 2). In Figure 2 a tentative assignment of chromosomes to
linkage is suggested based on available genetic and cytological data
(see below). In addition, the position of the centromers, of satellite
DNA, and of rDNA is shown. Knowledge about physical chromosome size
and chromosomal landmarks should prove useful in molecular and genetic
studies.<p>

Figure 2: The cytological karyogram of Figure 1 redrawn so that the
presumptive correlation with the linkage map of Koornneef et al.
(1983) is evident. Satellite DNA (C-bands) is indicated by thicker
lines; polymorphic telomeric regions are dotted. Numbers in italics
refer to linkage map; numbers in brackets are the cytological
chromosome designations. The physical chromosome size is based on a
1C-value of 70 000 kbp.<p>

C-band material can be equated with satellite DNS Schweizer and Loidl,
1987). The total amount of constitutive C-heterochromatin (12.5%)
correlates well with the proportion of very rapidly reannealing
sequences of whole-plant DNA (10-14%, Leutwiler et al., 1984, see also
Martinez-Zapater et al., 1986). It is not known whether A. thaliana
has satellite DNA subfamilies specific for the
centromere/paracentromere region of individual chromosomes as have
been found in other species (see Schweizer et al., 1987). Cloned
chromosome-specific satellite DNA sequences would be valuable in a
number of applications.<p>

Nucleolus organizing regions (NORs) can be equated with clusters of
ribosomal RNA cistrons and their spacers (rDNA). We have tentatively
identified chromosome 5 (Figure 1) as major nucleolus organizing
chromosome. Chromosome 5 carries a terminal C-band in its short arm
(chromosomal 'satellite'). The rDNA is likely to extend from this band
to a more proximal region. It has been reported that A. thaliana has
approximately 570 copies of a 9900bp rDNA repeat unit per haploid
genome (Pruitt and Meyerowitz, 1986). From this it follows that about
6-7% of the total haploid karyotype length is occupied by rDNA. This
is a considerable part of the short arm of chromosome 5 (5p). We
assume that much of the short arm of chromosome 5 (including NOR,
chromosomal satellite) and the centromeric C-band region does not show
up in the available linkage maps (Koornneef et al., 1983; Change et
al., 1987), see also Meyerowitz et al., this volume). The same is
probably also true for all other C-band positive chromosome regions
which are considered as genetically empty. The genetic map (Koornneef
et al., 1983) differs in several aspects from the cytological
chromosome map (Figures 1 and 2). However, these differences are
likely to disappear when corrections for C-band DNA and rDNA are made.<p>

Sears and Lee Chen (1970) concluded from their study of diplotene
chromosomes in primary trisomics that there occur two pairs of
nucleolar chromosomes in A. thaliana corresponding to the so-called C
(concave) and R (round) trisomic and to linkage groups 4 and 2
respectively (Koornneef and Van der Veen, 1983). The additional
chromosome of the C trisomic has been described by Sears and Lee Chen
as a large near metacentric one with a heterochromatic arm and it was
considered to present the major nucleolar chromosome. It is most
likely that this chromosome corresponds to our #5 (Figures 1 and 2).
By contrast the R trisomic chromosome is short and
submetacentric/acrocentric. Its short arm is entirely heteropycnotic
at meitotic prophase. Sears and Lee Chen considered this Chromosome as
second (minor) nucleolar chromosome. This R-trisome presumably
corresponds to our chromosome 4 (Figures 1 and 2). However, we had so
far no evidence for the occurrence of NOR activity (rDNA) at the short
arm of #4 (4p) nor is this arm entirely C-banded in our material.
Further studies including other lines and using in situ hybridization
of rDNA should help to clarify this point.<p>

From what has been said above it would appear that the long arm of
chromosome 5 and the proximal part of its short arm (Figure 1)
correspond to linkage group 4 (the 'subterminal' centromere has not
yet been mapped). The shortest chromosome 4 (Figure 1) would then
correspond to linkage group 2. Cytological data from F (fragilis)
trisomics and further circumstantial genetic evidence suggest that
chromosome 1 corresponds to linkage group 1. The medium-size
meta/submetacentric chromosomes 2 and 3 are likely to correspond to
linkage groups 5 and 3 (Figure 2).<p>

We have analyzed cytologically the offspring of another trisomic line
(AIS Accession No. 838). This sample is said to have derived from line
III of Robbelen and Kribben (see Lee Chen and Sears, 1967), which
would correspond to the short linkage group 2. To our surprise, the
cytological analysis of four trisomic #838 seedlings by C-banding
suggested that it is chromosome 5 which is present in trisomic
condition (Figure 3) rather than chromosome 4. Phenotypic examination
clearly reveals the C-type habitus (linkage group 4).<p>

We have no other explanation for this unexpected result than a
confusion of seed material. We are currently reexamining this trisomic
source cytologically and molecularly using rDNA in situ hybridization
(Figure 4) and by a detailed description of the trisomic plant
habitus. Also, other trisomic provenances will be studied wuch as the
telotrisomics selected by Koornneef (1983).<p>

labelling with Biotin-dUTP and an immunochemical detection procedure
(see Ambros and Schweizer, 1987). a) in situ hybridization pattern by
biotin-avidin/FITC b) nuclear counterstaining with DAPI<p>

Which approaches are then available and then promising for relating
cytological chromosome data with genetic in A. thaliana?<p>

We have already mentioned in situ hybridization. Molecular in situ
hybridization of defined DNA sequences to metaphase chromosomes would
at first sight appear of little help in A. thaliana. The chromosomes
are too small and chromosome morphology is usually distorted following
the denaturation/renaturation steps in this method so that chromosome
identification is impossible. However, the use of cytogenetically
defined trisomics may prove helpful in attributing sequences to
chromosome types and linkage groups. The number of chromosomes
containing the probe sequence can be easily spotted in mitotic
metaphase spreads and also in interphase nuclei. Preliminary tests
with rDNA demonstrated that this approach is feasible (Figure 4).
Repeated sequence probes in conjunction with nonisotopic methods will
be of particular use. Detection of low or single copy sequences is
more difficult but should be possible by autoradiographic techniques
(see Ambros and Schweizer, 1987).<p>

Southern hybridization techniques in conjunction with trisomics can be
chosen for gene assignment making use of the chromosome type specific
copy number excess in trisomics (1.5:1). Such rather subtle
differences in gene dosage can be detected providing a hybrid gene
probe that includes a reference gene sequence is employed (Ellis and
Cleary, 1987). The method requires the cytological examination of the
plants from which the DNA is extracted. Preferably, DNA from a single
trisomic individual is employed, or if necessary, from several
homogeneous trisomic plants, and from uniform diploid plants of the
same origin.<p>

Separation of very large (up to chromosome-sized) DNA molecules by
pulsed field electrophoresis (PFE) should provide another means to
study chromosome-linkage relationships. Again trisomic mapping making
use of gene dosage excess should be helpful. Unfortunately our own
experience with DNA from higher plants and similar efforts from other
laboratories (e.g., Davies et al., 1987) show that the resolution of
chromosome sized DNA molecules by PFE is very difficult with higher
plants. From Figure 2 it is evident that even the shortest chromosome
(#4) of A. thaliana has about 10 megabase pairs of DNA per chromatid.
Only the free chromosome arms of telotrisomics (Koornneef, 1983)
contain DNA molecules that might be easily separated by current PFE
techniques.<p>

Intrachromosomal sequence assignment is not possible in A. thaliana by
molecular-cytogenetic techniques such as in situ hybridization. The
analysis of the chromosomal location of any DNA sequence can, however,
be performed by molecular hybridization to Southern blots of NotI and
SalI digested Arabidopsis DNA separated by PFE. This approach will
rely on the availability of a chromosomal NotI/SalI restiction map
and/or on mapping of the fragments via genetically (e.g., RFLP-)
mapped lambda clones (see E.M. Meyerowitz et al., this volume).<p>
