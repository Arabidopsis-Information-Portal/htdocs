<p>Multiple Faculty Positions in Genomics and Cell Biology</p>
<p>The Genomics, Cell, and Developmental Biology Program at Indiana
    University invites applications for two tenure-track faculty positions in
    Genomics and in Cell Biology. These positions will be filled at the
    assistant or associate professor level. Candidates should have
    well-developed research programs that apply cutting-edge approaches to basic
    questions in eukaryotic biology. Individuals whose research
    complements/extends our existing strengths are particularly encouraged to
    apply. Areas of strength in our program include chromatin structure, the
    cell cycle, chromosome segregation, the cytoskeleton, developmental
    mechanisms, and signal transduction. Our faculty employ a wide range of
    organisms, including, but not limited to, Arabidopsis, Drosophila, mammalian
    cells, yeast, and protists. All eukaryotic models are welcomed.</p>
