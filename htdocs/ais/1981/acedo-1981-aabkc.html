INTRODUCTION<p>

Mutant A-154 of Arabidopsis overproduces some of the oxidases
especially tyrosinase and peroxidase wherease it is low in some of the
ammonia-assimilating enzymes (Acedo, 1981). The activities of other
enzymes were investigated in an effort to locate the metabolic block
in mutant A-154.<p>

The levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP'ase), ribulose biphosphate
carboxylase (RUBP'case), and acid phosphatase in the mutant and in the
wild type are compared.<p>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<p>

The plants were grown in Pro-Mix soil (Premier Brands Inc., New York,
N.YU. 10017) 3-inch deep petri plates. The plates were kept in a
growth chamber illuminated with approximately 1000 footcandles and the
temperature was maintained at 24*degrees*C. After growth for 20 days,
the plants were harvested, washed thoroughly and used for the enzyme
assays described below.<p>

Adenosine Triphosphatase: The enzyme was assayed according to Henry
and Richard (1978). The assay mixture consists of 1.9 ml medium (50
micro M Tris buffer, pH 8.0, 5 micro M MgCl 2, 10 micro M
dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.05 micro M phenazine methosulfate (PMS), and
100 micro M sucrose); 0.3 ml of 5 micro M ATP, and 0.5 ml enzyme
extract. The wavelength was read at 420 nm against a standard without
the enzyme extract.<p>

Ribulose Biphosphate Carboxylase: The assay procedure used for
RUBP'case is a light modification of the method of Randall et al.
(1977). The plants were homogenized in 0.1M Tricine, pH 8.0, 2mM DTT,
5mM MgCl2, and 1 percent Polyclar AT. The homogenate was centrifuged
at 30.000 g for 10 minutes and afterwards dialyzed for 2 hours in a
media similar in composition to the extraction medium but without the
Polyclar AT. The assay mixture contained 50 micro l of a mixture of
0.2M Tris, pH 8.1, 10mM, New England Nuclear), and 40 micro l enzyme
extract. The reaction mixture was pre-equilibrated at 25*degrees*C
before addition of 10 micro l of 1 mM RUBP. Aliquots of 50 micro l
were removed at 30, 60 and 120 seconds and put in a vial with 3
volumes of 3N HCl-methanol. The samples were dried and the residue was
redissolved in 50 micro l NaHCO 3, then 50 micro l of 3 N HCl-methanol
was added and the samples dried again. The residue was redissolved in
water and 4 ml of scintillation solution (1 part Triton X-100, 2 parts
toluene scintillation solution composed of 8.25 g PPO and 0.25 g M 2
POPOP per liter toluene) was added. Radioactivity was counted in a
Packard scintillation counter.<p>

The extraction medium for acid phosphatase consisted of 100 mM
Tris-acetate, pH 5.5, with 1.5 percent Polyclar AT. The reaction
mixture according to Rhoades and Stewart (1976), contained 10 micro M
Tris-acetate, pH 5.5 and 4 micro M p-nitrophenyl phosphate
pe-equilibrated at 30*degrees*C, then 0.5 ml of the enzyme extract was
added to a final volume of 2 ml. The reaction was stopped with 1 ml N
NaOH after 15 minutes and the absorbance read at 405 nm.<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

Table 1: The mean specific activity of the 3 enzymes in Arabidopsis<p>

ATP'ase is about 2x more in mutant A-154 than in the wild type (Table
1). Like tyrosinase and peroxidase (submitted for publication) ATP'ase
is also overproduced in the mutant. One important role of ATP'ase in
the cells is to maintain the mebrane in an energized state so as to
promote the operation of the active transport systems (Henry and
Richard, 1978), and as a terminal step in the production of ATP. The
abnormally high amount of ATP'ase could contribute to the anomaly in
membrane function in mutant A-154. The beneficial effect of low pH
(Acedo, 1980) and the increased uptake of some metabolites by the
mutant over the wild type (results to be published elsewhere) are
further evidences that the membrane system in this mutant is
defective.<p>

The activity of RUBP'case in the mutant is slightly lower than in the
wild type. This enzyme, being the most abundant protein in the cells,
is not expected to be totally absent in the mutant, otherwise there
would be no photosynthesis, however, it was of interest to know the
level of this enzyme in the mutant. The low activity of RUBP'case may
contribute to the comparatively slow growth of mutant A-154.<p>

Acid phosphatase activity is lower in the mutant than in the wild
type. This enzyme is involved in the mobilization of nutrient reserves
(Baker and Takeo, 1973) and in the transport of sugars and other
metabolites across the membranes (Flinn and Smith, 1967), and in the
differentiation of plastids (Mlodzianowski, 1971)<p>

Like the oxidases and the ammonia-assimilating enzymes studied
earlier, it is apparent that the activities of adenosine
triphosphatase, ribulose biphosphate carboxylase, and acid phosphatase
are under the control of a common regulatory gene and the main genetic
lesion is still the subject of continuing investigation.<p>

Thanks are due to Dr. G.P. Redei for his critical reading of this
paper, and to Dr Buyanovsky for permitting use of the scintillation in
his laboratory.<p>
