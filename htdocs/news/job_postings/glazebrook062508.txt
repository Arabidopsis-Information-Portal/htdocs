to the fungal nectrotroph Alternaria brassicicola.  Another part of the project involves 
investigation of the effects of cell wall alterations on resistance to various pathogens.  
The work provides opportunities to develop and enhance skills in genetics, molecular 
biology, and computational biology.  Interested scientists may also participate in 
programs to develop teaching skills.  The position is available beginning September 1, 
2008, and is funded for three years.   
The University of Minnesota provides excellent research and educational opportunities. 
The successful applicant will be based primarily in the Center for Microbial and Plant
