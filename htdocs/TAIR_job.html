<blockquote>

The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) is seeking two full-time
database curators to participate in the collection and display of data
for research use, the development and improvement of data model for
TAIR database, and the development of software tools for literature curation,
data integration, visualization, and analysis.  Data types to curate
and develop into the database structure include experimental
data from the Arabidopsis literature, genome sequencing and
annotation, functional genomics, genetic and physical maps and genetic
markers, microarrays, phenotype and mutant lines, and biochemical
pathways.

<P>

Successful candidates will have a Ph.D degree or equivalent in
biology, a demonstrated ability for independent, critical thinking and
excellent communication and teamwork skills.  Prior laboratory
experience with Arabidopsis is preferred.  Candidates with some
background in biochemistry are especially encouraged to apply. Also,
candidates with a working knowledge of PERL, SQL, and/or basic shell
scripting languages is desired but an extensive background in
computing is not required.  Familiarity with basic UNIX commands,
spreadsheets, and commonly used biological research tools such as
BLAST and MEDLINE searching would be assets.

<P>
For more information contact us by email at <a href="mailto:curator@arabidopsis.org"><B>curator@arabidopsis.org</B></a> OR bring a resume and come talk to us at our drop-in help corner at the upcoming <a href="http://www.wisc.edu/union/info/conf/arabidopsis/arabidopsis.html">Arabidopsis meeting</a> in Madison.
<P>
Qualified candidates should send a resume to:
