The peculiar Gf factor in linkage group 2 decreases the recombination
frequency in a chromosomal region of the female (REDEI, 1965).  It has
been observed furthermore that from 520 pollen grains tested, only 166
(31.9%) carried the gametophyte factor (Gf), while none of the
functional eggs transmitted Gf.  Tests on additional 1794 chromosomes
of the male gametophyte demonstrated a 34.9% (611) transmission of Gf,
while none of the additional 647 female second chromosomes were
abnormal, thus agreeing with previous observations.<p>

Table: Difference in recombination frequency in the two sporocytes in
the presence of factor Gf.  Constitution of the Gf carrier was Gf +
py/+ hy +<p>

In the present experiments recombination was studied in three regions
with Gf + py/+hy + plants.  Results summarized in the table
demonstrate that the crossing over reducing effect of Gf in the female
is polarized. The reduction is greater in the immediate vicinity of
the factor than in distal regions. The presence of Gf in the
microsoporocyte does not appear to have an influence on recombination.<p>

Recently obtained other lines of evidence seem to indicate that of the
three markers used, Gf is proximal to the centromere. Thus the sex
differential recombination in Arabidopsis is similar to that observed
by RHOADES in chromosome 5 of maize. That particular chromosome,
however, did not display the peculiar behavior of the Gf carrier,
i.e., the complete absence of female transmission. Both genes may be
situated in the heterochromatin, since Arabidopsis chromosomes are
also heterochromatic in the vicinity of the centromere.<p>
