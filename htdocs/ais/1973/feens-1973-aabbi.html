<h2> Negative results of treatment with bacterial DNA on "repair" of mutants of Arabidopsis</h2><p>

(Institute of Genetics, University of Groningen, Haren-Gn., The
Netherlands)<p>

LEDOUX, HUART and JACOBS (1971) have reported reversion of mutant to
wild phenotype as a consequence of treatment of seeds of Arabidopsis
with solutions of DNA from bacteria.  Since both bacterial
transformation and genetics of Arabidopsis are research topics in our
laboratory we were interested in repeating these experiments.<p>

After having carried out several experiments we now want to report
that we have not been able to obtain positive results. Since
"transformation" of higher plants with bacterial DNA is a novel and
potentially useful phenomenon, it seems worthwhile to inform other
workers possibly active in this field of the fact that we did not
succeed in obtaining it.<p>

In the following, the data of our last experiment are given. DNA was
isolated from Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis cultures
according to the modified Kirby procedure of VENEMA et al. (1965). The
B.subtilis DNA had normal biological activity when tested in bacterial
transformation.  It was divided into two portions, one of which
underwent an additional precipitation with ethanol, after which it was
redissolved in DSC (0.015 M NaCl + 0.0015 M trisodium citrate).<p>

The E.coli DNA and the two samples of B.subtilis DNA were dialized
against DSC for several days, until phenol free.  DNA concentrations
determined by the diphenylamine reaction (BURTON, 1956), were in *gamma*
per ml: E.coli about 900, B.subtilis about 650, B. stubilis,
precipitated and redissolved, about 600.<p>

Seeds of the thiamineless Arabidopsis mutant V131 (FEENSTRA, 1964),
requiring the pyrimidine moiety of thiamine for growth, were
sterilised using hydrogen-peroxide/ethanol, and dried.<p>

About 100 seeds were placed in a well of a spotplate and immersed in
0.04 ml of DNA solution.  Spotplates were placed in Petri dishes over
DSC, to prevent evaporation of the solvent. Each type of DNA solution
was used to incubate 10 times 100 seeds; the same amount of seeds was
treated with DSC, as a control.  Petri dishes were kept at
25*degrees*C and continuously illuminated for 48 hours. Both DNA and
DSC treated seeds germinated partly during the incubation period.
After incubation seedlings and not germinated seeds were laid out in
Petri dishes on perlite moistened with a mineral nutrient solution;
the dishes were then continuously illuminated at 25*degrees*C.<p>

Mutant seedlings on mineral medium die off within 10 to 15 days,
showing chlorophyll-less rosette leaves (FEENSTRA, 1964); "repaired"
plants are expected to grow, and to exhibit more or less normal green
colour.  None of the latter were found. The number of seedlings after
each treatment are given below.<p>
