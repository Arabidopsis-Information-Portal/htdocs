<h2> Preliminary report on callus formation and growth in vegetable-juice and WHITE's liquid media</h2><p>

University, East Lansing, Mich. U.S.A.)<p>

Wildtype root pieces were innoculated into liquid vegetable juice
medium and into modified WHITE medium.  Callus appeared after one
month and grew into balls around 1 mm in diameter after three months.<p>

The vegetable juice medium was HELLER's (WHITE, 1963), to which had
been added 2% dextrose and 10% "V8" juice.  V8 juice is a blend of
tomatoes, carrots, celery, beets, parsley, lettuce, watercress, and
spinach. The modified WHITE medium is the one used for growing tobacco
cells (FILNER, 1965).<p>

In other experiments, roots wre blenderized 15 seconds and used to
innoculate the following three media:<p>

A.  Heller minerals + 2% dextrose + 3% coconut milk<p>

B.  Heller minerals + 2% dextrose +6% V8 juice<p>

C.  Heller minerals + 2% dextrose<p>

Callus formation was obtained in both media A and B, but subsequent
growth of the callus is extremely slow.  See Table 1 for growth
results.<p>

are in mg of dry weight<p>

When whole plants, 2" tall, were used as innoculum in modified WHITE
medium, callus nodules appeared in a month.  However, when placed in
V8 juice medium, the plants usually grew into irregular green balls 11
to 15 mm in diameter with numerous roots, stems, and leaves.  Parts of
these balls, when transferred to fresh medium, grew into balls in
about two weeks.  Hence fresh material can be kept by transferring
into fresh medium every two weeks.<p>

Following the work of ZIEBUR (1965) who has subcultured tissue from a
piece of hypocotyl, we have transferred the callus culture obtained
from modified WHITE medium into agar culture containing 2, 4-D at the
concentration of 3 mg/liter and 20% coconut milk and into another agar
culture where the coconut milk was replaced by 10% corn liquid.  In
both media growth is very rapid and results are very promising.<p>
