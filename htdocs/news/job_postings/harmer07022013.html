<p>Post-doctoral Research Positions at UC Davis</p>
<p>Two post-doctoral positions in circadian biology are available in the
    Department of Plant Biology at UC Davis, starting October 1, 2013 or upon
    agreement.</p>
<p>The NIH-sponsored project focuses on understanding the molecular basis of
    circadian rhythms in the complex eukaryote Arabidopsis thaliana. Although
    the Arabidopsis circadian clock influences diverse stress, developmental,
    and growth pathways, its molecular nature is incompletely understood. In
    particular, how the clock regulates expression of nearly one-third of the
    transcriptome so that target genes are expressed at specific times of the
    day and night is largely unknown. Two post-doctoral fellows are sought for
    two related projects: investigating the roles of the RVE family
    transcription factors and of a novel chromatin regulatory protein within the
    circadian system.</p>
<p>We recently identified a small family of transcription factors (the RVEs)
    as essential components of the plant clock (Rawat et al, 2011; Hsu et al,
    2013). These Myb-like factors promote the expression of evening-phased
    target genes, acting in opposition to the repressors CCA1 and LHY to ensure
    the clock runs with a close to 24 hour rhythm. Among other experiments, the
    successful post-doc applicant will carry out competitive chromatin
    immunoprecipitation experiments to define the genome-wide binding dynamics
    of, and competitive interactions between, these antagonistic transcription
    factors. He/she will then correlate these chromatin binding dyamics with the
    circadian patterns of expression of target genes. These studies will allow
    us to define how the binding parameters of antagonistic transcription
    factors to promoters shape the dynamic control of gene expression in vivo.</p>
<p>The second project focuses on XCT, a gene originally identified as a
    circadian mutant (Martin-Tryon and Harmer, 2008). Although mutation of XCT
    affects multiple processes, the circadian clock is particularly sensitive to
    changes in XCT function. We have recently determined that XCT encodes a
    chromatin regulatory protein with conserved function across eukaryotes
    (Anver et al, submitted; Ellison et al, submitted). The successful post-doc
    applicant will use genomic, genetic, and biochemical approaches to study the
    mode of action of XCT and how it affects the clock.</p>
<p>Successful applicants will have received their PhD degrees within the
    past three years, have strong publication records, be familiar with standard
    molecular techniques, and have a keen interest in circadian biology;
    familiarity with genome-wide analytical methods would be highly
    advantageous. A strong record of publication will be the major criterion for
    screening applicants.</p>
<p>This work will be performed at the Dept. of Plant Biology at the
    University of California, Davis, under the supervision of Dr. Stacey Harmer.
    With over 100 plant-focused research groups and a strong program in the
    biological sciences in many model systems, UC Davis provides an excellent
    environment for fundamental studies in plant biology. Davis is a pleasant
    college town located in the northern Central Valley of California. It is 20
    minutes from the state capital (Sacramento), and 1hr 20Õ from San Francisco.
