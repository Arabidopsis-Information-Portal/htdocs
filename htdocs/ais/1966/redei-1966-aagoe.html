	It was demonstrated earlier that 6-azauracil or 6-azauridine modifies the expression of the variegation associated with the recessive gene im.  This pyrimidine analog increased several fold the chloroplastid pigment content of the mutant.  Similar observations were made with kinetin.  Inorganic phosphorus content of the mutant, especially that of the white tissue, was also two-three times higher than that of the wild type.  These findings indicated an anomaly of the RNA metabolism.  A crude nuclease enzyme extracted from the mutant digested more RNA per time units.  This increase of activity  was highly dependent on the pH of the incubation mixture.  From a purified yeast RNA, at pH 4.0 twice as much acid soluble products were made by the "mutant enzyme" than by that of the wild type.  At the pH optimum of the RNA digestion (7.1) the difference is slight.  This may be due to the fact that at neutral pH there is also a very high phosophdiesterase activity, while this latter enzyme did not hydrolyse appreciable amount of p-nitrophenyl-thymidine-5-phosphate below pH 5.  The RNA digestion at pH 7 is about 10-12 times as fast as at pH 4.  It is also conceivable that the mutation affects only one of the several components of the Arabidopsis nuclease.  The activity of the two enzymes was compared on protein content.  The amount of soluble protein per dry weight is only slightly lower in the mutant than that in the wild type.  Since the differentiation of the plastids was abnormal in the white sectors of the mutant a comparison of crude enzymes on protein basis might be misleading because of the different composition of the total protein.  Phospho-diesterase, 3'-nucleotidase, 5'-nucleotidase, phosphatase activity is not much different, however, in the mutant from that of the wild type. The crude enzyme of the wild type and the mutant hydrolyze the phophodiester bonds of all four nucleotides of RNA. The purine linkages, especially that of the guanosine phosphates, were split preferentially in both genotypes. From the three tested synthetic polynucleotides, however, polyuridylic acid was digested much easier than polycytidylic or polyadenylic acid.  The information available at this time does not allow any firm conclusion whether the mutant makes only more ribonuclease or this enzyme would be qualitatively different from that of the wild type.<p>
