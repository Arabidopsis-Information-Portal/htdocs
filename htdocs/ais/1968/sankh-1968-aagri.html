Zeatin - the only identified cytokinin from higher plants has recently
been claimed to exhibit much stronger cytokinin-like properties than
kinetin, 6-benzylaminopurine and certain other cytokinins (LETHAM,
1967).  In contrast, abscisin II - a naturally occurring
abscission-accellerating, dormancy-inducing, senescence-enhancing and
germination-inhibiting substance appears to possess properties that
are apparently opposite to those shown by cytokinins (OKHUMA et al.,
1963; CORNFORTH et al., 1966; SANKHLA and SANKHLA, 1968 a,b,c).
Earlier we observed that kinetin can effectively overcome the
senescence-accelerating effect of abscisin II (SANKHLA and SANKHLA,
1968b).  The present experiments were undertaken to evaluate the
comparative potentialities of two other cytokinins, viz., zeatin and
6-benzylaminopurine, in reversing the effect of abscisin II in leaf
senescence of Arabidopsis.<p>

Our observations indicated that mature rosette leaves of Arabidopsis
can be used as an excellent experimental material in studies relating
to senescence because in these leaves the disintegration of
chlorophyll in the dark is very quick and it is very easy to grow the
plants of desired age in the green-house.  Therefore, the present
experiments were performed with leaf discs punched from mature rosette
leaves (33 days old) of A. thaliana, En-2.  Lots of 20 leaf discs (8mm
in diameter) were placed on petri dishes containing filter paper
moistened with 5 ml of distilled water or an equivalent amount of the
solution of the growth substance to be tested. Then the petri dishes
were kept in the dark for 48 hrs.  During this period two observations
were made on chlorophyll content of the senescing leaf discs: one
after 24 hrs and the other after 48 hrs.  Chlorophyll was determined
by simply extracting the pigment of 15 leaf discs with 10 ml solution
of 80% acetone and measuring the optical density of this extract at
665 mn.<p>

It is clear from the Table that whereas abscisin II considerably
hastens leaf senescence both 6-benzylaminopurine and zeatin act as
strong senescence-delaying factors in leaf discs of Arabidopsis.  A
comparison of these results with our earlier results (SANKHLA, 1968b)
indicates that both these chemicals are far more superior to kinetin
in delaying the senescence of leaf discs of Arabidopsis.  Also, it was
noted with interest that both the cytokinins tested successfully
suppressed the senescence-accelerating action of abscisin II.  In this
respect, zeatin appeared to be superior to 6-benzylaminopurine.<p>

Experiments designed to explore the mechanism of kinetin action in
retarding cellular senescence in Xanthium have clearly shown that
senescence is directed through RNA synthesis that is DNA dependent
(OSBORNE, 1967).  It has also been observed that the decline in RNA
synthesis during senescence is not the result of loss of total DNA,
but rather reflects a failure of the DNA to provide an effective
template for RNA synthesis.  In some way, therefore, kinetin would
appear to maintain this template (OSBORNE, 1967).  On the other hand
abscisin II has been shown to reduce the incorporation of 14C-leucine
into protein (OSBORNE, 1967).  Our unpublished results indicate that
abscisin II-induced inhibition of lettuce seedling growth could be
greatly reversed by simultaneous addition of nucleic acid precursors.
These results would probably suggest that one action of abscisin II
might be exerted through nucleic acid metabolism.  Incidentally it
should also be mentioned that cytokinin - abscisin II antogism has
been observed also for the growth of calli obtaihed from the
cotyledons of Ipomea and for seed germination of Arabidopsis (SANKHLA
and SANKHLA, 1968c,d).  It might be quite possible that the
interaction between the endogenous cytokinins and abscisin II
functions in bringing about growth and senescence.<p>
