The study of chlorophyll mutants in higher plants is one of the
experimental ways to investigate the mutual relationships between the
structural organization and the functional activity of the
photosynthestic apparatus. Pigmental mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana
are widely used for genetical investigations, but their physiological
and biochemical characteritics are yet to be studied. At the same time
the study of these mutants including such forms having high biological
productivity may provide a valuable material for understanding the
physiological, biochemical basis of productivity. Since plants of
Arabidopsis thaliana produce little mass and small leaf surface it is
very promising for the study of their photosynthetic apparatus to use
highly sensitive biophysical methods, which provide information from
intact plants.<p>

During this work the highly productive mutant triplex, originated from
race Enkheim was investigated. The mutant has bigger rosettes and a
bigger leaf surface. The results investigated demonstrate, that the
cells and the size of chloroplasts of the mutant leaves is smaller
than in the plants of the race Enkheim, but the quantity of
chloroplasts is considerably larger (Table 1a). The chlorophyll
content of the mutant per unit of area and per chloroplast is higher
(30%) than that of race Enkheim, and the ratio of chlorophyll a to
chlorophyll b does not change practically. The mutant triplex has a
higher 14 CO 2 fixation level calculated for 1 mg chlorophyll per unit
of leaf surface, and for the whole plant (Table 1b). Methods of
registration of EPR 1- signals from the kation - radical of P 700, and
the intensitivity of delayed fluorescence with 3-(3, 4 dichlorophenyl)
- 1, 1 - dimethylurea (DCMU) show, that the mutant triplex has less
reaction centers of PS I and PS II per mg of chlorophyll, but its
quantity of antenna chlorophyll is larger than in race Enkheim.<p>

The small quantity of reaction centers per mg of chlorophyll has no
adverse result for the photosynthetic processes since mutant triplex
has a higher content of chlroophyll per unit leaf surface; th leaf
area of mutant is also bigger. Taking into account that the functional
activity of one mutant chloroplast is higher than in race Enkheim
(Table 1c) possibly, this high activity (noncyclic electron transport,
photophosphorylation, potential rate of Co2 fixation) is ensured by
high effectiveness of each electron transport chain.<p>

The analysis of light curves for delayed fluorescence of triplex
leaves show, that their turning point corresponding to saturation of
the photosynthesis occurs at a higher intensity of light (Figure 1a).
Enlargement of the antenna complex of the light requiring plant is an
unexpected fact. Possibly, such an organization of the photosynthetic
apparatus in mutant triplex enables frequent stimulation of the
reaction centers and fast electron flow through the photosynthetic
chain.<p>

During the induction phase intact leaves of the mutant have a higher
speed of delayed fluorescence fade-out (Figure 1b) which indirectly
confirms the higher level of CO2 fixation per unit area and coincides
with the results of direct measurements. The fade-out of delayed
fluorescence also indicates the higher rate of noncyclic electron
transport in intact leaves, as compared with the race Enkheim, which
coincides with the results of the direct measurements of isolated
chloroplasts (Table 1c)<p>

ATP is the second component of the reduction force for effective
CO2-fixation, which forms due to the phosphorylation reactions. The
results show that in mutant chloroplasts the rate of ATP-formation is
higher in the presence of noncyclic electron acceptor, as well as with
the cofactor PMS. The effectiveness of photosynthesis is possibly due
to the compact membrane structure of the triplex chloroplast, which
differs from the chloroplasts of race Enkheim because of developed
stroma lamellae. The compact membrane system allows maximum contact
between different parts of the membrane and with the matrix; all in
all this, possibly, results in high photosynthetic effectiveness,
which happens to be the foundation of viability and biological
productivity of the mutant.<p>
