Some characteristics of mutant im have been reported (REDEI 1964) and
some possible mechanisms of the variegation have been suggested.
Recent studies indicate that visible light is one of the most
important agents affecting the phenotype of im.  It appears that the
photosensitive substance has an absorption maximum in the red region
of the spectrum.  In continuous illumination under a blue filter the
leaf pigment content raises several fold above to that of the control
(continuous spectrum) while under a red filter pigment production is
suppressed considerably.<p>

Cysteine provides some protection against red light and increases the
beneficial effect of blue light.  At low temperatures, short daily
illumination (8 hs) promotes plastid differentiation considerably. At
higher temperatures this beneficial effect is manifested only if the 8
hs illumination is not continuous but it is interrupted in several
cycles. The 8 x 1 hr daily illumination is also very efficient in
promoting flowering and in reducing hypocotyl elongation in contrast
to the 1 x 8 hr light treatment.  Since the photoperiodic response or
stem elongation is not affected by the im mutation it appears that a
receptor system different from the phytochrome is involved.  It is not
yet known what steps of gene function are affected by the various
inducers and inhibitors.  Experiments are underway to test the most
effective spectral regions, and to investigate the site of the
photosensitive system by using selective inhibitors and
antimetabolites.<p>
