[Arabidopsis] Postdoctoral position at Cornell


A postdoctoral fellow is sought to join a leaf senescence research laboratory at Cornell University. 
Leaf senescence is a unique developmental process that is achieved by operation of massive programmed 
cell death and nutrient recycling. The senescence process limits crop yield and biomass accumulation. 
It also contributes to much of posthavest loss of many horticultural crops. Our goal is to unravel the 
regulatory mechanism of leaf senescence, and based on our molecular findings, to devise ways to 
genetically manipulate the process for agricultural improvement and better bioenergy production.  The 
successful candidate will use various biochemical, cell biological, molecular, genetic and genomic tools 
to dissect the regulatory mechanisms underlying leaf senescence in both model systems (such as Arabidopsis 
and tobacco) and crops (such as wheat, soybean).

Applicants should have received their PhD degree in biochemistry, genetics, bacteriology, plant molecular 
biology, molecular plant physiology or a closely related field within last two years.  The applicants should 
be highly motivated and career-oriented.  Working experience in molecular biology is a must, and experience 
with Arabidopsis, tobacco, maize and/or soybean is a plus. The position needs to be filled immediately so 
preference will be given to those who will be able to start their appointment at Cornell very soon.

To apply, please email your application with current CV, and names, phone numbers and email addresses of at 
least three references to Dr. Su-Sheng Gan at SG288@CORNELL.EDU.
