With the aim of selection alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) mutants in cell
cultures, we have firstly examined the characteristics of the ADH
system in Arabidopsis.<p>

In plants ADH activity is confined to pollen and seeds, rapidly
declines during germination and is no more measurable in leaves or
roots. Seed-derived callus induced on a PG2 culture medium (Negrutiu
et al., 1975) containing 1 mg/l 2,4-D are characterized by a high
level of ADH activity (five to ten times more specific activity than
in seeds), which allows the electrophoretical analysis of tissue
issued from a single seed.<p>

Three types of electrophoretic variants have been identified among 65
tested geographical races by using starch gel electrophoresis with
Tris-citrate 0.15 M pH 7.0 as running buffer. These types have been
designated as A, F, and S following the order of electrophoretical
mobility with respect to the anode (Figure 1b). The distribution of
the types among races is respectively 47.7% of A, 46.1% of F and 6.2%
of S type. Electrophoretograms of callus extracts show only one
densely stained band. Similar ADH pattern has been obtained by using
native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to FERL et al.
(1979).<p>

Figure 1a: Dissociation-reassociation of a mixture of F+A extracts.
The samples were mixed 1:1 with respect to activity, frozen for 16
hours at -20*degrees*C in the absence or presence of NaCl lM.<p>

Dissociation of the enzyme into monomers was accomplished according to
Fisher and Schwartz (1973). Reassociation occurred once the extract
was thawed and kept at room temperature. A mixture of F and A extracts
yields the original isozymes plus a newly formed hybrid band (Figure
1a). Hybrid patterns and segregation data after crosses between S and
F types confirm as shown by the in vitro dissociation-reassociation
results that the enzyme behaves as a dimer and is controlled by a
single genetic locus with three co-dominant alleles S, F and A.<p>

In order to get such ADH activity mutants a selection procedure was
applied using M2 seeds obtained from M1 seeds mutagenised with ethyl
methane sulfonate. After 48 hours of incubation on mineral medium,
pregerminated seeds are exposed to varying concentrations of allyl
alcohol vapor. An exposure of 10 minutes to concentrations from 10 to
45 microM was found to be very effective. The seedings were further
grown and scored for development. Most plants turned white; the green,
surviving plants are then transplanted and their resistance confirmed
in the next generations. From 16.000 M2 seeds, 4 progenies were still
resistant to allyl alcohol in M3 and M4 generations. Seed-derived
callus were tested for ADH activity. One of them behaved as a ADH null
type. The genetic analysis is now in progress.<p>

Besides the value of ADH null and electrophoretical mutants for
somatic cell genetics, we intend to use their properties to increase
the amount of haploid cells in anther-derived cell clusters obtained
from heterozygote Adh1+/Adh1(null) plants by using the selection power for
resistance against allyl alcohol.<p>
