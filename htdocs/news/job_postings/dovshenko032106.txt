International Graduate School
Signal Systems in Plant Model Organisms

The International Graduate School offers research
opportunities in cellular, molecular, developmental,
physiological, evolutionary genetics and genomics,
mathematical modelling and systems biology in plant
model organisms (Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa,
Populus, Physcomitrella patens and Cyanobacteria).
Students carry out a Ph.D. research project in one of
the participating groups. The training program offers a
wide ranging training agenda and specialized support to
current colleagues in the network. The fellowship,
according to the rules of the German Research
Foundation (DFG), is granted for three years after an
initial trial period of six months. Additional funds are
available for attendance at scientific meetings and
training courses, and for invitation of speakers at an
international level to Freiburg.
Applicants should hold a degree comparable to a
German University Diploma in Biology, Biochemistry,
Physics or Mathematics. For further information on the
programme, deadlines and the application form,
