Postdoctoral/Technician Position: Arabidopsis circadian clock 

A post-doctoral and/or research technician position is available to 
investigate the plant circadian clock in the Division of Integrative 
Biosciences and Biotechnology at Pohang University of Science and Technology 
(POSTECH) in Pohang, South Korea. 
http://ibb.mpstation.net/m2/index3.html We have a new laboratory 
here with research opportunities to study 
post-translational processes controlling the circadian system in Arabidopsis 
(Wang et al., 2010 EMBO J. 29:1903-15; Fujiwara et al., 2008 J.Biol.Chem. 
283: 23073-23083; Kim et al., 2007 Nature 449: 356-360). The lab is housed 
in a building sharing growth facilities and other resources with excellent, 
well-established plant molecular groups at POSTECH, along with newly 
established labs in membrane biophysics and chemical biology of 
protein-protein and lipid-protein interactions. This is an excellent 
opportunity for Koreans interested in returning to South Korea, but there is 
also a strong international research community here. Expertise in 
biochemistry and molecular biology is highly desirable. Previous experience 
with Arabidopsis research is not a requirement, but very useful. Ability to 
work independently and coordinately will be an important asset. All 
scientific exchange is in English, and highly motivated individuals with 
excellent English communication skills are strongly encouraged to apply. 

These positions are available immediately. Starting yearly salary for 
post-docs will be 25,000,000 KRW to 35,000,000KRW depending on experience; 
20,000,000 to 25,000,000 KRW for technicians. Interested applicants 
should send inquires and their CV, a statement of research interests and 
career goals, to: Dr. David E. Somers Department of Molecular Genetics
