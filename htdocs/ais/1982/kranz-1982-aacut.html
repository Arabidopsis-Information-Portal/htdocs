INTRODUCTION<p>

In continuation of our previous studies (Kranz, 1981, a b) additional
results have been obtained on the role of certain inhibitor substances
involved in the enzymatic regulation of certain metabolic steps of
thymidine metabolism during the floral induction process.<p>

Evidently, there is significant similarity between the first induction
of flowering promoted rsp. inhibited by interfering light of certain
quality lunder noninductive photoperiods and the strong promotion rsp.
inhibition of flowering affected by thymidilate synthetase rsp.
orotidine phosphate decarboxylase inactivation (reactions shown in Figure
1). The competence for the responses is restricted to the first week
after sowing.<p>

This pattern has been experimentally controlled by adding the
inhibitors, 5-BrdU or 6-azauracile (AzaU) at specific molecular ratios
to the aseptic cultures which resulted in remarkable shortening or
prolongation of the vegetative stage. From such experimental data
conclusion was made that photoregulation of the thymidine kinases
transforms the DNA-synthesis from high rates at the periphery to low
rates in the center of the apical meristem by which flower induction
is performed.<p>

This working hypothesis has been verified by experiments now presented
here in which the inhibiting substance AMP of phosphoribosyl
pyrophosphate amindotransferase (PPATase) and/or the end product dTTP
of the pathway, which is controlled by the thymidine kinases (TKase
reactions 1 to 4 in Figure 1), were added under controlled conditions
of the medium and the light.<p>

MATERIAL AND METHODS<p>

Aseptic culture from surface sterilized seeds to flowering plants were
as follows: Redei's synthetic agarmedium plus caseinhydrolysate (lg/l)
and IAA (10E-6M); thymidine concentration as mentioned below, 5-BrdU
(DNA-nucleoside analogue of thymidine SIGMA) at low, nonmutagenic
doses (10E-4 to 10E-5M), AMP 4x10E-3 to 10E-4M) and/or dTTP (4x10E-3
to 10E-4M) fed through the medium or by dropping on the shoot apex.<p>

A. thaliana L.(Heynh.) seeds of Pr-O (wild type) and ch 2/ ch 2
(mutant line) were obtained from AIS-seed bank.<p>

Climate data of growth chamber used in experiments were for
temperature 20+/- 1*degree*C, rel. humidity 60 +/- 5%, photoperiod
9L/15D hrs. (non-inductive short day), and interfering light 15 min.
after 4 hrs. dark (D). Spectral quanta distibution were as reported
previously (see Table 1 in Kranz, 1981 b).<p>

of frequency values, 2-way-anova, linear correlation, t-test of
differences in means programmed in BASIC and calculated with Sharp PC
1211 CE 122 microcomputer system; significance level for error
probability at *alpha* &lt;/=.05 resp. .01 (further details in Kranz,
1981b).<p>

RESULTS<p>

With respect to the interaction of the effects of interfering light
and the thymidilate synthetase inhibition by BrdU additional results
have been obtained as follows:<p>

The enhancement of flowering in ch 2/ch 2 is significantly different
under variant conditions of interfering light (UV-C, UV-A, B, R, and
FR) as well as inhibitor substances (BrdU. BrdU + Thymidine, H 20
control). The time at which interfering light treatment begins (1st,
3rd, or 7th day after sowing) is effective in both genotypes studies
(Pr-0 and ch 2/ch 2) with high significance (see results of anova in
Table 1). Competence for the promoting effect of the interfering light
is maximum at the beginning (ch 2/ ch 2) or at the end of the first
week of seedling's development, i.e. the cotyledon's stage. In the
presence of BrdU far red (FR) or blue (B) are the most promotive
interfering lights in ch 2/ch 2 (Figure 1). Under those experimental
conditions the number of rosette leaves formed vegetatively and the
number of days until first flower opens are positively correlated at
high significance levels (probability levels 2*alpha*<0.01).<p>

The following new results have been obtained by using a further
inhibiting substance and a key substrate of the thymidine utilization
pathway of DNA.<p>

The inhibitors of PPATase activity (5-AMP) and of thymidine kinase 4
(dTTP) promote in the presence of BrdU shooting and flowering
significantly (see anova Table 2). In the absence of BrdU there is
only an enhancement of flowering when the substances are used
together; maximum effect is obtained at 10E-4M concentration, higher
concentrations (>10E-3M) are ineffective. Competence for flower
induction is highest for the first three days of seedling's
development. Correlation between number of vegetative leaves and time
until first flowering is also positive and significant (2*alpha*<0.05)
under such experimental conditions.<p>

CONCLUSION<p>

From the data presented, now, it is clear that among the interfering
light qualities FR and B, and among the inhibitor substances, BrdU,
are the stongest promoters of flowering in Arabidopsis. The
interaction between light and substance is mainly additive. Since
increase of flowering starts earlier and is steeper with FR or B than
with R or UV (Kranz, 1979, 1981 a and b) we may conclude that the
effect is primarily an inductive and secondarily a modifying one. With
BrdU, however, mainly an inductive influence on the flowering process
is supposed because flower induction is always earlier in relation to
control; thus BrdU may completely compensate for FR.<p>

Although enhancement of flowering, rsp. of axial cell activity
accompanying the transition to the reproductive phase, did not occur
following GA 3 application to the vegetative meristem of two other
ecotypes of Arabidopsis (Besnard-Wibaut, 1981), a similar interaction
was reported by GOTO (1981) for BrdU and GA 3 (8 hrs. light
photoperiod, line Est), where the plant hormone promoted flowering
earlier with flatter increase than the inhibitor substance; i.e.,
interaction was additive there, too, with respect to the inductive
process of flowering.<p>

For the new data on the influence of further inhibitors of thymidine
pathway our conclusion is the following: Additional treatment of 5-AMP
or dTTP (10E-4M) under BrdU-plus FR-conditions yields earlier and
steeper increase of flowering than in H20-control, which shows that
extra inhibition of PPATase activity through 5-AMP or of thymidine
kinase 4 through dTTP (Figure 1) resuls in further enhancement of
flowring. This influence, however, is mainly a modifying one, since in
the absence of BrdU promotion was only steeper with these substances
when they were applied together at higher concentrations of >10E-3M.
All in all the result confirms additionally our working hypothesis
mentioned above.<p>

SUMMARY<p>

Like interfering light FR and the inhibitor of thymidilate synthetase
BrdU studied earlier it is evident that inhibition of the PPATase and
thymidine kinase activity by 5-AMP rsp. dTTP results in additional
enancement of the flowering process. Thus, flowering of Arabidopsis
seems to be under photochemical control of the thymidine utilization
pathway as postulated previously.<p>
