Experiments are in progress to determine the effect of room
temperature storage of gamma-irradiated dormant seeds on survival,
growth, development, fertility, and mutation rate in Arabidopsis
thaliana (L.) HEYNH. race Enkheim.  A summary of preliminary results
of the root growth studies is presented below.  The seedlings for root
growth measurements were grown either in Petri dishes
("Keimwurzeltest" by MULLER, 1964), or in usual test tube culture by
LANGRIDGE (1957).<p>

In the first series of experiments (see Table 1) a single dose of
irradiation was used, while the storage time was varied.  A marked
(storage time dependent) increase in irradiation induced root growth
inhibition was observed.<p>

Table 1: Root length at the 7th day of growth (60 Co gamma, 70 kR,
dose rate about 180 kR/hr, test tube culture)<p>

In the second series of experiments (see Table 2) the effect of two
weeks storage was studied at a number of irradiation levels.<p>

Table 2: Root length at the 7th day of growth (60 Co gamma, dose rate
about 180 kR/hr, 2 weeks storage<p>

Here again, a heavier radiation injury was observed in seeds subjected
to storage.  More detailed description and discussion of the obtained
data will be published elsewhere.<p>
