INTRODUCTION<p>

Several reports have demonstated that the organogenetic capacity was
different between lines or varieties of plants (Bekhi and Lesley,
1976; Goto, 1979; see Okhi et al., 1978). Behki and Lesley (1976) have
studied the combination of growth substances for the regeneration of
plantlets from leaf explants of various mutants of tomato plants. I
have previously reported that the organogenetic capacity of dwarf
mutants of Arabidopsis plants was lower than that of the normal line
(Goto, 1979). It is interesting to clarify the different organogenetic
capacity in relation to the trait of mutants. Establishment of
techniques for plant regeneration may contribute to genetic research
and be useful to obtain a large number of hybrid plants.<p>

The object of this experiment is to try to reveal the organogenetic
capacity and its heritability in Arabidopsis thaliana.<p>

MATERIAL AND METHODS<p>

The normal line (Estland) and three mutant lines (F, le, Ap) of
Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. were used in this experiment. The
lines F and le are dwarf, and the line Ap is apetalous. All of these
lines are controlled by a single recessive gene. The hybrids were bred
with crossings between normal line as a male parent and each mutant
line as a female parent.<p>

The seeds were sterilized with calcium hypochlorite (5%) for 10 min. A
seed was planted on a 10 ml Redei's basal medium (Redei, 1965)
solidified with 1% agar in a test tube (25 mm diameter x 20 cm
height). The plants were grown in a growth chamber at 25*degrees*C
with a photoperiod of 16 hours light (about 5000 lux, cool white
fluorescent lamps) and 8 hours dark for about one month. When bolting
occurred, rosette leaves were cut with a surgical knife into about 5 x
8 discs. Stem segments were cut into one cm length from shoots grown
to about 15 cm height. Leaf derived calluses were grown on the B5
medium (Gamborg et al., 1968) supplemented with one mg/1 2,
4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4-D) for two passages. Five explants
or calluses (350 mg fresh weight) were placed on each medium in a 100
ml Erlenmeyer flask. They were incubated at 25*degrees* with the same
photoperiod as mentioned above.<p>

The nutrient medium or organogenesis was that of B5, solidified with
0.7% agar and supplemented with *alpha*-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA)
or indolyl-3-acetic acid (IAA) and 6-benzyladenine (BA). The pH of the
medium was adjusted to 5.5 with 0.2 N KOH. Fifty milliliter aliquotes
of the medium were poured into flasks and autoclaved at 120*degrees*C
for 15 min.<p>

The explants forming shoots, roots and/or calluses were scored with
the naked eye at 5-6 weeks and presented with relative frequency. For
each combination of the growth substances, 10-15 explants or calluses
were tested in each two separate experiments.<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

1. Effect of tissue age on the organogenesis<p>

The organogenetic capacity was compared between young stem-attached
and old rosette leaves, and between young stem just below the flower
part and old stem just above the rosette leaves. The result is shown
in Table 1. The shoots were formed in both the young and the old
leaves with all the combinations of NAA and BA, and both the shoots
and the roots were produced with the concentration of NAA and BA at 1
and 0.3 mg/l, respectively, regardless of the age of the leaves. In
the stems, the shoots were formed in most segments of both the young
and the old tissues, although no root was formed in any combination of
NAA and BA. Some investigations have indicated that the organogenetic
capacity of the explants was significantly different among plant parts
and according to ages of the organs (Hildebrandt, 1970; OKHI et al.,
1978). Present experiment with Arabidopsis plant did not show largely
different organogenetic capacity between tissue ages, although the
root-forming capacity was higher in the leaf discs than in the stem
segments. The shoots were formed in the media with relatively wide
ranges of the growth substances, while roots were formed at narrower
concentration ranges. The shoot-forming capacity seemed to be higher
than root-forming capacity in both the leaves and the stems at least
within the combinations of the growth substances used here. Similar
results have been obtained by Gamborg et al. (1974), who observed low
frequency of the root formation in spite of forming shoots at high
frequency in pea plants. However, Henke et al., (1978) indicated that
the root-organogenesis occurred at a higher frequency than the
shoot-organogenesis in rice plant.<p>

leaf discs.<p>

2. Comparison of NAA and IAA on the organogenesis<p>

The effect on the organ-formation was compared between NAA and IAA
(Table 2). The most marked root-formation was found in the combination
of NAA 1 mg/1 with BA 0.3 mg/l. Both the roots and shoots were formed
in the NAA containing media, in which hair- and callus-formations were
also initiated. Roots were not or seldom observed in the combinations
of IAA and BA in present concentration ranges, although shoots and/or
calluses were formed at similar frequency to that of the NAA groups in
all the combinations. Corcos et al., (1973) have succeeded to produce
normal plantlets from calluses of Arabidopsis plants in the
combination with IAA and Kinetin. Present experiment, however, could
not demonstrate the plantlet differentiation with the media containing
IAA. This failure may be due to the effect of the combined cytokinin
source. Here, since the calluses formed in IAA containing medium were
browinsh while those formed in NAA containing medium were greenish,
the action to the dedifferentiation was different between IAA and NAA.
Similar fact has been observed by Kartha et al. (1974) in rape plant.<p>

3. Organogenetic capacity of leaf discs and stem segments of normal
line, mutant lines, and their hybrids.<p>

Table 3 shows the organogenetic responses of the leaf discs of normal
line (Estland), three mutant lines and their hybrids. All of the
mutant lines showed lower organogenesis than the normal line. The
normal line formed a number of shoots on a leaf disc, but mutant F
formed less shoots and mutant le and Ap did not form shoots. The
root-forming capacity was not largely different between the lines, but
the higher concentration of BA the lower the root-formation in the
mutant F and le was. All the hybrids showed marked organogenetic
capacity in the formation of both the shoots and the roots. This
result indicates that the low organogenetic capacity of the mutant
lines is controlled by the recessive gene as well as the apetalous and
dwarf habits. In some cases, the organ-forming capacity of the hybrids
was greater than that of the normal line. The callus growth was also
more vigorous in the hybrids than in the normal line (hybrid vigor).<p>

NAA and BA.<p>

Plantlets differentiated from the leaf discs of the hybrids were
transferred to vermiculite in a pot after 6 weeks of culture. Some of
them grew vigorously, flowered and set fruits normally.<p>

In the stem segments, the shoot-forming capacity of the mutant lines
was also lower than that of the normal line (Table 4). However, the
hybrids showed high shoot-forming capacity and produced shoots of
similar frequency to the normal line. The callus growths of the
hybrids were superior to those of the normal and mutant lines,
indicating hybrid vigor.<p>

Table 5 shows the organogenetic responses of the calluses. Shoots were
scarcely formed in all the lines. However, roots were formed
relatively markedly in both the normal line and the hybrid.<p>

SUMMARY<p>

An experiment was performed to reveal the organogenetic capacity of
some mutant lines of Arabidopsis thaliana and their hybrids. There was
no distinct difference in organogenetic capacity between tissues of
different age. Leaf discs showed both the root- and shoot-forming
capacity in normal line and hybrids. Stem segments showed high
shoot-forming capacity and reduced root-forming capacity in all lines
and hybrids. Calluses showed rootforming capacity but scarcely formed
shoots. All the mutant lines have lower organogenetic capacity than
normal line, but their hybrids recovered the capacity to the level of
the normal parent line, and in some cases they showed the hybrid
vigor. Plantlets regenerated from explants of the hybrids grew
vigorously, flowered and set fruits in a pot.<p>
