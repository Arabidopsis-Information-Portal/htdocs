Earlier experiments on the extent of outcrossing in natural
populations of A. thaliana (cf. KARBE and ROBBELEN, 1968; BLISS and
ROBBELEN, 1969) did not yield conclusive estimates.  Therefore, in
1969 another test was scheduled. This experiment, as it appears only
now, was very similar to the investigation described above by LAWRENCE
and SNAPE, in that not racial characteristics but a monogenic marker
was used for detection of the hybrids.<p>

From the wild type "En" and a hairless mutant thereof with yellow
seeds, designated as F1, each 30 mg of seeds were mixed and sown in an
outdoor under glass hotbed. Thus on an area of about 6 m2 1450
En-plants and 1750 F1 mutants were grown in a dense mixed stand. Both
genotypes showed no major differences in vigour, flowering time,
pollen vitality and seed fertility.  Only seeds from the glabrous
mutant were harvested.  These were bulked and again chequed for wild
type admixtures by eliminating even the few erroneously included brown
seeds. Two subsequent sowings were performed from this seed bulk
giving<p>

From the latter group 210 hairy plants could be harvested and progeny
tested. The result was that according to the expectation 199 progenies
segregated 3:1 (with a total of 12,603 wild type: 3,168 hairless
phenotypes (= 25.2%), while by nonsegregation the rest, 11 proved to
be wild type admixtures.<p>

From these data the calculation of the outcrossing percentage in the
original mixed population runs as follows:<p>

199 hairy phenotypes in the "F1" generation demonstrated to be
hybrids; +18 hairy phenotypes not progeny tested, therefore possibly
including 11/210 ~ 5% wild type admixtures = 17 not tested hybrids,
giving a total of 216 hybrids within the grown "F1" of 20,448 + 216 =
20,664 plants.<p>

The outcrossing percentage thus amounts to 1.05%, a value very close
to that found in the preceding paper by LAWRENCE and SNAPE (1971).  On
the basis of other sporadic observations we also agree with these
authors that in Arabidopsis the outcrossing percentage may well vary
considerably with the actual environment.<p>
