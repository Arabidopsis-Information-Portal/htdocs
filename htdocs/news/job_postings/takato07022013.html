<p>Postdoctoral research positions at the University of Washington</p>
<p>Postdoctoral research positions (up to two) are immediately available to
    study the mechanisms underlying photoperiodic flowering in the Department of
    Biology at the University of Washington in Seattle, WA.</p>
<p>We recently demonstrated that a very unique F-box protein called FKF1
    likely functions as a photoperiodic light-sensor in Arabidopsis. Our
    immediate goal for our NIH-funded program will be to further elucidate the
    molecular mechanisms of FKF1-related seasonal measurement for flowering.</p>
<p>
    Recent publications and further information can be found on our website ( <a
        href="http://faculty.washington.edu/takato/)">http://faculty.washington.edu/takato/)</a>.
</p>
<p>Successful candidates will use biochemical and genomic approaches to
    study the mechanisms of photoperiodic flowering in Arabidopsis. A strong
    background in biochemistry and/or next gen. sequencing approaches, and/or
    computational biology will be highly advantageous. Applicants who have
    received their PhD degrees within the past three years preferred. Previous
    experience working in related fields is not necessary. Salary will be mainly
    based on the NIH pay scale. The positions will be initially available for
    one year, with renewal (up to four years) based on performance.</p>
<p>Seattle is a culturally vibrant city surrounded by beautiful mountain
    ranges and bodies of water (and there is very good coffee everywhere). The
    University of Washington is known to be very strong in life sciences, and
    the Department of Biology has many talented principal investigators, who
    work using Arabidopsis as well as other systems.</p>
<p>
    Applications should include a cover letter (1-2 pages) outlining past
    research and research interests, a CV and three letters of reference, and be
    sent to Dr. Takato Imaizumi (<a href='mailto:takato@uw.edu'>takato@uw.edu</a>).
