	Presoaked seeds of Arabidopsis were treated for 1 h at 36*degrees*C with aqueous solutions (pH 5) of N-nitroso-imidazolidon (NI).  Posttreatment soaking:  2 h at 36*degrees*C in water.  Root length reduction (r), degree of sterility (s) and frequency of recessive lethals were determined.<p>

NI is unstable in aqueous solution (half-life time at pH 5:  4 h, at pH 8:  15 min).  The hydrolysate was obtained by keeping 20 mM NI for 1 h at 90*degrees*C.<p>

NI is known to be mutagenic also in Saccharomyces (MARQUARDT et al., 1964) and to induce chromosomal aberrations in Vicia faba (RIEGER, personal communication).<p>
