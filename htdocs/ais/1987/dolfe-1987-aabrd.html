Arabidopsis alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH, E.C.l.l.l) is encoded by one
single gene, from which three different naturally occurring alleles
are known, called S, F, and A (Jacobs and Schwartz, 1980; Dolferus and
Jacobs, 1984). The enzyme has been purified and a crude antiserum has
been prepared against it. ADH exists as a dimer with a molecular
weight of 87.000 daltons. Zymograms from heterozygotes between the
different electrophoretic types show a typical three bands pattern,
due to hetrodimerization between different subunits (Dolferus and
Jacobs, 1984).<p>

ADH is supposed to play an important role in the survival of the
plant, submitted to anaerobic stress. In maize, ADH was shown to be
inducible under anaerobic conditions, together with a restricted set
of other "anaerobic proteins" (Sachs et al., 1980).<p>

In Arabidopsis we demonstrated that ADH activity is markedly increased
during callus induction. At the plant level, activity rapidly declines
during the germination process and is no more represented in mature
plants, except for some specific cell types around the vascular
bundles and in pollen grains (Dolferus et al., 1985). During anaerobic
circumstances it was also shown that Arabidopsis ADH is one of the few
proteins which are actively synthesized.<p>

The high degree of homology which was observed between the maize and
the Arabidopsis ADH system, indicates that ADH is a highly conserved
plant protein. This was also confirmed at the nucleotide level, by
using callus cultures induced from seeds of the race Bensheim (Be-O;
Adh A1 type). Using cloned maixe ADH 1 cDNA (Gerlach et al., 1982) as
a probe, we could find fairly strong hybridization signals at genomic
DNA level and at mRNA level. This observation was exploited to clone
the Arabidopsis ADH gene sequence. The Arabidopsis ADH gene (about
1800 bp long) was entirely sequenced and it was shown to contain 6
short introns, as already mentioned by Chang and Meyerowitz (1986) for
the race Landsberg erecta. The structure of the promoter region is
currently under investigation.<p>

Several ADH mutants were isolated using ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS)
as a mutagen on M 1 seeds, and allylalcohol selection on M 2
germinating seeds. Mutants lacking any enzyme activity survive
allylalcohol selection because they fail to convert the selecting
agent in the very toxic reaction product acroleine (Schwartz and
Osterman, 1976). The frequency at which mutants were obtained was 9 x
10E-5; 11 ADH null mutants were obtained for the race Bensheim Be-O
and 21 for the race Ts-1. Mutants R001 to R011 (Be-O background) were
further characterized at the genetical and biochemical level (Table
1). Electrophoresis of crosses between the different null mutants and
wild type race Ts-1 (Adh S1 type), showed that for some of them a
hybrid active band could be found beside the S band. This observation
led to the assumption that some of the mutants should contain an
inactive polypeptide which is still capable of forming active
heterodimers with the wildtype enzyme in heterozygotes.<p>

The mutants were subdivided into three classes on basis of the
formation of cross reacting material (CRM) using anti-Adh antibodies.
By rocket immunoelectrophoresis and western blotting techniques, we
found that some of the mutants did not produce any ADH like
polypeptides at all (CRM), some of them produced inactive ADH enzyme
at the normal level of expression (CRM+), and the third class
producing ADH CRM at a reduced level.<p>

Adh A1 background.<p>

The use of cloned ADH gene as a probe allowed to do the same
observation at mRNA level using Northern blot hybridization. Some of
the mutants clearly did not contain any ADH messengers, some others
had a normal level of mRNA and a few of them were characterized by a
reduced quantity of ADH mRNA.<p>

These mutants are presently analyzed at the DNA level in order to
localize the mutation. Using Southern blot hybridization of genomic
DNA digested with different restriction enzymes, no differences were
found up to now in the restriction pattern of mutant R001 to R011.
Most probably the mutations obtained until now are due to base
substitutions and not to deletions or rearrangements of the coding
sequence of the gene. One mutant type of each class will be
characterized at the sequence level of gene, in the hope to detect
interesting cases, like amber mutants or mutants in which the promoter
region is affected.<p>
