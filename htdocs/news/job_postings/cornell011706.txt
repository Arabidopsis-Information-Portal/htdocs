Plant Biology Internships at Cornell University

The Plant Genome Research Program (PGRP) at Cornell University and Boyce Thompson 
Institute is sponsoring undergraduate summer internships in Ithaca, New York.  
Internships are 8-10 weeks in length in one of the participating labs currently doing 
plant genome research.  Interns will be mentored by a graduate student or post-doctoral 
associate and will work with their mentors on a project related to plant genomics.  
They will learn the latest in molecular biology techniques, and depending on the lab, 
may also participate in fieldwork.  All students will be attending lab meetings, 
reading and discussing recent literature related to their project, and will present 
their research to the other students, principal investigators, and mentors at our 
summer student symposium.  Students must be either US citizens or permenant US residents.  
For participation in the program, student interns will be provided a stipend, housing, 
and some travel expenses.

are due postmarked by March 1, 2006.
