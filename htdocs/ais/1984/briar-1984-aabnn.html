INTRODUCTION<p>

A. thaliana has been chosen as one of the specimen plants for growth
in the European Space Agency Eureca Botany Facility. I am planning an
experiment to determine the influence of microgravity in cellular
development and differentiation using, as a model system in the Botany
facilty, the developing embryos of A. thaliana. Such a study requires
the remote fixation for electron microscopy of the growing material in
orbit, with subsequent recovery perhaps several weeks later. These
constraints, together with the limits set on experiment size, require
the development of novel fixation procedures, and work is under way to
determine the response of the plant to such procedures.<p>

Perhaps the most limiting of the constraints is on the volume of
fixative than can be carried; if it were possible to immerse the
plants completely in normal fixative solution it is likely that the
subsequent fixation image would be adequate. The alternative to liquid
fixation is to use a vapour phase fixative, a technique which has been
used for some time in light microscope histochemistry for the fixation
of freeze-dried material (Pearse, 1980). Of the available vapour phase
fixatives tried so far (acrolein, formaldehyde, OsO 4) acrolein has
proved to be the most effective; it penetrates tissue rapidly and has
a high vapour pressure (0.276 bar at 20*degrees*C).<p>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<p>

Intact, flowering plants (form mutant line F116 from AIS) growing in
small containers in peat-based compost were placed in 11 capacity
sealed preserving jars and allowed to equilibrate for 24 hours. To
each jar 5ml of acrolein in a small vial was added, and the jars were
maintained in diffuse daylight at room temperature.<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

Plants in acrolein vapour showed no apparent change, remaining erect
and turgid; after 24 hours drops of water were evident all over the
leaves, fruits and stems and these remained present throughout the
observation period. Bleaching of the chlorophyll was the only evident
change after two to three months. Fruits were harvested at various
periods up to 12 weeks post-fixation. embryos, dissected from their
testas, were post-fixed in 2% 0s0 4 in 0.025M pH7 phosphate buffer,
then carried through a standard alcohol dehydration and epoxy
embedding.<p>

The overall fixation image of developing cotyledon cells after 24
hours fixation was similar to that of standard glutaraldehyde-fixed
tissue; all cytoplasmic organelles were well preserved and
recognisable, though the internal membranes of plastids and
mitochondria were not well retained, showing up in negative contrast
against the darker matrix. The general appearance of the tissue at low
power was comparable to that of the control material, through higher
magnification showed some clumping of ribosomes and ground cytoplasm
components. Membane damage (e.g., to the tonoplast in vacuolate cells)
was no worse than in the controls.<p>

After nine weeks in acrolein vapour (Figure 1a) there was little
change in the appearance of the cytoplasm, membrane contrast was
generally negative in plastids, mitochondria and ER, and there was
perhaps a little more clumping of the ribosomes and ground cytoplasm
components; the protoplast had pulled away from the cell walls in
places. All organelles remained recognisable, and the reserve lipid
droplets of the cotyledon cells seemed well-preserved (Figure 1b).<p>

These preliminary studies have shown that acrolein vapour is an
effective fixative at the ultrastructural level for intact, growing
fruits of A. thaliana. It penetrates adequately (there is no
degradation of the cells situated at the centre of semi-mature
cotyledons), and the material remains stable in it for at least nine
weeks at room temperature. It therefore merits consideration as a
fixative for remote application such as in the Eureca Botany Facilty,
where manipulation of the material is difficult or impossible, and
where its revovery for further processing may be delayed. Studies are
currently under way to determine in more detail the suitability of
acrolein and other vapour phase fixatives for this application.<p>
