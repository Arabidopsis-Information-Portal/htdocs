During the 2nd International Symposium on Arabidopsis Research in
September 1976 only a small number of selected but typical samples of
the AIS-seed bank were demonstrated by slides and living material in
the glasshouses at Frankfrut/Main (Kranz, 1976). Furthermore, in
August 1978 a demonstration of new and additional population (wild
races) and mutant (selected genotypes) samples was held during a
workshop on Arabidopsis genetics associated with the 14th
International Congress of Genetics at Moscow. This valuable material
is based mainly on the well known collection of F. Laibach, G.
Robbelen, D. Ratcliffe, and C. Gomez-Campo; further material was added
by our group at Frankfurt since 1974.<p>

The aim of this contribution is to present a complete documentation of
this material in addition to the short reports of G. Robbelen (1965a)
on the Laibach standard collection of natural races and of D. Burger
(1971) on the morphological and seed colour mutants at Gottingen. In
order to facilitate the orientation of the variable samples the
following lists were computed on different key characters for the
population material on the one hand and for the mutant lines on the
other hand. The denotations and explanations are mostly given in
agreement with those handed over to us by G. Robbelen. They are
numbered and thus they can be extended on each level of
classification. Leaf colour mutants were designated additionally by
using the terminology of H. Lamprecht and following the proposals of
A.J. Muller (1964) and of G. Robbelen (1965b). For the morphological
mutant lines latin names were given in agreement with the main groups
of the classification system of D. Burger (1971). Symbols and names of
genes are those offered by G.P. Redei and A.D. McKelvie (1965) and
were used only for those lines which were tested in genetic
experiments. The data presented illustrate by example the principles
of classification which are applied to data processing of the AIS-seed
bank in total.<p>

Further purpose of the following presentation is to inform everybody
interested in this subject on its enormous variability, to enable
researchers to select the material suited for their experiments, to
eliminate misdesignations by this uniform and handsome classification
of the seed samples, and last not least to stimulate the conservation
of wild races of those regions of the northrn hemisphere not to be
considered as well as the screening of unusual, new mutant types.<p>

The AIS-seed bank is open to all informations on new material and to
stock exchange. Small seed samples of the populations and the mutant
lines, the older as well the new ones, can be received by request to
the author.<p>
