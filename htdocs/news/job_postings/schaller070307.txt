Postdoctoral Positions in Cytokinin Signal Transduction


Full Description:
Postdoctoral positions are currently available in the laboratory of Dr. G. Eric 
Schaller (Dartmouth College) to work on USDA and NSF funded projects in 
cytokinin signal transduction. The USDA project focuses on the role of the type-
B response regulators, which act in the final step of the cytokinin signaling 
pathway to regulate the transcriptional response to cytokinin. The NSF 2010 
project focuses on defining the network of interactions by which cytokinin 
regulates plant growth and development, and includes the analysis of additional 
transcription factors as well as proteins interacting with the primary signaling 
pathway. Opportunities exist to extend research from Arabidopsis into rice. 
Opportunities also exist to participate in a multi-institutional collaborative 
research environment, as we share periodic group meetings with the Kieber lab of 
North Carolina. Successful applicants should be highly motivated, be capable of 
working independently, and have a relevant PhD. Experience in some or all of the 
following disciplines is desirable: genetics in model systems, molecular 
biology, and/or biochemistry. I will be available to discuss these projects at 
the ASPB meeting in Chicago and the IPGSA meeting in Mexico.
