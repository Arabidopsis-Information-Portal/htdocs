Doctoral Fellowships for Biological Studies at the University of Louisiana

The Department of Biology has fellowships available in January 2012 for doctoral students
interested in their degree program in Environmental and Evolutionary Biology. Fellowships
carry full tuition waivers and stipends between $16,000 (9 months) and $26,000 (12 months).
More information about graduate admission and fellowship application and other financial
support can be found at http://biology.ucs.louisiana.edu/content/admission . Fellowship
funding is generally restricted to US citizens and permanent residents. Fellows typically
have GPAs above 3.50 and combined GRE scores above 1200 although exceptions can be made
for applicants with strong research backgrounds. Other sources of funding are available
to international applicants. I am recruiting potential fellows to work in my research
program in the genetics of bioenergy crops. Please contact me ( yxw9887@louisiana.edu )
if you are interested.
