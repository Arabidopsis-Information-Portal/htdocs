It has been reported that 1,4-bisdiazoacetylbutane (BDAB) induced
mainly gene mutation (RAPOPORT and ZOZ, 1962) and 8-ethoxycaffeine
(EOC) induced mainly chromosome aberrations (EHRENBERG, 1956).  We
expected that applying of these mutagens would be useful for the
elucidation of the nature of embryonic lethals.<p>

Seeds presoaked for 8 hrs were treated for 18 hrs with BDAB (1%) at
25*degrees*C or with EOC (0,025 M) at 12*degrees*C.  Seedlings were
treated for 18 hours with BDAB (0.15%) or with EOC (0.025 M).  Aseptic
and soil cultures were grown under continuous luminescent illumination
at 24-26*degrees*C.  Percentage of survival after BDAB treatment of
seeds was 72%, that of seedlings 77%; after EOC treatment - 98% and
71%, respectively (control 98%).  Five siliquae per plant were scored
according to the procedure of MULLER.<p>

The siliquae which contained underdeveloped ovules were divided into 3
classes according to the ratio of underdeveloped ovules to the total
number of the ovules: (I) greater than or equal to 1/10; (II) 1/11 to
1/20; (III) less than 1/20  The total spontaneous frequency of plants
which had siliquae with underdeveloped ovules was 60%; the total
spontaneous rate of underdeveloped ovules was 0.75%; 70% of these
belonged to class III, 30%-to Class II and only 1-2%- to class I.
After the treatment of seeds and seedlings with BDAB and EOC the rate
of class II and III ovuls did not increase.<p>

The table demonstrates that BDAB and EOC induced low frequency of
lethals of class I-2.3 and 2.6% per plants and 0.18 and 0.14% per
ovules, respectively. The hereditary nature of the lethals of class I
was confirmed in M3.  Because of the low mutagenic effect of BDAB and
EOC we cannot make the conclusion about the nature of embryonic lethal
mutations.<p>
