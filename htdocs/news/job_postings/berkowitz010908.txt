Postdoc Position: Patch clamp electrophysiologist 
 
 
 
A scientist with prior patch clamp experience (including use of PClamp 
for current analysis) is sought to join a group characterizing plant 
calcium-conducting cyclic nucleotide gated channels. Channel properties 
as well as the role the channels play in plant innate immune signaling 
will be the focus of the research. The project will involve channel 
recordings from native plant cell membranes, as well as from oocytes and 
HEK cells expressing channel constructs. The scientist will have an 
opportunity to learn molecular biology research approaches, as well as 
training in use of any of the channel characterization systems. Salary: 
approximately $40-45,000 depending on experience. Contact: Gerry 
Berkowitz (gberkowi@nsf.gov).  Berkowitz is currently a Program Director 
at the National Science Foundation (Washington D.C. area) but directs a 
research program at the home institution: University of Connecticut, 
Agricultural Biotechnology Laboratory, Storrs, CT, USA.
