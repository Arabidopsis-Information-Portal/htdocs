Post-doc position in small RNA-guided gene regulation in plants 
Oklahoma State University 
Dept. of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
 
JOB DESCRIPTION:  
  
Regulation of gene expression at the transcriptional level plays a central role and 
determines developmental and physiological processes in eukaryotes.  The importance of 
posttranscriptional gene regulation has been only recognized recently with the discovery 
of microRNAs (miRNAs) and small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Research in the 
laboratory is directed to identify and understand the roles of endogenous small RNAs 
(microRNAs and small-interfering RNAs) in plant development and stress responses. We 
seek a creative and motivated candidate with a Ph.D. in Plant Molecular Biology or 
related filed. Experience in plant stress physiology is plus but not required. The 
successful candidate must be able to independently design and conduct experiments, and 
willing to work on other projects in the laboratory. Interested applicants should send a 
CV, brief summary of research experience, and names and email addresses of at least 
three referees preferably by email to  
ramanjulu.sunkar@okstate.edu.
