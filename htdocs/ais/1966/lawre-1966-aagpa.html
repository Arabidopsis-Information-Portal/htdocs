	Bench top trays, 3-5 metres x 2 metres x 15 centimetres deep, lined with polyethylene sheet in which a few holes have been punched, are used.  Approximately 5 cm of coarse gravel are placed at the bottom and covered by 10 cm of Joyn Innes potting compost No. 1 which is firmed down lightly and evenly (important).  The compost is covered by a thin layer of very finely sieved compost. Water is introduced directly into the gravel layer, allowed to soak up into the soil and then allowed to drain away. The soil should be very moist at sowing time.<p>

	Seeds are placed on moist filter paper in petri dishes, allowed to imbibe for about an hour at room tmperature and then stored at 1-2*degrees*C for 3-4 days.  Often this cold treatment is not necessary, but if given routinely, it ensures even germination.  After cold treatment, seeds are laid with the aid of a fine paintbrush on the surface of the soil at the bottom of small depressions (finger tip size).  A spacing of 3-4 cm within rows and 5 cm between rows is usually adequate.  Plot lables or similar means of identification of different families should be as short as possible since their shadows can cause uneven growth.<p>

	After sowing, the tray is covered with a frame draped with fine muslin.  The muslin is kept damp during the germination period to ensure high humidity at the soil surface, and is removed after the cotyledons have expanded, to avoid etiolation. During the early stages of growth all watering is carried out as described above, but mature plants can be watered normally.<p>

	Germination under these conditions is even, and 95% or more seeds give rise to mature plants.  Occasionally algae start to grow on the soil after sowing, especially if the soil is over wet, but are quickly killed by allowing the soil surface to dry, and therefore do not harm.  It is unnecessary to water frequently and it is possible to maintain a fairly dry soil surface with adequate moisture for good growth at the bottom of the tray.  Large trays take up to 4000 plants.<p>
