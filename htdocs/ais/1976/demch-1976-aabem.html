In recent years, tissue culture has been used more and more frequently
in genetic experiments, but do morphological changes arise during in
vitro morphogenesis, that is, from callus formation to
redifferentiation of whole plants?  If there are, the use of
regenerated plants for genetical investigation will be limited.<p>

Fortunately, it is possible to follow the fate of certain genomes
under the conditions of callus induction and subsequent regeneration
(Demchenko, et al., 1973 and 1975; Dulieu, 1971; Kamja, 1975).  We
studied the genotypical stability of Arabidopsis in two naturally
occurring races, Enkheim and Columbia, and in the lines with the
markers, gl, gl1an, and vc2er. We could easily observe the fate of the
marker gene under the conditions of redifferentiation, since each line
is characterized by typical morphological traits, and since the
naturally occurring races are carriers of the wild alleles of the
mutant genes mentioned below:<p>

a.  Glabra is a mutation (chromosome III) responsible for a complete
lack of pubescence on the upper side of the leaf, with only a few
hairs occurring on the edge of the leaf blade and on the stem.<p>

b.  Angulosa is a mutant gene (chromosome 1) responsible fo the
appearance of extended leaves with a smooth transition from the leaf
petiole to the blade, with notched edges.<p>

c.  Virescens is a mtuant gene (chromosome III) which leads to the
absence of roundish leaves.<p>

d.  Erecta is a mutation (chromosome II) responsible for the upright
habit of the plant, bristling rosette leaves, and pods.<p>

Plants wre aseptically grown in test tubes until the rosette stage.
Leaves (with petioles) were transferred into test tubes into Gamborg
agar medium supplemented with IAA and kinetin (1/mg).  The test tubes
were then placed at 25*degrees*C, 70% humidity, and in the dark.<p>

Differences among the lines were soon apparent. Whereas Enkheim and
gl1 an developed an actively growing callus with few root hairs, gl,
vc2er and Columbia races developed a callus with numerous and separate
root hairs.  Organogenesis also varied with the different genotypes.
Calluses of Enkheim and gl1 were found to regenerate stems. The other
varieties had poor stem regeneration, but good root regeneration
(Table 1).<p>

Stem buds were then isolated and placed into test tubes on Gamborg
medium, but without kinetin or IAA.  On this medium the different
varieties showed the same tendency, i.e., rooting was more active with
the variety (68%) and gl1 an (25%).  It is obvious that no
generalization can be made and for each line the medium must be
specific to enhance the regeneration process.<p>

From the excellent regeneration results that we obtained with the
Enkheim and gl1 an lines, we were able to confirm that in vitro
morphogenesis does not seem to create genotypical changes.  Since the
plants were regenerated twice, from explants and from stem buds, it
has been possible to compare them twice with the original plants.
Comparison was made when the plants were at the floral stage. The
results (Table 1) indicate that none of the regenerated plants
displayed any morphological change in the traits studied.  A third
comparison was made possible by growing the progeny of each
regenerated plant in soil and comparing them with control plants.  In
no instance were there any morphological differences betwen the two
groups (Figure 1).<p>

In summary, there were differences in regenerative ability among
naturally occurring lines and mutant lines of Arabidopsis, but the
lines themselves remain genotypically stable during the process of in
vitro differentiation, which permits the use of plant tissue culture
for genetic experiments.<p>
