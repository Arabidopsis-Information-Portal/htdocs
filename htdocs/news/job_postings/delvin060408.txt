Role of FHY3 and FAR1 in transcriptional regulation of circadian clock resetting by red 
light
Ref KB/4985
Applications are invited for a Postdoctoral Research Assistant to work in the School of 
Biological Sciences, Royal Holloway University of London, under the supervision of Dr 
Paul Devlin.
Salary for this post is £25,136 per annum inclusive of London Allowance. The post is 
available after the 1st July 2008 and is for 36 months.
The project involves investigation of the role of two transcription factors, FHY3 and 
FAR1, in light input to the plant circadian clock. This is a collaborative project with Dr 
Haiyang Wang, Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research, Ithaca, NY and will also 
involve spending three months at The Boyce Thompson Institute. For background 
information, see Allen et al., 2006, Plant Cell, 18, 2506-2516 and Lin et al., 2007, 
Science, 318, 1302-5.
The investigation will involve a range of techniques including luciferase imaging; in vivo 
binding and activation assays; inducible expression analysis; mutant studies; promoter 
dissection; and protein interaction studies.
Candidates will have a PhD in Plant Molecular Biology, or will have submitted a thesis 
prior to taking up the appointment. A background in plant molecular genetics and a 
strong interest in circadian biology are essential. Experience in any of the techniques 
involved would also be an advantage.
Informal enquiries should be addressed to Dr Paul Devlin paul.devlin@rhul.ac.uk
