Postdoctoral Research Associate
Flower development
University of South Carolina

A postdoctoral position is available immediately to study the role of AINTEGUMENTA (ANT) and 
AINTEGUMENTA-like (AIL) proteins in floral organ initiation and growth in Arabidopsis thaliana 
(Nole-Wilson, et al., 2005, Plant Mol. Biol. 57, 613-628). This work will involve using DNA 
microarrays and chromatin immunoprecipitation to identify downstream targets of these 
transcription factors. A Ph.D. and experience in molecular biology, genetics, and biochemistry 
is required. Experience with DNA microarrays and/or ChIP is highly desirable. Interested 
candidates should email a cover letter, CV, and the names and addresses of three references 
to Beth Krizek at krizek@sc.edu.
