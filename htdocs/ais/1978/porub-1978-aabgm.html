Alleles of three of the altogether seven loci used as markers for
measuring the adaptive values of the three corresponding genotypes in
experimental A. thaliana populations (Svoboda and Cetl, 1977) were
studied not only in their own genetic background in which
corresponding mutant alleles had been induced originally but also in a
partially altered genetic background. The aim was to determine
possible effects of such an alteration upon adaptive values of
genotypes and their vitality and fertility components due to the
presence of modifying genes in the altered genetic background. The
mutant allele chm3 was induced in the S96 genetic background while,
respectively, the mutant alleles lc and L5 were introduced in the
Dijon-G genetic background. To obtain the experimental material
necessary, the plants of all three mutant stock lines were crossed
with the two standard stock lines so that all t = o plants were
heterozygous for the mutant alleles and, in addition, a portion of the
material with altered genetic background also for all differential
genes of the S96 and Dijon-G lines. In the material with altered
background, the t = 1 plants thus carried 50 p.c. of their own genetic
background while the other 50 p.c. originated from the alien line, on
an average.<p>

In the experimental populations with lc, no significant changes were
observed in the adaptive values of the two homozygotes if the genetic
background was altered. In the experimental populations with L5, the
alteration of the genetic background diminished the adaptive values of
the two homozygotes significantly. The decline of the adaptive value
of the +/+ homozygote from .7404 to .3250 allowed to predict the
population attaining equilibrium in the condition of balanced
polymorphism. In experimental populations with chm4, the alteration of
the genetic background led to an increase in the adaptive value only
in the +/+ homozygote. Results are given in Table 1.<p>

and adaptive values (w1, w2) of the two homozygotes, ++ and mm, in
experimental populations carrying marker alleles on the proper and
partially altered genetic background.<p>

Averages of the v, f, and w values for the S96 vs. Dijon-G lines on
one hand and for the proper vs. alien background on the other hand
were calculated (Table 2). It seems unimportant whether the genetic
background be proper or alien. The role of the two lines used as
donors of the genetic background seems to be more important. The
genetic background from the Dijon-G line may increase the adaptive
values and their components in the two homozygots as compared with
that from the S96 line.<p>

mm, in experimental populations carrying marker alleles on different
genetic background.<p>

Further experiments are necessary with entirely altered genetic
background as well as with a larger number of different markers and
genetic backgrounds. Our Drosophila experiments (Porubova,
unpublished) confirm that it is possible to search systematically for
standard genotypes whose genetic background enhances or suppresses the
degree of the selection advantage of heterozygotres.<p>
