<h2> Mutation induction by alkylating agents: Post-treatment storage of soaked seeds</h2><p>

Arabidopsis seeds treated with solutions of chemical mutagens can be
stored in water if germination is inhibited by anaerobiosis.  It has
been shown previously (MULLER, 1965, 1966, 1967) that such
post-treatment "water storage" for 2 days does not alter significantly
the frequency of mutations induced by monofunctional alkylating
agents.  These results suggest that mutation induction is the
consequence of alkylation of nonreplicating DNA and that mutation
fixation is not detectably influenced by delaying the start of DNA
replication for 2 days.  Later we found that it is possible to apply
much longer periods of "water storage".  There are at least two
storage conditions under which the germinability of soaked seeds is
preserved for several weeks (at 24*degrees*C): (1) Strong anaerobiosis
created by submersion of seeds in N2 water (oxygen replaced by
nitrogen), or (2) holding the seeds in the dark.  (The obligate light
requirement for germination of strain "Dijon G" is fulfilled by a
short impulse of light.  If light is avoided from the beginning of
soaking, seeds do not germinate under aerobic conditions.)<p>

Seeds of strain "Dijon G" were presoaked for 12 hrs in N2 water and
treated for 3 hrs at 24*degrees*C with 60 mM ethyl methanesulfonate
(EMS), 30 mM methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), or 0.3 mM
N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNH).  After 5 min of washing, the seeds were
either germinated immediately or stored for periods of 2 to 20 days in
N2 water in the dark.  Germination was induced by spreading the seeds
on wet filter paper and exposing them to light. Germinated seeds were
transferred to soil and grown in the greenhouse.<p>

In all variants (with the exception of those treated with MMS) the
percentage of germinated seeds was 97-100% and the survival of M1
plants ranged from 85 to 95%.  (No significant difference as compared
with the control!)  After MMS treatment there was a storage-dependent
decrease of germination rate from 98% (no storage) to 68% (20 days
storage).  The frequencies of embryonic lethal and chlorophyll
mutations were determined by the embryo test, using one silique per M1
plant.<p>

The results (see Table) of the EMS and MMS experiments show that the
frequencies of both types of mutations are not significantly
influenced by storage.  As anaerobiosis should not inhibit hydrolytic
processes (as it does with enzymatic processes), this constancy of
mutation frequency indicates that hydrolytic degradation of alkylated
DNA is not involved in the formation of the mutations observed.  It is
well known from in vitro studies that methylation and ethylation of
DNA lead to depurination and backbone breakage (see RHAESE and FREESE,
1969).  These spontaneous changes of alkylated DNA are often discussed
as possible causes of mutation.  Our results suggest furthermore that
nongerminating seeds are unable to repair premutational lesions in
alkylated DNA, - a conclusion which is also supported by the results
of experiments with fractionated doses (MULLER, 1969).<p>

In an additional experiment, EMS treated seeds were stored aerobically
on wet filter paper for 20 days (no germination induction by light!).
Also under these conditions the mutation frequency remained constant
during storage.<p>

In the experiment with MNH we found a decrease of mutation frequency
during storage (see Table).  Although we cannot explain the difference
between MNH and the methanesulfonic esters as to the response to
storage, it should be mentioned that a mutation frequency decline is
not necessarily an indication of repair of lesions in the DNA.<p>
