In literature, up to now, most of the described morphological,
physiological und pigment mutations of Arabidopsis are recessive for
wild type. That shows that small possibility of arising non-recessive
hereditary alterations of characters found in Arabidopsis. Therefore,
the description of a semidominant pigment mutation designated below as
xav (from "xantha-variegation") is obviously of interest.<p>

xav mutation was selected when studying chimeras, induced by the
treatment of Arabidopsis seeds, race Enkheim, with the solution of
0.0045 volume percent of ethylene imine (Mednik and Usmanov, 1982).
During the embryo-test the pods were found to contain embryos of
"xantha" type and after sowing the seeds from these pods three
phenotypic classes were observed:<p>

a) plants of wild type;<p>

b) light-yellow seedlings dying at the stage of cotyledon leaves;<p>

c) vital plants with the yellow-green first pair of real leaves; in
ontogenesis this colouring is maintained up to the stage of buds and
in some plants up to the flowering stage involving about the half of
the diameter of the rosette, so that the centre of the rosette is
noticeable lighter than its distal part.<p>

Table 2: Segregation according to genotypes in vital progeny of
heterozygotes for xav.<p>

The embryo-test in fertile plants showed that in the wild type pods
only normal embryos occur, and in the pods of class c) we see
segregation for "xantha". Therefore, the character dependent on xa v
gene is inherited by incomplete dominant type and the mutation itself
is semidominant according to the norm. It is worth mentioning that the
expressivity of the mutant allele in the heterozygote rises with the
increase of the illumination and the penetrance was practically 100%;
out of 245 heterozygous plants 242 were of typical, yellow-green
colour in the centre of the rosette, and only 3 had the colouring of
the rosette leaves not very different from the norm.<p>

The mutant character in heterozygotes for xav is apparent only after
the formation of the first pair of real leaves, therefore,
heterozygous embryos do not differ from the normal ones. Taking into
account this aspect data from Tables 1 and 2 show that the segregation
in the progeny of the self fertilizing heterozygotes corresponds with
the monohybrid scheme of inheritance. A small deficit of mutant
embryos in the pods (23.8% instead of theoretical 25%, Table 1) is
rather due to a slightly lowered survival of the mutant homozygotes at
the embryo stage of the development.<p>

During the genetic analysis of more than 700 progeny plants of
heterozygous plants, no homozygotes for xav mutation were found; that
shows the absolute lethality of this mutation in the homozygote.
Homozygous embryos have pale yellow colour of "xantha" type and are
very easily distinguished from the normal ones during the embryo-test,
and being sown on the agar medium in Petri dishes they form light
yellow, almost white seedlings, dying at the state of cotyledon
leaves. Heterozygous plants are vital and do not differ from the
plants of wild type by their surviving ability both in aseptic and
soil culture (Table 2), but are inferior in a range of biological
indices.<p>

During the growth in the boxes with soil under the cover of gauze at
Sya-Kukh station (2500 m above sea level) heterozygous plants were
growing more slowly, than plants of the wild type; the approach of the
main ontogenetic phases was taking place 6-9 days later. The plant
height, the number of stems and side branches, the number of pods and
embryos in the pod of the heterozygotes were positively 10 to 35% less
than that of normal plants. The seed production was the least; we
obtained 1230 seeds in average per heterozygous plant versus 2310
seeds per plant of wild type.<p>

The most simple explanation of semidominance of the xav mutation is
the suggestion that the mutant allele codes for inactive protein and
that the amount of the active enzyme, produced in the heterozygote is
not enough for the formation of a normal phenotype. But in this case
it is hardly true, becaue our experience of dealing with tens of
lethal mutations of "albina", "xantha" and "chlorina" types tells us
that under ordinary conditions the heterozygotes of these mutations
are not distingishable from the norm by their phenotype. The mechanism
of dominance of the xav allele over the norm is obviously more
complex, and that is why the study of this mutation can give important
information for undertanding the dominance phenomena during the
ontogenetic formation of the photosynthetic apparatus in higher
plants. In this connection we continue the genetic study of this
mutant and also we started the investigation of some biophysical and
biochemical indices.<p>

The xav mutation can be used for the revealing of any lethal mutation
located in the same linkage group. Let us designate the totality of
the loci of this linkage group as X, and the concrete sets of the
alleles that are contained in the given linkage group in homologous
chromosomes of the plant studied as X 1 and X 2. The testing of lethal
mutations in X 1 and X 2 is carried out in three stages.<p>

2. During the growth of F 1 the plants with xa v/X1 and xa v/X2
genotypes are selected (They are easily distinguished by the colour of
the rosette) and after selfpollination the seeds are gathered
separately from each plant having the following genotypes:<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol19/vol19-pg91-fig0.gif">Click here for figure</a><p>

3. The seeds germinate in Petri dishes up to the stage of 2 to 4 real
leaves, at which the heterozygote for xav is easily distinguished
from the wild type. If there is a lethal mutation in X l which is
closely linked with the xav locus, then there won't be normal green
plants in the Petri dishes, as the Xl/Xl homozygote is lethal. If
there is not any lethal mutation in Xl or if it is located far from xa
v, the segregation according to the phenotypes "wild type"/yellow
green colouring will be 1:2. In the case of incomplete linkage the
proportion will be between 0:2 and 1:2. The decrease of the fraction
of plants with the wild phenotype indicates the presence of the lethal
mutation in X 1.<p>

Table 3 shows the fraction of genotypes (and phenotypes) in F 2
depending on the strength of the linkage (0 &lt;/= *zeta* &lt;/= 0.5)
between xav and the lethal mutation, and also the minimum size of the
sample in the second generation F 2 (n min), which allows the testing
of the lethal mutation with the given possibility.<p>

According to the well known formula *zeta*= 0.5((1-l)(-2d/100)) of
Stahl (1966) where *zeta* is the coefficient of the crossing over, d
is the length of the site of the chromosome in Morgan-units, we find
that if *zeta*=0.3 then 2d = 91 morgans (2d because the lethal mutations are
tested at both sides of the xav locus). For growing, amount of the F 2
plants necessary, (110-150 plants, Table 3), one Petri dish is quite
enough. Further increase of the size of the F 2 sample is not
advisable, because in order to lengthen the tested area twice as much,
for example, it is necessary to analyse 1343 plants in F 2, i.e. 10
times as many.<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol19/vol19-pg91-tab3.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

n min is the minimum size of the F 2 sample allowing at that value of
*zeta* less or equal the tabular value to test the lethal mutation with
the given probabiltiy; *zeta* is the coefficient of the crossing over.<p>

Theoretically it is possible to test lethal mutations according to the
same scheme, using an ordinary pigment lethal of "albina" or xantha"
type or vital morphological mutation (marker) instead of xa v. But
practically it is impossible in view of the great increase of the
amount of work. Then, it is necessary to analyse only 100 dishes with
seedlings in order to test 100 chromosomes with the help of xa v, and
when using "albina" and "xantha" it is nedcessary to carry out the
embryo test of 10 to 15 thousand plants, and when using a
morphological marker it is necessary to grow 10 to 15 thousand of
plants in F 2 and to identify their genotype according to the
segregation in F 3 (100 to 200 thousand of plants).<p>

Using xav makes the analysis easier because due to the semidominance
of this mutation the genotype of F 1 and F 2 plants is determined
directly by its phenotype.<p>

The testing of lethal mutations by the method described can be used
for the estimation of the mutagenic action of various substances,
physical and natural factors. Besides, it is the only possible
nowadays method of analysing the natural populations of Arabidopsis
for the presence of lethal mutations different from "albina",
"xantha", "chlorina" and embryonic lethals. But it should be mentioned
that practical application of this test system will be pssible after
the detailed analysis of its sensitivity in comparison with the method
of the embryo test.<p>
