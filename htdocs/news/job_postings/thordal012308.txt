At University of Copenhagen, Faculty of Life Sciences, Department of 
Agricultural Sciences wishes to appoint a postdoc in Defence Genetics 
with Hans Thordal-Christensen (htc@life.ku.dk) from 1st of April 2008 to 
31st of March 2010. 
 
The position concerns the interaction of plants and powdery mildew 
fungi, and is based on previous transcriptome analyses. These led to the 
discovery of a large collection of effector candidate sequences that are 
expressed in haustoria of a powdery mildew fungus. Such collections have 
previously been defined from pathogenic bacteria and oomycetes. The goal 
of the project is to understand how these effectors affect the plant 
cell, and thereby pave the way for fungal growth, or in rare cases 
become recognized and trigger plant disease resistance. 
 
The research activities will include: 
*       Heterologous expression of effectors in transgenic Arabidopsis 
*       Analyse the transgenic Arabidopsis for pathogen-related and 
physiological phenotypes 
*       Conduct protein-protein interaction studies using yeast 2-hybrid 
or similar 
 
The Defence Genetics group consists of a total of seven people. 
The position may include teaching to a limited extent. 
 
The position is financed by the Danish Agency for Science, Technology 
and Innovation. 
 
Employment and salary will be according to the Agreement between the 
Danish Ministry of Finance and the Danish Confederation of Professional 
Associations.
