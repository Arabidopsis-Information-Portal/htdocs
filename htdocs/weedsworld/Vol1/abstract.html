        To understand the control of spatial patterns of expansion, 
we studied root growth in wildtype and in the stunted plant 1 mutant, 
<I>stp1</I>, of<I>Arabidopsis thaliana</I>. We measured profiles of 
cell length and calculatedthe distribution of elongation rate. Slow 
growth of <I>stp1</I> results both froma failure of dividing cell 
number to increase, and from low elongation rates in the zone of 
rapid expansion. However, elongation of dividing cells was not greatly 
affected, and <I>stp1</I> and wildtype callus grew at identical
rates. Thus, rapid cellular expansion differs in mechanism from expansion
in dividing cells, and is facilitated by the STP1 gene. Additionally,
there was no difference between stp1 and wildtype roots for elongation in
response to abscisic acid, auxin, ethylene, and gibberellin, or for radial
expansion in response to ethylene; however, stp1  responded to cytokinin
much less than wildtype. By contrast, both genotypes responded comparably
to hormones when explants were cultured; in particular, there was no
difference between genotypes in shoot regeneration in response to
cytokinin. Thus,  effects on root expansion mediated by cytokinin, but not
effects mediated by other hormones, nor effects on other cytokinin-mediated
responses, require the STP1 locus. <P>
