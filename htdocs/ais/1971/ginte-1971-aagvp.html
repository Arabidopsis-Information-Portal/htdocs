In the present note general results are summarized of two independent
series of experiments, one using D/Be neutrons about 5.6 MeV (work
carried out in collaboration with Mrs. G. HABERER and coworkers from
the Institut fur Biophysik der Deutschen Akademic der Wissenschaft4n
zu Berlin), and the other using reactor neutrons about 2 MeV.  In both
cases air-dry dormant seeds of A. thaliana (L.) HEYNH., race En-1,
were irradiated and dose-response curves were determined for ten
end-points tabulated below. For the estimation of the RBE values of
neutrons the averaged dose-response data were used obtained in
numerous experiments with 0.1 MeV X- and 60Co gamma-rays. For each of
the end-points the RBE values were calculated as mean ratios of
isoeffective doses of X+gamma versus the correspondent neutron
irradiation thoughout the available range of response levels. The
obtained RBE-values are presented in the first two columns of the
following Table.<p>

The analysis of the data, presented in the table, reveals a close
agreement between the RBE values of neutrons determined in the two
completely independent series of experiments (rS = 0.70; P = 0.01 -
0.05), thus indicating the nonrandom nature of variation in the
RBE-values between the ten tested end-points.  This inference is still
strengthened by the absence of significant differences within the
correspondent pairs of neutron dose-response curves for any of the
end-points. Therefore in the last column of the Table mean values of
RBE of fast neutrons are calculated.<p>

At least two sources of differences in RBE of fast neutrons in
inducing diverse somatic and genetic effects may be suggested: (1)
quantitative and qualitative differences in the primary mechanisms,
responsible for the initiation of diverse end-responses, and (2)
pre-differentiation of the embryonic meristematic cell population into
vegetative and reproductive compartments, differing in their responses
to irradiation.<p>

A detailed description and discussion of the results will be published
elsewhere.<p>
