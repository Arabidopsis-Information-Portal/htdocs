INTRODUCTION<p>

In Arabidopsis many independently induced thiamine requiring mutants
have been isolated at several laboratories (Langridge, 1955; Redei,
1965; Feenstra, 1964, Jacobs, 1965). These were found to be mutants at
four different loci (py, tz, th-1 and th-2) at known positions on one
of the five Arabidopsis chromosomes. The phenotypes and nutritional
requirements of mutants of these loci, and their chromosome location,
is given in Table 1. The location of the genes has been confirmed at
our laboratory.<p>

Recently some of the genetic blocks could be specified more accurately
by biochemical techniques (Ledoux et al., 1980). Thiamine mutants of
Arabidopsis have been used for transformation experiments with
bacterial DNA (Ledoux et al., 1974). Some of the corrected strains
were variegated and some dispute arose about the genetic nature of
these corrected strains (Redei et al., 1977; Ledoux et al., 1979).
This paper described an EMS induced thiamine mutant, viable and
somewhat variegated and belonging to a locus not identified before.<p>

MATERIAL AND METHODS<p>

The mutant V345 (bottom of Table 1) was isolated in the M 2-progeny of
EMS treated seeds (10 mM, 24 h, 24*degrees*C) as a pale green
chlorophyll mutant which responded to thiamine. Py, tz and th-1
mutants were kindly provided by Feenstra, and the Langridge-mutant
1018-6 (=th-2) by Ledoux.<p>

a new locus ("th-3")<p>

Linkage analyses were based on repulsion phase digenic F2-populations.<p>

Nutritional requirements were tested in petri-dishes with perlite
saturated with a standard mineral solution. Specific chemical
compounds were added to this mineral solution. These were thiamine-HC1
(TH), 4-methyl-5-thiazole-ethanol (TZ) (Aldrich), and
4-am,,ino-5-aminomethyl-pyrimidine-di HC1 (PY) (Sigma). Final
concentrations were 10E-4 M.<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

The thiamine responsive mutant V345 behaves a monogenic recessive.
F1's of V345 with py, tz, th-1 and th-2 mutants showed normal
complementation to wildtype, indicating no allelism. Linkage analysis
of V345 relative to several chromosome 4 markers (Koornneef et al.,
1980) gave an estimate of the recombination percentage with ap-2 of
27.8 +/- 5.3 and, with cer-2 of 10.2 +/- 5.8. In repulsion phase
F2-populations with ag (282 plants) f ca (415 plants) no recombinants
were observed, so the location of V345 on chromosome 4 is close to f
ca and ag. None of the thiamine loci known so far had been mapped on
this chromosome (Table 1).<p>

V345 is a slow growing viable mutant. It does not so much resemble
mutants at the py, tz and th-1 loci, which have white or almost white
rosette leaves and are lethal, but rather resembles the th-2 mutants.<p>

When compared with seedlings of the th-2 mutant 1018-6, some
differences can be observed. With th-2, chlorosis develops on the
older leaves especially on the leaf base. The chlorophyll deficiency
in V345 is less pronounced and distributed rather irregular by over
the leaves. Giving a not very pronounced pale green to normal green
variegated appearance (Figure 1). Sometimes necrotic spots can be
observed.<p>

The growth of V345 and other thiamine mutants was compared on perlite
supplemented with different thiamine metabolites (Table 2).<p>

10*exp*4M TH, PY and TZ (see "Materials and Methods")<p>

It appears that in V345 growth and wildtype phenotype can be restored
completely by 10E-4M thiamine-HC1 and to a large extent, but not
completely by thiazole (Figure 2; Table 2). With the latter compound
the necrotic spots did not disappear in contrast to the plants that
received thiamine.<p>

The rather deleterious effect of the pyrimidine derivate in cases
where it cannot be converted to thiamine has also been observed by
Ledoux et al. (1979)<p>

The nutritional requirement of V345 lies somewhat between that of th-2
and tz-mutants. A small stimulating effect of thiazole for th-2
mutants has been reported before (Redei et al., 1977; Ledoux et al.,
1979). V345 is responding much better to this compound, but as
wildtype phenotype is not restored completely or nearly so by
thiazole, we tentatively propose the gene symbol th-3 instead of the
option tz-2. Further biochemical research as described by Ledoux et
al. (1980) may reveal the exact biochemical lesion.<p>

It is not clear why this mtuant has not been found by Feenstra or
Redei, who isolated more than 100 thiamine mutants. It might be that
this type escaped detection because its phenotype differs from most
other thiamine mutants. In this respect it may be relevant that th-2
mutants are found only in low frequencies by these authors (Feenstra,
pers. commun.; Li and Redei, 1969).<p>

SUMMARY<p>

An EMS induced, slightly pale green/normal green variegated and viable
mutant is described. Wildtype phenotype could be restored completely
by growing the mutant on a medium supplemented with thiamine and
partly when the medium was supplemented with thiazole. The mutant
represented a thiamine locus (th-3) not described before and which was
located on chromosome 4.<p>
