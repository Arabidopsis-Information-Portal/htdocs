Various statistical methods have been designed to assess the number of
genes controlling quantitative characters (Mather and Jinks, 1977).
There are also various biochemical methods available for estimating
the gene number of an organism. The quantity of cellular DNA provides
very unreliable information because of insufficient knowledge of the
fine organization of the genome (Walbot and Goldberg, 1979). A much
better method relies on the complexicity of the mRNA present in the
cells at particular stages (Kiper, Bartels; and Kochel, 1979).
Alternatively, a very simple mutation analysis is feasible if the
"average rate" of mutation per locus per generation is known (Redei
and Redei, in manuscript). Such information is available for the
various thiamine loci of Arabidopsis.<p>

The procedure is as follows: divide the number of independent
mutational events expressed at a particular developmental stage by the
average rate of mutation for specific loci, and the number of genes
mutable can be obtained. For example, in one experiment we observed a
0.47 frequency of mutations per genome in a generation, and the
average rate of mutation for 4 thiamine loci was 7.4 x 10E-5.
Therefore, the number of loci capable of mutation is approximately
0.47/(7.4 x 10E-5) = 6.351.<p>

Sometimes classification of the mutants may be difficult because more
than one type of mutation can occur simultaneously in the multicellula
diploid germline. In such a case the overall mutation frequency
estimate may be biased. The problem can be overcome by determining the
frequency of the non-mutant class. Since mutational events are
distributed according to the Poisson distribution, from the size of
the zero mutation class (eE-m), the average mutation frequency can be
obtained.<p>

In one experiment with a very heavy dose of mutagen, we found a zero
mutation class with a 0.071 frequency. Therefore, the average number
of mutations per family wa 2.645. Since the germline was represented
by four genomes, the average number of mutations per genome was
calculated to be 2.645/4 ~ 0.66. Consequently, the total number of
genes capable of mutation in this experiment was estimated to be
0.66/(7.4 x 10E-5_ ~ 8.919. This estimate is reasonably close to those
of Kiper, Bartels, and Kochel (1979) for barley and parsley, obtained
by other methods.<p>
