Reference 15 93 - Post-Doctoral position in plant shoot development

A post-doctoral position is available to carry out research on genetic regulation of shoot meristem function-leaf 
pattering interactions within the laboratory of Dr. Mary Byrne. Key components of this interaction include KNOX 
homeodomain transcription factor genes, that are required for meristem function, and the myb domain transcription 
factor ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1, which is required for leaf dorsoventral patterning. The research project will use 
genetic and molecular methods to isolate and define the function of additional components in the AS1-KNOX gene 
pathway. Further details of this project and other research opportunities in the same laboratory can be obtained 
from Dr. Mary Byrne (mary.byrne@bbsrc.ac.uk) and by visiting our web site http://www.jic.bbsrc.ac.uk/staff/mary-byrne/index.htm. 

Candidates should have, or expect shortly to receive, a PhD in biological sciences and have experience in 
genetics and /or developmental biology. Good communication and organisational skills with the ability to design, 
plan and interpret original experiments in an independent, innovative manner are essential. 

This is limited term contract where the appointment is expected to last for a period of two years. Salary on 
appointment will be within the range of £23,022 to £26,541 per annum (pay award pending). JIC offers a choice 
of a final salary and stakeholder pensions.
