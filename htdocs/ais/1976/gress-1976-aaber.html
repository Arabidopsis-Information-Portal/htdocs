INTRODUCTION<p>

Bacterial gene transfer and subsequent expression in eukaryotic cells
has been named transgenosis by Doy, Gresshoff and Rolfe (1973).
Transgenosis has been reported in bacteriophage (Merrill, Geier, and
Petricianni, 1971; Merrill, Geier, Rolfe, 1975; Johnson, Grierson and
Smith, 193; Gresshoff and Hess, 1976).  Transgenosis of
nitrogen-fixing genes from bacteria into a mycorhizal fungus has been
reported by Giles and Whitehead (1975).  Theoretical considerations
and aspects of transgenosis have been discussed by Gresshoff (1975).<p>

More recently, increased emphasis was given to transgenosis
experiments with genetically defined organisms, namely Drosophila
melanogaster (Germeraad, 1976), Chlamydomonas reinhardi (Gresshoff and
Hess, 1976) and Neurospora crassa (Angerbauer, 1976). Experiments with
Neurospora involved the transfer, expression, and the inheritance,
either chromosomally or extra chromosomally, of the Escherichia coli
tryptophan and lactose operons (Angerbauer, Teifel and Klingmuller,
personal communication, Ph.&#206;. thesis, 1976).<p>

The possible applications of plant protoplasts to crop improvement
have been discussed (Chaleff and Carlson, 1974; Scowcroft, 1975).
Techniques for the uptake of organelles (Bonnett and Eriksson, 1974),
bacteria (Davey and Cocking, 1974), and plant viruses (Takebe, Otsuki,
and Aoki, 1972) exist.  However, there are no published attempts to
demonstrate bacteriophage uptake into plant protoplasts, although
Carlson (Carlson, 1973) demonstrated phage T3 expression but not
uptake.<p>

Here we report studies on the uptake of bacteriophages *lambda* cI857
and T4rII into protoplasts of Arabidopsis thaliana cell line ANU-CW-1.<p>

Materials and Methods<p>

Protoplast isolation (see Gresshoff, this AIS issue).  Bacterial
strain used was W3110 (Rolfe, Dykhuizen, and Campbell, in press).
Media and plating procedures followed standard techniques with slight
modification (see Rolfe and Campbell, 1973).<p>

Suspension cultures characterized by large (Arabidopsis seed-sized)
clumps were maintained in ASM2 (ACM2 [Gresshoff, this issue of AIS])
but without agar at 25*degrees* at 120 to 150 rpm in dark.
Subculturing was every 4 days.<p>

Washing procedures involved the taking of aliquots from a protoplast
or suspension culture, centrifuging at 300 g for 3 minutes, followed
by resuspension in fresh PDB (Gresshoff, this AIS issue).  Phage
titers in supernatant or pellet fractions were adjusted to a one ml
basis.<p>

Phage uptake by protoplasts was stimulated by poly-L-ornithine or
polyethylene glycol MW1540. The poly-L-ornithine procedure involved
pretreatment of protoplasts for 15 minutes followed by the addition of
bacteriophage and a further 15 minute incubation.  Subsequent washing
procedures were as described above.  PEG1540 stimulation experiments
used a co-incubation of protoplasts and phage in 30% (W/v) PEG1540 in
10 mM kH2PO4, 1mM CaCl2 at 25*degrees* for 2 minutes after which there
was a slow dilution by PDB over a period of 10 minutes. The slow
dilution was found to be essential for protoplast survival after
exposure for PEG1540. After the incubation in 30% PEG for 2 minutes,
protoplasts were pelleted at 150 g for 5 minutes and half the
supernatant replaced by fresh PDB followed by the gentle resuspension
of the pellet. This method was repeated three times and then the
washing procedures (described above) were caried out.<p>

Phage were isolated from cultured protoplasts in hanging drops
(Gresshoff, this issue AIS) by pooling three drops followed by two
successive washings in PDB, grinding the cellular pellet in dry ice,
plus 0.01 M tris MgSO4 buffer pH 7.2 for 5 minutes.  Phage titers were
determined in crude lysate.<p>

Results and Discussion<p>

Stability of phage *lambda* in suspension cultures of ANU-CW-1<p>

In order to determine the stability of bacteriophage in association
with plant cells, lambda phage was incubated in suspension of
Arabidopsis thaliana cell line ANU-CW-1. Viable phage were monitored
in the supernatant and cell pellet (after 10 successive days (Figure
1).  Negligible viable phage were found with cell pellets.  However,
the phage titer in the supernatant declined steadily over a period of
12 days, after which it reached a plateau of about 10 4 to 10 5 pfu
per ml of supernatant for the remainder of the experiment. This
contrasts with the observations of Smith (1975) who found that
*lambda*plac5 titers in sycamore suspension-cultures decreased
progressively. Similarly phage *phi*80 titers on cultured tomato callus
decreased without any observable plateau (Rolfe and Gresshoff,
unpublished data).  Because of retention of viable phage, this
suspension culture system may provide a more convenient approach for
the study of phage-mediated transgenosis of cultured plant cells.<p>

Bacteriophage T4rII and Protoplasts<p>

To investigate the effect of cell wall removal on bacteriophage plant
cell interaction, protoplasts of ANU-CW-1 callus were mixed with
phages T4rII and *lambda*cI857. The results for both phages were
essentially the same, thus only data from phage T4rII-ANU-CW-1
interactions are reported. The control experiments of the washing
procedures described in the Materials and Methods are shown in Figures
2 and 3. Figure 2 shows the loss of phage T4rII from the supernatants
of successive washings while Figure 3 shows the retention of phage in
the protoplast pellet.  High titers in early washings of pellets
represent contaminating phage particles which are readily removed by
wash number 6 (see Figure 2 wash 6 supernatant contains about 10 1 pfu
per ml).  Interestingly, in unstimulated phage-protoplast experiments
the background association plateau of about 10 3 pfu per ml was found
(Figure 3). This could not be lowered by additional washings and
therefore this level is thought to represent spontaneous uptake or
trapping of phage particles in the protoplast pellet.<p>

To possibly increase phage uptake, poly-L-ornithine and PEG540 were
added to phage-protoplast mixtures.  Poly-L-ornithine has been
previously shown to stimulate virus uptake (Takebe, Otsuki, and Aoki,
1972), while PEG1540 was shown to stimulate aggregation and uptake of
a variety of particles (Bonnett and Eriksson, 1974; Vasil and Giles,
1975; and others).  PEG1540 is also known as a fusion inducing agent,
as shown by Kao, Constable, Michayluk, and Gamborg, (1974) and Wallin,
Glimelius, and Eriksson (1974); and was also found to fuse protoplasts
of ANU-CW-1, using the methods for phage uptake stimulation (Materials
and Methods).<p>

The level of viable phage uptake or tight association to protoplast
pellets was determined by washing procedures, as described above. The
plateau level between washes number 6 and number 10 was taken as an
indicator of irreversibly associated viable phage. The stimulation of
phage T4rII uptake by poly-L-ornithine is shown in Figure 4. The
optimum stimulation occurred at 10 micro g/ml of poly-L-ornithine
which represents an approximate uptake of one to ten viable phage per
protoplast. Significantly higher recoverable phage were found after
treatment with PEG1540 (Figure 5).  Optimum uptake of phage occurred
with 30% to 40% PEG1540 representing an average uptake of 10 3 pfu per
protoplast.  However, the high association of viable phage with the
protoplast pellet following 40% PEG1540 treatment was thought to
represent trapping of phage rather than uptake, because of substantial
loss of protoplast integrity.  Conversely, 30% PEG1540 treatment did
not decrease viability and integrity of the protoplasts and therefore
the recoverable viable phage presumably represents phage associated
with the protoplasts either by uptake or tight association with the
membrane. The fusion inducing property of PEG1540 may enhance the
uptake by "sandwiching" phage particles between protoplasts.<p>

titers were determined by considering the plateau level between the
sixth and tenth washings.<p>

Protoplast titer was adjusted to 5 x 10 5/ml.  Phage titers determined
as for Figure 4.<p>

To study the stability of phage T4rII in cultured protoplasts ANU-CW-1
(for culture method, see Gresshoff, this issue AIS), protoplasts were
treated with phage T4rII and PEG1540 at 30%. These protoplasts were
washed 10 times to remove exogenous phage particles and then cultured
in hanging drops as described previously.  At daily intervals three
drop samples were monitored for viable phage (Figure 6).  Viable phage
were recovered at progressively lower levels over a period of 6 days,
after which no viable pfu were detected.  Over the same period of
culture the protoplasts regenerated a cell wall and appeared under
light microscopy to be viable.  These data suggest that complete phage
cannot survive for long periods in plant protoplasts.  However,
whether this represents a total digestion of phage particles or a
removal of phage structures required for bacterial infections has to
be determined by molecular methods.  It is hoped that the protoplast
system may provide insight into the phenotypic expression of phage
carried bacterial genes, such as the lactose operon, suppressor tRNA,
and chloramphenicol resistance.<p>
