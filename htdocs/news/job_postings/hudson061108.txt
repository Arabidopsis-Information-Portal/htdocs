A postdoctoral research position and graduate student assistantship are
available immediately as part of the Feedstock Genomics program of the
Energy Biosciences Institute at the University of Illinois,
Urbana-Champaign.

Both positions are to develop bioinformatics tools and to perform sequence
assembly, analysis and visualization on resource-poor species utilizing
next-generation sequencing techniques. The focus of the analysis will be on
forthcoming sequences from Miscanthus, Sugar Cane and other Andropogoneae
grass species with potential as lignocellulosic feedstocks. For the
postdoctoral position, experience with plant genome sequence analysis is
essential, and high throughput bioinformatics analysis skills are highly
desirable. For the graduate assistantship a strong interest in computational
biology and a background (MS preferred or BS) in either computer science or
biology is necessary.

The Andropogoneae Feedstock Genomics program is a collaboration between the
laboratories of Steve Moose, Ray Ming and Matt Hudson at the University of
Illinois, and Dan Rokhsar at the DoE Joint Genome Institute. The successful
candidates for these positions will be located at the Urbana-Champaign
branch of the Energy Biosciences Institute, which is funded by BP, plc.
