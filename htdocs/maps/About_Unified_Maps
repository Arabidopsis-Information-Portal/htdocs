The Unified-* maps are the current best estimate of an integrated
Arabidopsis map. As more validation is performed a new version of
the integrated map will be created.
.   
These maps have been produced in collaboration with David Meinke who
has graciously volunteered to coordinate genetic mapping as genetic
map curator for the Arabidopsis community. The unified map will be
modified as new data becomes available. If you have mapping data you
would like to contribute (population or pairwise data) please contact
the AAtDB curators at curator@frodo.mgh.harvard.edu and we will assist
you.
.   
The current version of the unified map is based on the following data.
.   
(1) All of the population and pairwise recombination data used to
generate the 1.0_Integrated map (Hauge et al., 1993).
.   
(2) David Meinke's embryo defective pairwise recombination data.
.   
Plus the following fixed orders:
.   
Chromosome I:
an act1 ch1
an act1 ap1
fha ga4 dis2
tt1 chl3 ch1
an dis1 emb30
emb76 an dis1
.   
Chromosome II:
as emb18 cer8
as emb111 cer8
er emb152 as
er cop1 as
.   
Chromosome IV:
bp cer2 emb104
bp ara1 cer2
ap2 fwa ga5 cer2
cer2 emb20 ap2
