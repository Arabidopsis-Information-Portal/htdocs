A *2 year postdoctoral position* is available to conduct identification of *plant proteins involved in 
long distance movement of plant viruses*.  Two viruses displaying different plant tissue tropism 
(potyvirus and polerovirus genera) will be the focus of this study. By constructing a cDNA library 
after collection of companion cells by *laser dissection *and screening the library using the yeast 
two-hybrid system with appropriate viral proteins, candidates potentially involved in virus systemic 
movement will be identified. Functional analysis of the proteins will be undertaken. This project 
should shed light on a non-completely elucidated process which is a major step in viral plant 
dissemination. A *data base* of genes expressed in companion cells will also be engineered and 
will represent an important tool for the scientific community studying phloem functions. 
 
This project is part of a main ANR project conducted in collaboration with *three laboratories*: 
*IBMP-CNRS in Strasbourg* (Véronique Ziegler-Graff), *INRA in Bordeaux* (Frédéric Revers) 
and *INRA in Colmar* (Véronique Brault). 
Applicants should have a PhD and good knowledge in molecular biology. 
Skills in virology (plant or animal) is desirable but not obligatory. 
Preference will be given to candidates with experience in engineering cDNA libraries and 
bioinformatics. Applications will be accepted until the position is filled
