Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) HEYNH. was chosen as model plant to study
the genetic system of flowering time (start of flowering) and, often
closely correlated to it, number of rosette leaves (vegetative
production).  The duration of the vegetative phase is of interest from
the point of view of both natural selection (local adaption) and
artificial selection (plant breeding).<p>

Genotypic variation was induced by seed treatment with EMS (ethyl
methanesulfonate) and with X-rays.  Two pure lines were used as
starting material, viz. the very early flowering Landsberg-'erecta'
(line C and a later flowering single gene mutant line derived from it
(line 51).  In total 24 flowering time mutants with good fertility and
vigour, and of independent origin, were obtained through sector
selection in M1 (for fertility) and individual plant selection in M2,
followed by line selection in M3 and further generations (for
flowering time and fertility).<p>

After grouping the 24 lines according to parent of origin, and
direction and magnitude of effect, diallel crosses (F1 and F2) were
made within groups, in order to identify the individual mutations by
means of classical Mendelian methods, rather than to describe and
analyse the induced quantitative variation by the statistical methods
of quantitative inheritance.  In nearly all cases, including the
small-effect lines, single gene differences with the parent of origin,
could be successfully identified with the experimental and analytical
procedures used for this purpose.<p>

The analysis of the flowering time mutants led to the following
conclusions: (1) No significant differences could be detected between
EMS and X-rays with respect to magnitude and direction of effect.
There is some indication that X-rays induce more (small-effect late)
dominant mutations.  With respect to mutant frequency at equal levels
of M2-fertility, EMS is 2 to 3 times as efficient as X-rays.<p>

(2) The majority of the mutant lines selected differ in one single
recessive gene; a few contain intermediates and a few contain
dominants.  All mutations identified are at different loci.  These
results have a number of practical implications: a) Mutant lines with
more than one gene mutation for flowering time appear to be relatively
rare, although such lines, if present, would have an increased
likelihood of being selected in M2 and later generations. b) As in
general flowering time mutants selected in M2 are single gene
homozygotes, at least when the mutations are recessives, no further
segregation will occur in M3.  This means that once individual plant
selection has been applied in M2, no within line selection for
flowering time is necessary in further generations. c) When no
large-effect mutants of the desired phenotype appear in M2, but only
small effect mutants in the desired direction, crosses can be made
already between individuals of different M2-lines, in order to obtain
recombinants with phenotypic effect of sufficient magnitude. This
procedure finds its justification in the fact that the M2-mutants
selected are most often single gene recessives, and in the fact that
the mutations are at different loci.<p>

(3) Mutagenic treatment of the medium early line 51 and of the late
mutant line CA (from our selections), releases variability in both
directions: towards early and towards late.  However, no earlier
mutant lines were obtained from the very early line C.  Moreover, line
C. did not respond to vernalization treatment, and early mutant
alleles when transferred to line C did not come to expression.
Therefore, it is concluded that line C represents a 'physiological
limit' towards early.<p>

(4) There was no evidence for allelism of mutations of independent
origin.  Several linkage groups were established (see HUSSEIN
elsewhere in this issue).  On the one hand, the loci for flowering
time in Arabidopsis are not distributed at random over the genome, on
the other hand they are not restricted to a few chromosome segments
either.<p>

(5) Except for occasional evidence for non-allelic interaction
(epistasis), the effects at the individual loci are additive over
loci.  Crosses between recessive and intermediates gave, in connection
with the relative magnitudes of the gene contrasts, interesting
numerical examples for the dominance theory of heterosis.<p>

(6) Pronounced genotype x environment interactions were frequently
met: homozygotes effect x season, dominance effect x season and also
genotype x bernalization x season interactions were described.<p>
