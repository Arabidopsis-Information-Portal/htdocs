Late mutants with vernalization requirement were induced in the early
race Dijon by HUSSEIN and Van Der VEEN (1965).  In our experiments
M2-populations of this race were cultivated after treatment with
N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MU) and *gamma* -irradiation at high
temperature (25+/-3*degrees*C) and under continuous illumination (1250
Lux).  These conditions are highly selective for the detection of
induced vernalization requirement.<p>

9 to 13 days after germination all of the untreated control plants
showed rosettes with 4 leaves and flower primordia.  In
M2-populations, however, many plants were found with a considerably
longer vegetative phase and a higher number of rosette leaves.  As the
time until the appearance of flower primordia was strictly correlated
with the number of rosette leaves, only the latter was evaluated.<p>

After *gamma*-irrdiation 73 late M2-plants (=7.1%) were registered in
44 out of 100 M1-progenies. After MU-treatment 124 out of 624
M2-plants (19.9%) were definitely later.  The number of plants with
one or more additional leaves is given in the following table:<p>

All together a slight developmental delay-equal to the middle early
natural races-was induced in 195 plants (11.8%), while 2 plants (0.1%)
were drasticaly changed and similar to late races with vernalization
requirement.<p>

The progenies of the selected late M2-plants were investigated under
the same culture conditions.  Because of this cultivation technique,
however, the number of seeds harvested in M2 was comparatively low.
Therefore, only 81 progenies with 6 or more plants could be evaluated
in the M3-generation.  In 13 progenies (16%) the recorded
developmental delay of the M2-plant proved not to be genetically
fixed; but in 68 progenies the changed phenotype reappeared.  58
progenies of the latter group segregated in respect to lateness, while
8 progenies (9.9%) were uniform.  In the segregating group, besides
the phenotype of the M2-plants, there were (a) plants identical with
the control in 43 progenies (53.0%) and (b) plants with larger
developmental delay than in M2 in 7 progenies (8.6%), while (c) 8
progenies (9.9%) were highly variable including the original M2-types
and later plants as well.  (d) In 2 progenies (2.5%) all of the M3
plants were later compared to the M2.  The correctness of the
classification in M3 was examined in a M4-generation cultivated under
the same conditions.  The high number of segregating progenies in the
M3 points towards the complexity of the genetic control of the number
of rosette leaves and the possibility of various types of mutation in
this typically developmental feature.<p>
