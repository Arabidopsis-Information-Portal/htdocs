INTRODUCTION<p>

Studying the winter-annual population from the slopes of the Bobrava
river valley, an apparently non-random distribution of winter-annual
and summer-annual genotpes was found in two similar transects along
inclination lines (Cetl, 1978a). This distribution pattern was
ascribed to the differences in microrelief, microclimate, and
accompanying plant species along the inclination lines, i.e., in the
vertical direction.<p>

It was suggested that more adequate material to understand the
internal differentiation of natural populations, the level of their
subdivision, and other attributes of the dispersive process
Arabidopsis thaliana, natural populations should be searched for
habitats more homogenous in respect to environment.<p>

MATERIAL AND METHODS<p>

Mature seeds of three summer-annual natural populations were collected
in almost plane biotopes with minimum inclination: (1) Biskoupsky
kopec, 380 m (Bs), (2) Drahonin, 450 m (Da), and (3) Jamolice, 365 m
above sea level (Jm). The transects were conducted along the axes of
the rectangular of elliptical areas occupied by A. thaliana plants, in
the NW-SE direction in Bs and Da, and in the N-S direction in Jm. The
samplings were done in regular distances of 4 meters. Each sample
contained 20 plants whose seeds were mixed. Eight samples were
obtained in Bs, twenty one in Da, and seven in Jm, respectively.<p>

In each sample, approximately 100 plants were studied in laboratory
examinations at 25 +/- 3*degrees*C under continuous illumination 1250
lux. The results were expressed, (i) as percent of plants appearing
flower primordia up to 28 days after emergence, g 28 (Cetl, 1978a),
and (ii) as the mean number of days to the appearance of flower
primordia, x. Regarding the summer-annual character of the populations
studied (g 28 was near to 1), the latter index was preferred to the
former.<p>

RESULTS<p>

In all three natural populations a similar tendency appeared in the
course of the transects: the mean number of days to the appearance of
flower primordia was fairly different in particular samples of the
same population and increasing in the direction of the transects, of
course, with more or less fluctuation (Figure 1, above). In the
absence of the dispersive process (and, at the same time, also of
systematic processes), homogeneity and nondirectionality of the
distribution of the mean number of days to the appearance of flower
primordia could be expected along the transects.<p>

Thus, corresponding null hypotheses relating to the homogeneity and
nondirectionality were tested. Homogeneity of the distribution of x
was not found by means of comparing the F value with the critical
value of the Fisher-Snedecor distribution:<p>

Non-directionality of the distribution of x was found by means of the
regression coefficients in the Bs and Jm population while directional
distribution of x was confirmed in the Da population (the regression
line is shown in Figure 1, above).<p>

Continuing the experiments, the mean number of days to the appearance
of flower primordia at 25+3*degrees*C and under continuous
illumination of 1250 lux was determined also in a random sample of
daughter lines derived from individual mother plants studied in the
first part. The mean number of mother plants and of their daughter
lines per sample was about 8.<p>

Two characteristics were possible to be determined:<p>

1. The estimates of the coefficients of heritability in the number of
days to the appearance of flower primordia, and 2. the estimates of
the proportion of heterozygotes for flowering-time genes among the
mother plants.<p>

Using h 2= b OP (Dobrovolna, 1968, 1969a,b; Cetl, Dobrovolna and
Effmertova, 1969; Cetl, Manouskova and Relichova, 1973; Cetl, 1976),
high statistically significant values of b OP corresponding to our
former estimates for variable populations were obtained:<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol20/vol20-pg66-tab1.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

Estimating the proportion of heterozygotes for flowering time genes
among the mother plants of particular daughter lines, h, the method
given by Cetl, Dobrovolna and Effmertova (1969) and Cetl (1976) was
precised. The variances of x within particular daughter lines were
compared with that of a tester line (Da 5-13; x +/- s.e. = 12.50 +/-
.29 days 2 = 1 day and the corresponding coefficient of variation v =
8 percent) by means of F-testing, h b, and including also the daughter
lines with g 28 <1, h b (Cetl, 1978a). The percent of heterozygotes in
the populations studied was high and comparable with that obtained by
Cetl, Dobrovolna and Effmertova (1969) and Cetl (1976).<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol20/vol20-pg66-tab2.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

By means of the latter characteristic it was possible to show that the
percent of heterozygotes for flowering time genes was also fairly
different in the course of the transects in all three natural
populations studied but without any common tendency, rather increasing
in Bs, rather decreasing in Jm and suggesting a cenral maximum in Da,
respectively (Figure 1, below).<p>

Then the null hypotheses relating to the homogeneity and
nondirectionality of the distribution of heterozygotes for flowering
time genes along the transects could be tested as above.<p>

In Bs and Da, homogeneity of the distribution of h was found by means
of comparing the X 2 (n-1) values with the critical value of X 2
.05(n-1) while in Jm, the two values were not very different
testifying to a rather weak nonhomogeneity:<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol20/vol20-pg67-tab1.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

Nondirectionality of the distribution of h was proved by means of
statistically not significant regression coefficients even if
contradictory tendencies appeared in Bs and Jm:<p>

CONCLUSION<p>

The non-homogeneity of the distribution of the mean number of days to
the appearance of flower primordia along the transects found in all
populations studied suggests that the dispersive process plays a
significant role in the internal differentiation of natural
populations. This role may be connected with the origin of
populations; they could arise from a small number of founders carrying
different sets of flowering-time genes.<p>

At the same time, this nonhomogeneity may reflect also systematic
processes and, above all, selection. In spite of an apparent
environmental homogeneity of all three biotopes, they could represent,
in fact, a mosaic of various microenvironments even if such a fine
differentiation of biotopes was not studied. In the first place, some
differences in soul moisture may be suspected. It is suggested in the
paper of Paponova (1977, p 68) that in the seasons with favourable
hydrothermal coefficients, "ephermeral forms passing the winter season
are also found in the population". Then the nonhomogenous distribution
of the flowering-time genes within the populations may result from the
process of adaptation of different genotypes to such an environmental
mosaic.<p>

The directionality of the distribution of the mean number of days to
the appearance of flower primordia along the transect found in the Da
population and a similar even if statistically not significant
tendency shown in the Bs and Jm population (with a low number of the
members of transects) seems to testify to rather nonrandom causes of
the distribution. Thus an exclusive effect of the dispersive process
on the distribution of flowering time genes within the populations
seems to be improbable. It is to note that the mean number of days to
the appearance of flower primordia tends to increase in the same NW-SE
or S-D direction.<p>

It is difficult to speculate about the mechanisms involved. An
adaptive character of the directionality cannot be excluded. Owing to
the considerable migrating or colonizing activity of A. thaliana one
may imagine that the directionality of the distribution of flowering
time genes within the populations may be connected, in some, way, with
a corresponding NW-SE direction of the genoclinal distribution of
flowering time genes in the territory of Moravia (Cetl, Dobrovolna and
Effmertova, 1969; Cetl, 19765, 1978a) and with a permanent gene flow
within the territory.<p>

The results of testing homogeneity and nondirectionality in the
distribution of the proportion of hetrozygotes for flowering time
genes along the transects show another image.<p>

In spite of some doubts as to the Jm population, in general tendency
to the homogeneity of the distribution of heterozygotes seems to be
proved, and the role of the dispersive process may be excluded. At the
same time, no role may be ascribed to systematic processes in the
distributions. The nondirectionality of the distribution of
hetereozygotes may be interpreted in a similar way.<p>

It cannot be, however, concealed that the statistical methods used in
testing homogeneity of the distribution of the mean number of days to
the appearance of flower primordia on one hand and of the proportion
of heterozygotes for flowering time genes on the other were very
different in many instances. The difficulty may be overcome using
intermediate ("mixed") natural populations which would enable us to
determine both the flowering time and the proportion of heterozygotes
as alternatively distributed characters.<p>

The two facts seem to suggest that a relatively stable proportion of
heterozygotes for flowering time genes is maintained in natural
populations by means of balancing forces (cf. Cetl, 1976)
independently of various random and nonrandom effects. The relations
between variation and stability, between role of the dispersive
process and of systematic processes, between the effects of random and
nonrandom forces should be studied intensively in natural populations
of A. thaliana.<p>
