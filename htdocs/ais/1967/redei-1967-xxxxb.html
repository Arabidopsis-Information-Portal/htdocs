	With Dr. HIRONO we reported a paper chromatographic technique for the separation of chlorophylls.  Far better separation in shorter time (10 min) can be obtained on 20 x 20 thin layer plates (MN 300 cellulose powder, 0.25 mm deep layer, solvent petrolether:  acetone 10:1, development in refrigerator).  There is practically no tailing.  Extremely small amounts are detectable with the use of an ultraviolet mineralamp UVS-12.<p>
