<h2>Pollen tube growth in intra- and interspecific combinations</h2><p>

	In order to clarify the genetic affinity between Arabidopsis thaliana and related species, several cross-pollinations were tested.  Except the confirmation of LAIBACH's results on hybridization between Cardaminopsis suicica x Arabidopsis thaliana (LAIBACH, 1958) until now seed set was only gained in the interspecific combination Arabidopsis pumila x A. thaliana. Therefore the question arose, whether some definite factors hold responsible for this defective fertilization or embryogenesis.  Primarily the pollen tube growth has been tested in a few crossing combinations.<p>

	Material:  The four species Arabidopsis thaliana (En), Arabidopsis pumila (A2), CArdamine hirsuta (C45) and Sisymbrium officinale (S132) were used.  The plants were cultivated in the green-house from September to December with an additional illumination during 18 hours.<p>

	Methods:  Flowers were pollinated two days after emasculation.  From 10 to 500 min after pollination the pollen tube growth was examined periodically in unfixed preparations of pistils.  Sections were placed on slides into a fluorescence dye and immediately afterwards observed by a fluorescence microscope. The dye specifically stains callose in plant tissues.  As pollen tubes contain callose the "fluorochrome" contrasts them from the rest of the tisues by a characteristic yellow-green fluorescence (LINSKENS, 1957).  The dye was isolated chromatographically from waterblue ("Wasserblau": MERCK No. 1279) (ARNOLD, 1956).<p>

	Preparation of the fluorochrome:  A 7% solution of waterblue is heated up to boiling.  Then a 10 mol KOH is added dropwise until the colour changes and a brown-red precipitate arises.  The clear brown-red supernatant is passed through a cellulose-column and the chromatograph developed by water.  The dye then separates into 7 components which can be sampled successively.  The first fraction can be sold as ink (high quality)!  The fluorochrome is gained from the 4. and 5. zone.  It is ready for use without further preparation and can be stored for a long time without any loss of fluorescence.  This fluorescence appears after irradiation with UV-light (OSRAM HBO 200, filter:  SCHOTT OG4 + GG4).<p>

	The cellulose-column can be used for the preparation of the dye several times.<p>

	Results:  By this method the pollen tube growth of the following cross-combinations was tested:<p>

	Pollen grains just released from the anther do not fluoresce.  But just before germination a yellow-green fluorescent region is discerned, at which the pollen tube appears.  The tubes penetrate into the stigma and grow through the conductive tissues of the style and the septum.  Not earlier than the first pollen tubes reach the basis of the silique, the tubes enter the cavity of the ovary.  They grow towards the ovules and arrive at the micropyle along the funiculus; i.e., the fertilization is porogamous (Figure 1).<p>

	Figure 2 shows the development of pollen tubes per unit time in the tested combinations.  The estimates are only qualitative.  They are classified into the following categories.<p>

	0 Pollen grains not yet germinated<p>

	1 Beginning of germination (fluorescent region!) up to appearance of pollen tubes<p>

	2 Tubes arrived at the basis of the stigma papillae<p>

	3 Tubes penetrating the conductive tissue<p>

	4 Tubes passed through the style<p>

	5 Tubes passed through half of the septum<p>

	6 Tubes arrived at the basis of the silique<p>

	7 Tubes enter the micropyle of 50% of the ovules<p>

	8 All ovules fertilized<p>

	In case of the intraspecific combinations A2 x A2 and En x En the pollen germinated 10 min after pollination.  In En x En the tubes entered the micropyles already after 160 min.  Meanwhile in A2 x A2 the tubes only passed through half of the septum; they arrived at the micropyles 500 min after pollination.  Surely this difference in growth rate is not a constant characteristic of the two species, because it largely depends on environmental conditions and the physiological state of the plant.<p>

	Within the three tested interspecific combinations the pollen tube growth differs obviously.  No inhibition of growth could be recognized, when A. pumila was pollinated with A. thaliana.  The tubes passed through the style and the septum in the same time interval as pollen tubes of their own species.  There seemed to be only a little retardation of growth, when the tubes arrived at the ovules and tried to pass through the micropyle.  The seed set after this hybridization is about 45%. - The combination C45 x En represents a lower degree of compatibility.  Though the pollen tubes reach the ovules their growth is inhibited during two stages: 1) at the penetration into the stigmatic tissue and 2) during their chemotropic orientation in the cavity of the ovary, which seemed to be disturbed.  In the region of the micropyle sometimes the ends of the tubes were seen to be thickened and numerous windings were recognized.  This combination failed to set seeds. - In the combination S 132 x En the tubes apparently were unable to dissolve the cuticula of the stigma papillae.  Therefore similar thickenings and bendings appeared as in the forementioned case, but already at this early stage.<p>
