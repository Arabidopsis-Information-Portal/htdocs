Postdoctoral Position  
University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee
 
A full-time postdoctoral position supported by the NSF is available in the laboratory of 
Dr. Dazhong Zhao at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. The successful candidate will 
study the signaling mechanism underlying cell fate determination during Arabidopsis 
flower development. The successful candidate will employ molecular genetic, 
biochemical, cell biological and proteomic approaches to identify signaling molecules 
and their interactions in a receptor kinase-linked signal transduction pathway. Applicants 
should be highly motivated, independent, and collaborative. Experience in mutant 
identification and/or protein-protein interaction characterization is a plus, but not 
required.  This position can be extended for up to three years.  
 
All qualified candidates are encouraged to apply. Please email a cover letter, CV, and 
contact information for three references to Dazhong Dave Zhao (dzhao@uwm.edu). 
Review of applications will begin immediately, and will continue until the position is 
filled.
 
The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee is an AA/EEO employer. UWM is a large 
research oriented institution located on the north side of Milwaukee. The university is 
only five blocks from Lake Michigan. Milwaukee is an affordable city, and a great place 
to live.
