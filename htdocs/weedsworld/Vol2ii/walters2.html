Evidence is growing that that variations in chloroplast 
composition in response to environmental change depend on 
signals from photosynthetic metabolism such the levels of ATP 
and NADPH in the stroma and/or cytoplasm, or the redox state 
of components of the photosynthetic apparatus (e.g. 
plastoquinone), but the nature of such signals remains unknown 
(Melis <I>et al.</I> 1985; Chow <I>et al.</I> 1990a; Maxwell <I>et al.</I> 1994, 
1995).  Based on experiments in which the spectral quality of 
growth lights have been manipulated so as to preferentially 
excite either PSI or PSII, it has been suggested that 
photosystem stoichiometry is regulated by the redox state of 
electron transport components between the two photosystems, a 
signal known to be important in cyanobacteria (Fujita <I>et al.</I> 
1987); an imbalance between the two in the rates of excitation 
would thus generate a signal which feeds back, leading to the 
correction of that imbalance (Kim <I>et al.</I> 1993). <P>

Contrary to this hypothesis, work by ourselves and Chow <I>et al.</I> 
(1990b) has showed that growth with and without high levels of 
supplementary far-red light does not lead to changes in 
photosystem stoichiometry, despite the marked effect on the 
redox state of the electron transport chain.  Furthermore, 
Arabidopsis grown in red light enriched in far-red and 
depleted in blue wavelengths (preferentially absorbed by PSI) 
has a PSII/PSI ratio similar to that of white light-grown 
plants.  These data indicate that photosystem levels are not 
regulated by metabolic control alone.  Supplementing red 
growth lights with low irradiance blue light had a marked 
effect on PSII levels, suggesting a direct role for blue light 
in the regulation of photosystem stoichiometry.  Assaying PSII
in plants grown in background red illumination 
with varying irradiances of supplementary blue light did not 
reveal a correlation between blue irradiance and PSII content.    <P>

However, further analysis of the data suggests that both red 
and blue have a regulatory role.  The figure shows data for 
PSII content plotted as a function of the blue irradiance 
relative to that of the background red light, together with 
PSI and PSII levels for plants grown under other light 
regimes.  A relationship between the spectral characteristics 
of the growth light regime and photosystem stoichiometry is 
now apparent:  the presence of very low supplementary blue 
light leads to a 50% increase in the level of PSII per unit 
Chl; as blue light increases further relative to the 
background red light, PSII content falls again, eventually 
returning to the level observed in plants grown in red light 
alone.  The relatively minor changes in PSI levels which are 
observed as the proportion of blue light increases mirror the 
changes in PSII.  <P>

Such two-phase responses to blue light have previously been 
observed in pea seedlings, for epicotyl elongation and Lhcb 
mRNA levels (Warpeha <I>et al.</I> 1989; Warpeha and Kaufman 1990a, 
1990b; Marrs and Kaufman 1991), and have been interpreted as 
indicating the involvement of two separate blue light 
responses:  low-fluence-responses which inhibited epicotyl 
elongation and stimulated mRNA accumulation; and high-fluence 
responses which had the reverse effects.  These observations 
are highly reminiscent of the response of PSII levels to blue 
light, and we suggest that two blue light reponses are 
involved in the regulation of photosystem stoichiometry: an 
inductive low-fluence-response, which activates acclimation; 
and a regulatory high-fluence response which is attenuated by 
red light.  We interpret this effect of red light as being 
consistent with existing hypotheses that chloroplast 
composition is regulated by photosynthetic metabolism.  The 
behaviour of a hy4 mutant, which exhibits altered acclimation 
behaviour (see Figure), supports this hypothesis; the hy4 
mutation affects the inhibition of hypocotyl elongation, a 
blue high-fluence-response (Ahmad and Cashmore 1993). <P>
