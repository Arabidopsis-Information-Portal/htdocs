AIS Vol 02:<h2>A survey on agents tested with regard to their ability to induce recessive lethals in Arabidopsis</h2><p>

(Institute of Crop Plants Research, Gatersleben, Bez. Halle/Sa.,
Germany)<p>

The following survey deals with results of experiments carried out at
the Institut fur Kulturpflanzenforschung, Gatersleben.  Recessive
lethals (embryonic lethal mutations and lethal chlorophyll mutations)
identifiable by the embryo test (cf. MULLER 1963, 1964a) were used as
indicator of mutagenic effectivity of the agents.  For all tested
agents only the highest concentration allowing an evaluation of
M2-progenies is given.  Besides this concentration (aqueous solution)
duration of treatment and treatment temperature are specified.
Treated were either dry seeds (dS), presoaked seeds (pS) or
germinating seeds and seedlings (G).  Symbol r means reduction of root
length in percent (cf. MULLER 1964a, b).  Lm means average number of
recessive lethals mutations per treated germ line cell. ("-"
symbolizes that the mutation frequency after treatment was not
significantly higher than the spontaneous mutation frequency.)<p>
