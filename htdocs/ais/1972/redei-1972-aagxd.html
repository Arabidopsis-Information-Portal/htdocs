<h2> Compatability of Arabidopsis thaliana with Cardaminopsis arenosa</h2><p>

On the basis of morpholigical evidence and chromosome counts HYLANDER
(1957) suggested that Cardaminopsis suecica (Fr.) Hiit (2n = 26) may
be an amphiploid of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. (24 = 10) and
Cardaminopsis arenosa (L.) Hayek (2n = 32).  LOVE, reexamining the
case, proposed that Cardaminopsis suecica should be renamed as
Hylandra suecica (Fr.) LOVE and thus created a monotypic genus.<p>

The origin of Hylandra according to the HYLANDER-LOVE hypothesis
appears logical since a cross between a tetraploid Arabidopsis and
Cardaminopsis or if an occasional unreduced gamete of the diploid
Arabidopsis is combined with the diploid gemete of Cardaminopsis
arenosa a hybrid of the expected chromosome number may result.<p>

Unfortunately direct proof for this phylogenetic hypothesis has not
been produced during the 15 years elapsed since its inception.  On the
contrary LAIBACH (1958) who reported the first successful hybrids of
Arabidopsis Cardaminopsis suecica with A. thaliana and with
Cardaminopsis arenosa stated that "eine Kreuzung zwischen C. arenosa
and A. thaliana nach unseren bisherigen Erfahrungen nicht moglich
ist".  Similarly MESICEK (1967) failed to obtain C. arenosa and A.
thaliana hybrids though he made a successful cross between A. thaliana
(2n = 10) and Cardaminopsis petraea (L.) Hiit. (2n = 16).  BERGER
(1968) demonstrated that fertilization may take place between C.
arenosa and A. thaliana though she apparently failed to obtain hybrid
plants from such a cross.<p>

Recently we pollinated C. arenosa (obtained from Dr. G. ROBBELEN) with
tetraploid A. thaliana and viable seed was obtained in the reciprocal
crosses. This information provides direct support to the HYLANDER-LOVE
hypothesis.  It may be noted furthermore that under laboratory
conditions we found both autotetraploid and autohexaploid forms of
Arabidopsis without any specific treatment.  Thus polyploidization may
take place in nature thus providing an appropriate source of gametes.
The spontaneous hybridization may be facilitated by the fact that C.
arenosa, a species with fragrant flowers requires artificial (self-)
pollination for seed production in the greenhouse and it is probably
insect pollinated in nature.<p>
