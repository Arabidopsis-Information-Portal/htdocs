	It is known that in Arabidopsis the developmental characters are the most variable ones.  NAPP-ZINN (1964) has shown that there may be considerable variation not only among different populations and different plants within a population but also in the progenies of individual plants.  In our experiments it has been found that a high variability exists both between and within populations, which appears to be distributed into determinable categories (CETL, 1965).  In this communication the variability within progenies of individual plants is presented in addition to the earlier data.<p>

	The experiments were carried out on five populations, two of which were "summer annual" (Kr-4, Pi) and three "mixed" (Bo-l, Dou, He-2) (Cf. CTL, 1965, pp 47-48).  The seed was sown in the experimental garden of the Department on May 3, 1965.  Under these conditions an elimination of late types, especially in the "mixed" populations, and also a possibility of crossing were not excluded.<p>

	The progenies of all harvested plants were grown at 25+ 3*degrees*C under continuous illumination (1250 lux) for 42 days.  In this case the variability within progenies in the number of days to appearance of the flower primordia (x) and in the number of rosette leaves (y) was expressed in terms of the variation coefficients (v) as these are practically Independent of the absolute values.  At the same time v values of four homozygous races (S-96, Di, Li-5, and H-55) were calculated for comparison (see table).<p>

	It is surprising that a great majority of progenies shows a higher variation in x as well as in y than the homozygous races.  If the value v = 10.0% in both characters is conventionally chosen as a limit between the homozygotes and heterozygotes then in the material presented here only 25.6 and 36.4% progenies appear to be homozygous in the two characters.  As it can be seen from unpublished data referring to A3 lines obtained from similar natural populations, the percentage of homozygous progenies can be increased by means of a reapeated autogamization in the two characters to 43.3 and 57.4%<p>

	These results confirm in agreement with the data presented by napp-ZINN (1964) that in natural populations of Arabidopsis there is an apparent heterozygosity at least in the characters studied.  This heterozygosity in such an autogamous plant, its origin and causes, must be examined by special methods.<p>
