The use of cell suspension cultures in the isolation of mutants
usually involves plating of cells on solid substrate and subsequent
culture of these cells to cell colonies under selective conditions.<p>

The most common method of plating cells is mixing the cells with an
appropriate volume of liquefied agar containing medium (soft agar) and
pouring out this mixture onto a solid medium. Often, plating
efficiency is rather low because of failure of cells to divide after
plating. Modifications of the plating techniques with soft agar like
use of feeder cells (Weber and Lark, 1979) have increased the plating
efficiency in some cases. Problems with plating efficiency are
especially large when the cell line used is growing rather poorly, as
can be when mutant lines are involved.<p>

In order to be able to select for mutants, we developed a method for
plating Arabidopsis cells after mutagenic treatment which gives good
results, also with poorly growing cultures.<p>

The lines used in the experiments were A. thaliana Heynh. ecotype
"Landsberg" and a mutant strain B25 (Oostindier-Braaksma and Feenstra,
1974). The medium used (PG2) was essentially as described by Negrutiu
et al. (1975). Cell cultures were induced from pieces of leaves.
Subculture of the callus was done every four weeks. Liquid cultures
were subcultured every two weeks. Before plating cell suspensions were
sieved through a nylon sieve with a pore size of 210 micro m.<p>

In the cell suspensions most living cells were present in clusters of
different size. Almost all single cells showed an increase in cell
volume and appeared to have lost their ability to divide. Cell
cultures of wild type and B25 showed after sieving a majority of
single cells and small clusters of 5-50 cells. When l ml of these
sieved suspensions (containing, besides single cells, 3,000-5,000
small clusters per ml) was mixed with 9 ml soft agar (0.3% agar in
PG2) and plated on solid PG2 (0.7% agar) no or only a few colonies
were formed. In Figure 1E a representative plate is shown with absence
of colonies after plating and culturing 1 ml B25 for 1 month.
Concentration of suspensions of sieved cells by centrifugation at low
speed caused no increase in plating efficiency. Concentration of cells
by filtration of 5 ml of sieved cell suspensions on filters followed
by washing three times with liquid PG2 and culturing the filters with
the retained cells on solid meidum resulted in a remarkable increase
of the number of colonies (Figure 1A to D). As can be seen from Figure
1A, B both Millipore and normal filter paper gave good results. Use of
a layer of fast growing, UV-radiated cells as feeder cells had only a
negative effect (Figure 1C, D).<p>

Studies on the retained cells after filtration over paper filters
showed a complete loss of single cells and small aggregates.
Application of a double layer of paper filters reduced the loss of the
small aggregates. When 9 cm paper filters were used, volumes up to 25
ml could be filtered without silting up of the filters. After
culturing for about 5 weeks the size of the colonies had reached its
maximum. Culturing these calli for 2 months resulted in a reduced
viability, but induction of new divisions on fresh medium was still
possible after a period of 8 months.<p>

There are several explanations for the observed improvement in colony
forming ability. By filtration of larger volumes of sieved cell
suspensions the concentration of cells might have reached a critical
density for induction of the first divisions. The washing procedure
can remove toxic components thus improving the environmental
conditions. Perhaps the fluid in the filters facilitates a better
transport of feeding substances and waste products. Next to these
factors a better gas exchange between cells and the air may have
influenced the plating efficiency.<p>

From the results obtained it can be concluded that plating of A.
thaliana cells is not necessarily restricted to some genotypes
selected for good growth but can also be carried out with poorly
growing genotypes. Filters with immobilized cells may also prove
useful when it is necessary to expose growing colonies to different
media, e.g. when it is required to transfer the colonies from
nonselective to selective conditions.<p>
