Postdoctoral position in plant development 
  The Laboratory of Dr. Pilar Cubas, in the Department of Plant 
  Molecular Genetics at the Centro Nacional de Biotecnología (CNB) 
  offers a 3 year postdoctoral position. Starting date April-June 2009. 
  We are studying the genetic control of shoot branching, a major 
  determinant of plant architecture. We have characterized BRANCHED1 
  (BRC1), an Arabidopsis TCP gene that controls this decision acting 
  inside the axillary buds. We have also shown that BRC1 integrates the 
  response to environmental and developmental signals controlling 
  branching (Aguilar-Martínez et al. 2007, Plant Cell 19: 458-472). 
  The postdoc will work in one of the following topics: 
  1. BRC1 transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational 
  regulation 
  2. Identification and characterization of BRC1 target genes 
  3. Role of TCP transcription factors in plant growth and development 
  Applicants with a Ph.D. in Genetics, Biochemistry or Molecular 
  Biology, publications in international journals and a strong 
  background in molecular biology, developmental biology or plant 
  genetics are encouraged to apply. Please send CV, brief description of 
  previous research and names of three references to: Pilar Cubas, 
  Department of Plant Molecular Genetics, Centro Nacional de 
  Biotecnología. E-mail: pcubas@cnb.csic.es
