Postdoctoral Fellow Position in Plant Epigenetics and Development

National University of Singapore and Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory

A postdoctoral fellow is sought to study molecular and epi-genetic
mechanisms underlying the floral transition in Arabidopsis, in the lab of
Dr. Yuehui He at the National University of Singapore and the Temasek Life
Sciences Laboratory, Singapore. The successful candidate will investigate
how the expression of regulatory genes controlling the timing of floral
transition is regulated by various chromatin modifications in the model
plant Arabidopsis, using biochemical, genetic and molecular tools. We are
looking for a highly motivated individual with biochemical and molecular
genetic training. The candidate should have first-authored publications in
internationally-referred journals. Competitive salary and benefits will be
offered based on the candidate's experience. Singapore is known as the
'Garden City', and the city country has gained recognition for its dynamic
life-science research environment.
