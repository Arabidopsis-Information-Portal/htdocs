A postdoctoral position is available in UCDavis starting on or after May 
1st, 2008, to study mechanism and significance of protein maturation and 
targeting in the biogenesis of photosynthetic compartments in higher 
plants. 
 
A number of proteins involved in photosynthetic light reaction are 
targeted to thylakoid lumen with signal peptides that are cleaved by 
thylakoidal processing peptidase (TPP). There are at least three TPP 
homologs in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Recently, we took a 
genetic approach to show that one of them called Plsp1 is essential for 
proper thylakoid development (J Cell Biol '05 171, 425-430). 
Interestingly, Plsp1 is located in both thylakoids and the envelope of 
the organelle, whereas other two TPP homologs appear to exist only in 
thylakoids. The successful candidate for this position is expected to 
use the reagents generated in the previous study and also to develop new 
tools to address the significance of gene duplication giving rise to 
multiple TPPs, and/or the mechanism of intraorganellar protein sorting. 
 
A strong background in molecular biology and biochemistry is required. 
Experience of molecular cloning, over-expression of a gene of interest 
in bacteria and/or other organisms, and genetic analysis of model 
organisms is also desirable. The initial appointment is for 1-2 years 
and its renewal is highly possible, depending on the performance of the 
individual. 
 
To apply, please send a full C.V. including a brief description of 
research experience and interests, and names/email addresses of three 
references via email to:
