Bioinformatics Postdoctoral Position
Institute of Biochemistry and Biology, University of Potsdam, Germany

A core-funded postdoctoral position for a bioinformatician is available in the group of Michael 
Lenhard at the Institute of Biochemistry and Biology, University of Potsdam, Germany, with a starting 
date after April 2011.

Work in the Lenhard group focuses on understanding the genetic control and evolutionary modification 
of organ size in plants. A range of genetic and genomic approaches are used in various models, such 
as Arabidopsis, Capsella and barley.

The successful candidate holds a PhD in Bioinformatics or Genetics and should have previous research 
experience in analysing data from microarrays, high-throughput genotyping or next-generation 
sequencing, as documented by relevant publications. Good written and oral communication skills are 
essential, as is the ability to work both independently and in a team. The working language of the 
laboratory is English.

The position is offered according to German payscale TV-L E13 (approx. E 27K net pay p.a.), initially 
for three years, with a possible extension by another three years. The University of Potsdam is an 
equal-opportunity employer and encourages applications by qualified women and disabled persons.

For previous work by the Lenhard group, see Eriksson et al. (2010), Curr Biol 20: 527-32; Anastasiou 
et al. (2007), Dev Cell 13: 843-56; Disch et al. (2006), Curr Biol 16: 272-9.

Please send applications including Curriculum Vitae, a letter of motivation and contact information 
for two referees to Michael Lenhard (michael.lenhard@uni-potsdam.de). Applications will be considered 
until the position is filled.
