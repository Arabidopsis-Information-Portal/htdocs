Lignocellulosic materials produced by biomass grasses are a promising feedstock to 
produce low-cost ethanol. Genetic improvement of grasses through genetic engineering 
or targeted mutagenesis will enhance their quality and reduce costs associated with 
biomass conversion to fuel. A description of our research objectives to develop 
genetically enhanced grasses can be found at: 
http://www.mae.ufl.edu/Energy/index.php?src=faculty&ID=79. Efficient nuclear grass 
transformation or mutagenesis protocols are established in our laboratory.


Job Description: Selected candidates will focus on RNAi suppression of rate limiting 
genes in the lignin biosynthetic pathway or high level expression of cell wall degrading 
enzymes to enhance biomass quality and quantity. This will include gene cloning, tissue 
culture, gene transfer, molecular and biochemical characterization of improved grasses.

Qualifications: The successful applicants must have a first-class Master's or BS degree in 
Molecular Biology, Biotechnology, Biochemistry, Plant Science or Microbiology. The 
successful Ph.D candidates will have demonstrated experience in standard molecular 
biology techniques and plant transformation and a demonstrated ability to perform 
research at an advanced level. Superior communication skills and the ability to work both 
independently and in a team are essential.



Stipend: Stipend is commensurate with training and experience and will include tuition 
and a contribution to health insurance.



To Apply: You will find information on how to apply at 
http://agronomy.ifas.ufl.edu/gradadmission.html. Send also a cover letter describing your 
research interests and career goals, CV, transcripts, and the contact information for three 
references preferably by e-mail to 
faltpeter@ifas.ufl.edu<mailto:faltpeter@mail.ifas.ufl.edu> or addressed to: Dr. Fredy 
Altpeter, Agronomy Department, University of Florida, IFAS, PO Box 11O300, 
Gainesville, FL 32611-300. Review of applications will start immediately and continue 
until suitable candidates are identified. Research may potentially start as early as 
September 2008 but applicants must apply for a January 2009 start date in the Ph.D. or 
Masters program.
