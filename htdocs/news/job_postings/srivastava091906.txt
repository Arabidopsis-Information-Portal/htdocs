A Postdoctoral Associate position is available at University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR to 
study epigenetic mechanisms in Arabidopsis.  See the position announcement in the following link:

http://hr.uark.edu/Employment/listingsjob.asp?ListingID=4184

The project "Unraveling Epigenetic Mechanisms of Gene Expression for Agricultural and Medical 
Applications" consists of two parts: (1) Expression-Threshold of a Foreign Gene in Rice Cells; 
(2) Mechanism of Transcriptional Silencing of Arabidopsis Phytochrome A (PHYA) Gene.  
Thus experience in Chromatin analysis, RNA analysis, Vector construction, and Transgenic plant 
analysis is desirable for this project. PhD in plant molecular biology or related field is required.  
Please send Vibha Srivastava (vibhas@uark.edu) resume and names of 2 referees to be considered for the job.
