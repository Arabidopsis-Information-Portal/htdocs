PhD position in plant biochemistry 
Title: Visualization of receptor activation in plants 

Plants possess cell surface receptors to respond to extracellular signals like hormones or pathogens. 
Activation of these signaling pathways comprises binding of ligands to the extracellular domain of a 
receptor protein followed by changes in the phosphorylation status of the intracellular kinase domain 
of the receptor. Phosphorylation of receptor kinases (RKs) is the key step in activation of these 
signaling processes This project aims to develop a fluorescence-based biosensor enabling to elucidate 
timing, localization and dynamics of active receptors in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. 

Visualization of signaling events has received very little attention so far, mainly due to technical 
limitations. In this project modern fluorescence spectroscopy technology is combined with an 
interesting biological problem to unravel signaling events in a whole organism. 

We are looking for a motivated candidate preferably in the field of (plant) cell biology/biochemsitry. 
Applicants should hold a MSc degree in biochemistry or cell biology with special interest in 
fluorescence spectroscopy. 

The work will be performed in the Laboratory of Biochemistry http://www.bic.wur.nl/UK/Research/Biomolecular+Networks
and Microspectroscopy Centre (MSC) of Wageningen University. The laboratory of Biochemistry has 
substantial experience in RLK signaling in plants and is well accommodated for biochemical and genetic 
analysis of these processes. The MSC is an excellent facility for optical (micro-) spectroscopic 
analysis as required for this project.
 
The position is available immediately and applicants will be accepted until the position has been filled.
