In recent years the AIS-seed bank of Arabidopsis thaliana has been
increasingly used for studies in ecology, physiology, developmental
and molecular genetics as well as radiation biology, because this
eukaryotic plant has the shortest life cycle, secure self-pollination,
abundant seed production, and is easy to cultivate under normal glass
house as well as aseptic laboratory conditions. Additional advantages
given below, presently make this nicknamed "botanical Drosophila" an
effective tool for studying up to date research problems of modern
genetics and gene technology (Redei, 1975; Kranz, 1984; Meyerowitz and
Pruitt, 1985):<p>

a) extremely small nuclear volume, and low DNA content per cell (30
micro m 3, 0.2 pg, 2 x 10 8 bp)<p>

b) very small chromosome volume of 2 micro m 3 approx.<p>

c) low number and size of repetitive DNA sequences per genome (18 x 10
3 kbp, average size of single copy sequences 120 kbp)<p>

d) low chromosome number (2n = 10), and number of linkage groups (5)
with stable auto tetraploids and primary trisomics<p>

e) low sensitivity of resting somatic cells for radio mutatagens (500
mM for EMS and 10 E-4 M for nucleic acid analogues)<p>

f) low number of genetically effective cells in the somatic embryo (2
per dry seed)<p>

g) stable marker lines representative for each linkage group and main
chromosome position<p>

h) large number of wild ecotypes and induced mutant lines conserved in
seed banks<p>

Such accumulated advantages can rarely be found in other species and
make Arabidopsis thaliana (L) Heynh. the most successful eukaryotic
plant test system of molecular and space biology.<p>

For that reason, during the last decade an increasing amount of
requests and orders for seed material was sent to the secretary of
AIS-seed bank at Frankfort (FRG), and it is expected that the interest
in this plant material will grow insignificantly in the near future.
Therefore, an easier managed and more economic organization of this
seed bank is needed.<p>

Since the first and continuing lists of AIS-seed bank have been
published (Kranz, 1978; Kirchheim and Kranz, 1981), in the meantime
additional wild type population samples, mutant lines and marker lines
were enclosed as well as the computerized listing was improved. In
order to facilitate the handling of lists and the control of
information, all the data available at present were stored on computer
files by usage of the EDISS software program. The format of the data
files was defined so that it adapts for the following: name,
phenotype/genotype, origin, and source; additionally, the format fits
for control of the sample amount, character description, references,
and receivers. Last not least the data processing allows to compile
the information in short time at low costs for the AIS secretary as
well as for the users interested in definite material. For saving of
expense, the single amount of material to be mailed at prime costs is
restricted to 100 seeds per sample line.<p>

Beginners in Arabidopsis research should follow the suggestions below
in order to make their request to AIS secretary most effective:<p>

1) survey the material of AIS-seed bank by use of the abstract
listings of wildtype population and mutant lines (Table 1)<p>

2) inform rsp. make use of the suggestions for successful culture
(Table 2).<p>

3) use the request rsp. order form of AIS-seed bank and fill in the
blanks designations etc. (last page of this volume) of the material
requested.<p>

Complete and actual listing is mailed by inquiry.<p>

The aim of this short communication is to improve the information on
the increasing amount of material conserved in the AIS-seed bank at
Frankfort (FRG). Furthermore, the purpose of the earlier presentations
sustain (Kranz, pg 119, 1978) as follows:<p>

Table 1b: Abstract of AIS Mutant Lines<p>

i) to inform everybody interested in this subject on its enormous
variability<p>

ii) to enable researchers to select material suited for their
experiments<p>

iii) to eliminate misdesignations by uniform and handsome
classification of seed samples, and<p>

iv) to stimulate the conservation of wild races of those regions of
the northern hemisphere not be considered as well as to increase the
activity for screening unusual, new mutant types.<p>

In this way, it is hoped that the interest in the experimental utilty
of Arabidopsis is promoted and the genetic stock exchange of this
excellent organism will be extended.<p>
