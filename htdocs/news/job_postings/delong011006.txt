POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH POSITION
REGULATION OF PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2A ACTIVITY

A postdoctoral position is available for a period of up to three years to study the regulation of 
Arabidopsis protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) by its scaffolding/regulatory A subunits.  PP2A is an 
abundant heterotrimeric serine/threonine protein phosphatase with broad substrate specificity and a 
diverse repertoire of cellular functions.  The RCN1 gene and its paralogs PP2AA2 and PP2AA3 encode 
the three regulatory A subunits, and loss of RCN1 function leads to reduced PP2A activity, alterations 
in polar auxin transport and pleiotropic effects on plant growth.  Mutations in PP2AA2 and PP2AA3 have 
little effect on overall PP2A activity, but functions of the isoforms encoded by these genes are 
unmasked in the rcn1 mutant background.  Currently we are defining the molecular basis for functional 
specialization of A subunit isoforms, characterizing the composition of PP2A complexes in mutant and 
wild-type plants, and taking a phosphoproteomic approach to identification of PP2A substrates.

Candidates must have a strong background in molecular genetics and/or biochemistry.  To apply, please 
send your current CV, a letter outlining your research interests and accomplishments, and arrange to 
have three letters of reference sent directly to Prof. Alison DeLong; Dept. of Molecular Biology, 
Cell Biology and Biochemistry; Brown University; Providence RI  02912; TEL 401-863-3888; FAX 401-863-2421.
