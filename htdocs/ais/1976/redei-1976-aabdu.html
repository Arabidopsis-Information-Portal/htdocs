INTRODUCTION<p>

At the first Arabidopsis Symposium in 1965 Professor Laibach rightly
pointed out that differentiation and development of higher plants are
expected to be understood only by a direct study of plants.  The most
attractive prokaryotic experiences can be applied only with great
caution.<p>

Differentiation and development are achieved by complex processes of
metabolic regulation.  One of the most promising approaches to the
problems is to select mutants controlling sequential steps of these
events.  Occasionally, we can find some biochemical clues concerning
the mechanisms involved.  Most of the time we have to rely on isolated
pieces of evidence and it requires considerable effort to arrange
correctly even parts of the puzzle.<p>

Genetic regulation at the molecular level is best understood in
prokaryotes because of the relative simplicity of their organization.
We must keep in mind that even in this group of organisms the
situation is not quite as straightforward as we tend to visualize it
(Beckwith and Rossow 1974).<p>

In higher organisms, the molecular basis of the control is rarely
demonstrated by direct means. We hope that the material currently
available in our laboratory will facilitate a deeper undertanding of
the problem in the near future.<p>

TEMPERATURE-SENSITIVE THIAMINE MUTANTS<p>

It is unfortunate that the enzymes of the thiamine path are difficult
to handle biochemically. The genetic characterization of the mutants
involved in this pathway is much easier.<p>

We have found a large number of allelic mutants involved in the
synthesis of the pyrimidine moiety of the vitamin. Though only one
locus is represented by the mutants, complementation analysis revealed
the existance of at least 3 cistrons.  All the complementary alleles
are temperature sensitive (Li and Redei 1969a).  (See Table 1).<p>

It is interesting to note that at the same gene locus both high and
low temperature-sensitive mutants occur.<p>

The difference among these mutants is determined either by the
activation energy or the conformation is temperature dependent.<p>

GLUCOSE EFFECT IN THE THIAMINE PATH<p>

Catabolite repression or glucose effect in microorganisms interferes
with the normal synthesis of the enzymes indirectly related to the
breakdown products of certain carbohydrates. The synthesis of the
thiazole moiety of thiamine is similarly affected by glucose or by its
disaccharide, maltose; however, the pyrimidine path is insensitive to
glucose (Li and Redei 1969b).<p>

Figure 1: The thiamine biosynthetic path.<p>

The presence of glucose in the medium exacts a higher level of
thiazole or thiamine if there is a genetic defect in the lower part of
the pathway (see Figure 1).  Pyrimidine synthesis or utilization is
exempted, however, from the catabolite control.<p>

FRUCTOSE EFFECT<p>

Hereditary fructose intolerance in man is caused by a defect in
fructose-1-phosphate aldolase.  Individuals homozygous for this inborn
anomaly are poisoned by fructose to various degrees.<p>

The nutritional role of exogenously supplied fructose to plants has
been controversial until recently.  Langridge had the veiw that
Arabidopsis cannot utilize fructose even if it is supplied in sucrose.
According to our experience, fructose is an excellent carbon source
for Arabidopsis as long as it is protected from heat degradation.<p>

Chromatographic separation and identification of the decomposition
products of fructose revealed that more than a dozen different
compounds are generated in the autoclaved media.<p>

Culturing Arabidopsis or its close relatives (Hylandra, Cardaminopsis)
on very dilute concentrations of the major decomposition products
(hydroxymethyl furfural, hydroxyacetyl furan, levulinic acid) resulted
in growth inhibition and other symptoms of poisoning similar to those
oberved on autoclaved fructose.<p>

Table 4: Relative Dry Weight of Hylandra Plants on Media Containing
Breakdown Products of Frucotse.<p>

The level of ten glycolytic enzymes was studied in plants harvested
from autoclaved fructose media. Significant and consistent differences
were found only in fructose aldolase (Redei 1973a).<p>

Table 5: Relative levels of Fructose-1, 6-Diphosphate Aldolase
cleavage and condensation reactions in Cardaminopsis arenosa.
Essentially similar results were obtained with Arabidopsis and
Hylandra plants.  The level of fructose-1-phosphate aldolase showed a
similar change but the activities were too low to make accurate
measurements.<p>

Thus, fructose intolerance in man has an apparently different cause
than that in Arabidopsis and relatives. There is the somewhat
surprising similarity that aldolase production is involved in both
cases.  One may wonder whether the symptoms of fructose intolerance in
man would not be partly due to an adverse effect of fructose
decomposition products on the fructose-1, 6-diphosphate aldolase
enzyme present in persons afflicted with the disorder. Fructose can
readily break down under physiolgoical conditions, especially at
higher acidity in the human alimentary tract.<p>

AMINO ACID INTOLERANCE<p>

During the course of our recent studies, we have found that mutant
405-A-154 is extremely sensitive to amino acids.<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol13/vol13-pg113-tab6.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

Table 6: Casein Hydrolysate Intolerance of Mutant 405-A-154<p>

The mutant is insensitive to urea but several amino acids, most
notably valine and glutamic acid are very toxic.  The amino acid
sensitivity is enhanced by the presence of NO3 as the sole inorganic
N-source; NH4 mitigates the deleterious effects of amino acids.<p>

The inhibitory effect of valine is relieved by the addition of
isoleucine.  Leucine, in contrast, has an additive inhibitory effect
when supplied with valine.<p>

On NH4NO3-containing media the wild type is not much affected by
valine. But on nutrient solutions having KNO3 as the inorganic
N-source, the wild type becomes also sensitive to these amino acids
though to a lesser degree. The compensating feedback effect of
isoleucine is then manifested also in the wild type.<p>

This response of Arabidopsis to amino acids may be the cause why
obligate amino acid auxotrophs have not yet been identified in this
plant.<p>

When we fed uniformly labelled 14-C valine to the plants of both
genotypes, an increased incorporation of the amino acid could be
ascertained on KNO3 compared with NH4NO3. Thus, NH4 ions regulate
either the membrane transport or control the uptake or the
ultilization of the pool. The difference between the mutant and the
wild type is not simply a differential uptake, however.<p>

REGULATION OF PLASTID DIFFERENTIATION<p>

A large number of nonidentical alleles at the im locus facultatively
control the differentiation of the proplastids into chloroplasts
(Redei et al. 1973, Chung & Redei 1974).<p>

The genetic regulation of the im locus is complex.  A single recessive
gene in homozygous condition permits the overproduction of at least 3
enzymes involved in the synthesis or degradation of RNA.<p>

Due to the increased activity of the de novo pyrimidine synthetic
enzymes, orotidine-5'- phosphate pyrophosphorylase and orotidine-5'
-phosphate decarboxylase, the base composition in the RNA of the
mutant shifts in favor fo the pyrimidines.  Apparently, in response to
the presence of the abnormal RNA(s) in the cells, the mutant develops
an unusually high ribonuclease activity.<p>

By growing the plants on 6-azauracil media, the activities of all
three enzymes within the cell are returned to near normal level. This
is acomplished by an intricate set of events.<p>

The pyrophosphorylase levl which on minimal media was found to be
about 50-100% higher in the white tissues of the mutant than in the
wild type, becomes reduced to about half of the normal level when the
plants are grown on azauracil. The activity of the enzym is apparently
unaffected.<p>

The level of the decarboxylase in the white tissues of the mutant is
about double that of the wild type in the absence of azauracil in the
culture medium.  In contrast to the pyrophosphorylase, the level of
the decarboxylase further increases in the cells grown on azauracil
media; the enzyme may be three fold as much in the mutant as in the
normal.<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol13/vol13-pg115-fig3.gif">Click here for figure</a><p>

Figure 3: Plasrids in the white tissues of the im1 mutant (A).
Chloroplasts inthe im1 homozygotes developed under the conditions of
1.6 x 10E-5 M 6-azauracil feeding (B).  The magnification of figure A is
almost three fold that of B.<p>

In the plant cells--unlike in animal tissues--azauracil is readily
converted to azauridine-5' -phosphate. This latter compound when
present in the enzyme assay medium at concentrations of 10E-5 to
1-E-4M inhibits very strongly the activity of the decarboxylase.
Consequently, the conversion of orotic acid into uridine is reduced to
about 20% that of the control.  In the acid-insoluble fractions, the
radioactivity contributed by the 6 position carbon atom of orotic acid
was diminished to about 10% of the control value.<p>

Since the synthesis of the decarboxylase is under feedback control, in
case of a paucity of the enzyme products, its level can reach high
values.<p>

In spite of the high amount of this enzyme, pyrimidine synthesis
remains in tight control because the activity of the decarboxylase is
inhibited and the level of the enzyme pyrophosphorylase is kept below
normal.<p>

Thus, in plants grown on azauracil, less than usual amount of RNA is
found. Both the level and activity of ribonuclease are also reduced.
Some of the azauracil derivatives function as repressors of RNase and
the azauridine-2':3'-phosphates are digested at only 2/3 to 3/4 rate
of the corresponding normal cyclic nucleotides.<p>

The end result of feeding the mutant with the analog azauracil is a
restoration of plastid differentiation. Actually, in the
azauracil-grown plants more robust chloroplasts can be found than in
normal plants (Figure 3B).<p>

MUTABILITY OF THE PLASTOME<p>

Robbelen (1966) has described a nuclear gene mutant of Arabidopsis
that functions as a mutator of an apparently single plastome site.  We
have isolated three slightly different alleles of a gene locus in
linkage group 3 which enhance the mutability of numerous platome sites
(Redei 1973, and unpublished, Redei & Plurad 1973).<p>

The majority of the plastome alterations interfere with the normal
differentiation of the lamellae. Some of the mutant chloroplasts are,
however, vigorous and functional in photosynthesis in spite of
differences in morphology.<p>

Some plastome alterations involve changes in the structure and
morphology of the leaves and affect male and/or female fertility.<p>

The available information is consistent with the notion that the
genetic material of the chloroplast is synthesized under the control
of the nucleus. We suppose that a plastid DNA polymrase is coded by a
nuclear gene. The error-prone polymerase then may produce a defective
DNA template in this organelle. As a consequence, the defect can be
perpetuated even in the absence of the nuclear gene.<p>

Through backcrosses, and using genetically marked chromosomes, we have
removed the mutator, yet the autonomous maintenance of the defect
continued.<p>

Such a system sheds light on the genetic organization of the platome
and on the nature of coordination within the multi-genomic cell.
Currently we are making efforts to identify directly the biochemical
basis of the mutator effect. We are also in the process of isolation
of homoplastidic alterations. We expect to isolate chloroplast mutants
of nonchromosomally determined inheritance, useful for various types
of genetic studies.<p>

REGULATION OF FLOWER INITIATION<p>

Arabidopsis is a facultative long-day plant according to the
definition of the plant physiologists.  Mutants are now available that
are barely sensitive to long-day treatment (gi) or seem to be day
neutral (co) or others which meet the criteria of obligate long-day
plants (ld).<p>

Under conditions of less than 9 hours of daily illumination the ld
mutants are incapable of flowering.  In complete darkness these
mutants as well as all others, including our standard wild type and
several late-flowering wild ecotypes, flower as early as or earlier
than under the most favorable light regimes (Redei, Acedo & Gavazzi
1974).<p>

Evidently flower initiation is a constitutive process in complete
darkness.  In lgith, flower formation is repressed to variable extent
in the different genotypes.<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol13/vol13-pg117-tab7.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

Table 7: Relative number of rosette leaves of various genotypes of
Arabidopsis developed before the flower primordia became visible
macroscopically.<p>

The promotory effect of long days seems to be due to a secondary
process by which the suppressor is removed or inactivated.<p>

This interpretation of the negative control of flowering in light is
supported by the observations on the flower-inducing effects of
5-bromodeoxyuridine. This nucleoside analog, under conditions of
illumination may reduce the flowering time to 30% that of the contol
but it is completely ineffective under complete darkness.<p>

Bromodeoxyuridine is incorporated into the DNA of Arabidopsis and it
replaces thymidine.  Plants grown on 14-C valine or arginine plus
bromodeoxyuridine bind the label more tightly to the chromatin than in
the absence of the analog.<p>

The chromatin was extracted from the plants with a buffer containing
sodium lauryl sulfate. This detergent solubilizes DNA and most of the
proteins. By such an extraction, the histones are almost
quantitatively solubilized and removed.<p>

The extract was subsequently filtered through a dacron web that
trapped all the highly fibrous chromatin. By conventional methods
(Lowry) no protein was detectable on the filter. Scintillation
counting has shown that the DNA in which 1/4 to 1/5 of the thymine was
replaced by bromouracil, bound 40-70% more radioactivity from the 14-C
amino acids.<p>

Since a single nuclease-free pronase digestion of the chromatin
removed over 90% of the radioactivity, the label must have been
protein.  This protein was insoluble in 0.4 N H2SO4, therefore, it is
considered to be of a non-histone type.<p>

We have not characterized yet in detail this protein capable of
intensive binding to the DNA.  Our assumption is that this class of
non-histone protein is responsible for the early flowering of the
plants grown on the analog media. This protein seems to prevent the
transcription of the flowering inhibitor(s) formed under illumination.<p>

Prokaryotic experiments have shown (Lin & Riggs 1972, 1974) that
bromouracil substitution at the operator site causes a 10-fold
increase in binding of the lac repressor and this attachment can be
reinforced by ultraviolet irradiation.<p>

We plan to characterize this specific protein of Arabidopsis.<p>

CONCLUSIONS<p>

A variety of regulatory mechanisms can be recognized in Arabidopsis by
genetic methods. We have identified a number of systems where part of
the biochemical control is evident.  Regulation in complex organisms
involves multiple components. Because of this complexity it is not
always possible to define the operation of the system in absolute
terms under the majority of conditions. The biochemical leverage
available in the briefly outlined cases may facilitate clarification
of the complex mechanisms of differentiation and development.<p>

Perhaps the time will never come when all the processes of regulation
and differentiation will be understood in specific terms.<p>

Applied biology (agriculture, medicine) will continue, however, to
demand more information in this field because yield, quality, and safe
production of crops all depend ultimately on the tuning of the
(genetic) control mechanisms.  Human health and disease are also the
expressions of genetically and epigenetically regulated mechanisms
within and between organisms.  Arabidopsis certainly appears very
promising for the exprimental study of the basic aspects of these
problems.<p>
