<h2> Fructose-1,6-diphosphate aldolase isozymes in Arabidopsis, Cardaminopsis and Hylandra</h2><p>

Arabidopsis and related species are very sensitive to the degradation
products of fructose, detectable in autoclaved nutrient media
containing this hexose.  It has been shown (REDEI 1972) that fructose
aldolase level is reduced in the plants grown on such media.  KAKLIJ
and NADKARNI (1970) have claimed that in bacteria cultured on ribose
media there was a selective repression of aldolase isozymes.  In the
human congenityl anomaly, hereditary fructose intolerance,
fructose-1-phosphate aldolase activity is deficient (FROESCH 1972).
It was of interest to know the isozyme spectrum in Arabidopsis,
Cardaminopsis and Hylandra under nutrition with autoclaved fructose.
The number of aldolase bands in Cardaminopsis and Hylandra is the
same, 4.  In Arabidopsis one isozymic band was absent, otherwise the
spectrum was identical. The conditions of nutrition did not influence
qualitatively the composition of this enzyme in a form detectable by
the method used (PEHHOET, RAJKUMAR and RUTTER 1966). The number of
aldolase isozymes in another crucifer, radish, was found to be 2
(TAKEO 1969).  The gene responsible for the third aldolase band seems
to be absent in Arabidopsis.  If Hylandra is really a hybrid of
Cardaminopsis and Arabidopsis, there seems to be no dosage effect in
this function.<p>
