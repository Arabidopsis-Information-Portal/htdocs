I would like to draw your attention to two openings for tenure-track faculty at the University of 
South Carolina. These positions are part of a recently funded multi-year plan for hiring in the 
general area of plant signaling.   The successful candidates will join an active group of 
researchers in plant biology (http://www.biol.sc.edu/~plant/PlantBiology/).


STRUCTURE BIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY
THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA

The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry in the College of Arts and Sciences invites applications 
for a tenure-track position in Structural Biology and Biochemistry at the ASSISTANT PROFESSOR level. 
The successful applicant will be expected to develop and maintain a productive, extramurally funded 
research program in the broad area of structural biology including x-ray and electron crystallography, 
electron microscopy (HRTEM) and MS proteomics. New faculty would be expected to actively interact with 
the established groups working in plant virology, nanobiotechnology, plant signal transduction, and 
protein/nucleic acid interactions at the University of South Carolina. The candidate is also expected to 
have a strong commitment to teaching at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Applicants should submit a 
letter of application, curriculum vitae, three letters of recommendation, and a description of research 
plans to Structural Biology Faculty Search Committee, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University 
of South Carolina, Columbia, SC  29208.  The committee will begin reviewing applications November 15, 2006.  
Homepage at http://www.chem.sc.edu/.  The University of South Carolina is an affirmative action, equal 
opportunity employer.  Minorities and women are encouraged to apply. The University of South Carolina 
does not discriminate in educational or employment opportunities or decisions for qualified persons on 
the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation or veteran status.



COMPUTATIONAL NANOSCIENCE

The University of South Carolina seeks to hire three tenure-track faculty members in computational nanoscience 
in one or more of the departments of Biological Sciences, Chemical Engineering, Chemistry, Computer Science 
and Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, or Physics. The goal is a cluster hire of expertise 
independent of department location, although hires will be made into specific departmental tenure-track 
positions.  Successful candidates will have demonstrated the ability to conduct computational nanoscience 
research that augments and complements existing USC expertise in catalysis with special emphasis in fuel 
cell and hydrogen technologies; nanoelectronics; bio/nano particles; polymer nanocomposites; and mathematical 
models and computational approaches for understanding signaling networks in a cellular and organismal context. 
(see www.nano.sc.edu for more information).

Applicants should submit a letter of application, a vita, statements of research and teaching interests, 
names of three references, and copies of selected publications to the Chair of the Computational Nanoscience 
Search Committee, Office of the Dean, College of Engineering and Information Technology, University of South 
Carolina, Columbia SC 29208, or electronically to compunano@engr.sc.edu.  Review of applications will begin 
immediately and will continue until the positions are filled.

The University of South Carolina does not discriminate in educational or employment opportunities or decisions 
for qualified persons on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, sexual 
orientation or veteran status.
