Seeds of race Wilna have been analysed for their amino acid
composition by using a Beckman-Spinco apparatus.  100 mgs. seeds have
been utilised.<p>

The results show that the concentratrations used in culture media are
clearly higher than seed content.  Extensive analysis of morphological
mutants for qualitative and quantitative content of amino acids are
now underway.<p>
