Vol 01:<h2>REDEI, G. P.</h2><h2>New bioassay for vitamin B1</h2>

The discovery of mutants responding to thiamin and to both the
pyrimidine and thiazole moieties respectively makes it possible to
assay directly thiamin + pyrimidine and thiamin + thiazole with py or
tz mutants respectively.  Differential response of the two types of
mutants toward an unknown extract permits the calculation of all three
substances independently.  An Arabidopsis bioassay offers the
following advantages over a microbial technique.<p>

1.  Culture technique and the medium are extremely simple.<p>

2.  Sensitivity is higher than that of fungi and not lower, perhaps
even higher than that of lactobacilli (5 millimicrogram B1 is
detectable) with Arabidopsis.<p>

3.  Almost no equipment is needed.<p>

4.  Contamination or backmutation does not endanger the reliability.<p>

5.  Very little effort is needed to maintain the stocks.  The seed can
be stored conveniently for two years.<p>

6.  Evaluation of the results can be done over a longer peiod of time.<p>

Possible disadvantages:<p>

1.  A test requires about two weeks.<p>

2.  Arabidopsis may be more sensitive to certain toxic substances in
the crude vitamin extract than fungi or bacteria.<p>

3.  If the extract contains thiamin, and nearly equal amounts of both
pyrimidine and thiazole ony the sum of these substances can be
estimated.<p>

In conclusion: under various circumstances an Arabidopsis bioassay may
be superior to the animal or microbial tests available.<p>
