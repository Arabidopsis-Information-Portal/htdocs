Independent Research Fellowships 

*We particularly welcome enquiries by Friday 16 March, 2012.* 

The Department of Plant Sciences at the University of Oxford is keen to hear from early career researchers 
who feel they have what it takes to secure a fellowship from one of the UK or international research sponsors 
and become an Independent Research Fellow in the Department. Fellowship opportunities include: 
* BBSRC David Phillips Fellowship 
* Royal Society University Research Fellowship 
* NERC Fellowship 
* ERC Starting Grants. 

These schemes enable the best early career researchers to establish themselves as independent research 
fellows with their own research groups. The fellowships are prestigious and competitive. Sponsors' 
eligibility criteria apply. 
We can support the best candidates to apply for fellowships. We are also keen to hear from fellows who 
may wish to transfer a current fellowship to the Department.
