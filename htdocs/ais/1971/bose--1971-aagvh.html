In a previous communication (NAPP-ZINN and BONZI, 1970) it was
reported that two dwarf mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana react
differently to gibberellins. The age of flowering was reduced in the
case of ca plants, without having any appreciable effect on their
growth habit.<p>

As these observations were based on treatments given at very low
concentrations of different gibberellins, further studies on ca plants
were carried out with higher concentrations (up to 250 ppm).  The
seeds were sown in the greenhouse at the 12th of February.  The
treatment was started when the plants were 3 weeks old.  0.04-0.05 ml
gibberellic acid solutions were given every third day until the flower
primordia appeared. The following Table summarizes the observations.<p>

The present obsrevations further confirm that gibberellic acid has
decreased the number of days to flowering in ca plants.  It has also
influenced its vegetative growth. For example, the number of
stalk-leaves and the length of the stalk have increased. But
gibberellic acid has not stimulated the growth of the influorescence
to the same extent.  Up to 100 ppm concentration of gibberellic acid,
the plants show no significant response, but with further rise in
concentration (250 ppm) significant differences appear.  Therefore one
can anticipate, that doses higher than 250 ppm of gibberellic acid can
certainly promote the growth of the influorescence.<p>

It may be concluded from the obtained results, that exogenous
treatment of plants with gibberellic acid reduces the number of days
to flowering and also stimulates the vegetative growth. Thus if in the
experiment of NAPP-ZINN and BONZI ca plants failed to overcome their
dwarfism, this was due to the low concentration of gibberellin used by
these authors.  In the present experiment, even the plants treated
with 20 ppm concentration of gibberellic acid are showing clear cut
results with regard to growth habit. This is probably due to the
entirely different experimental conditions prevailing in both
experiments; the previous one was carried out in growth chambers with
continuous illumination, but the present one under greenhouse
conditions.<p>

Table: The effect of gibberellic acid on flowering and growth habit of
the dwarf mutant ca of Arabidopsis thaliana.  The days to flowering
were calculated from the actual day of the calendar, on which the
first stigma became visible.  Counting of the stalk-leaves, and
measurement of the "length of the stalk" and "length of the
influorescence" was done after six weeks of the flowering of the
control plants.<p>
