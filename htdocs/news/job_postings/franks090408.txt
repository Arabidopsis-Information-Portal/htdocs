Postdoctoral Position Available

 Genomic Analysis of Transcriptional Regulation during Carpel Margin Meristem 
Development in Arabidopsis

An NSF-funded postdoctoral position to study the development of the Carpel Margin 
Meristem (CMM) in Arabidopsis is available in the laboratory of Dr. Bob Franks in the 
Department of Genetics at North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC.
      http://www4.ncsu.edu/~rgfranks/index.html

The CMM is a vital meristem that gives rise to the ovules, the precursors of the seeds. 
The postdoctoral fellow will employ a variety of molecular, genetic, and genomic 
approaches to clarify the functions of the SEUSS, LEUNIG and AINTEGUMENTA 
genes in the patterning of the adaxial carpel margin. See Plant Physiol. 2008 
v146(3):1165-81.

A Ph.D. in biology, genetics, molecular biology or equivalent is required. Previous 
experience with Chromatin IP, whole genome expression analyses and/or yeast-two-
hybrid assays will be directly relevant to the goals of the project. Additional experience 
with in situ hybridization, microscopy, and molecular genetic analysis of development is 
desirable.

NCSU’s location in the Research Triangle Area (within a half hour drive of Duke 
University, and UNC, Chapel Hill as well as Syngenta, BASF Plant Sciences, Monsanto 
and Bayer CropScience) engenders excellent opportunities for career development and 
collaborative research projects. The North Carolina Plant Molecular Biology Consortium 
provides additional opportunities for multi-campus interaction with a monthly seminar 
and annual conference.
