<h2>Harvesting large quantities of seed</h2><p>

	For our recombination and reverse mutation studies, large quantities of seed are required.  Such quantities can be obtained only from plants grown on soil.  Harvesting the seeds by cutting off ripe siliques involves much labour, since, due to shedding of the seeds from overripe fruits, several rounds of harvesting have to be carried out in order to obtain the maximal yield.  Moreover, repeated harvesting increases the possibility of errors.<p>

	It turned out, however, that putting sleeves around the plants prevents seed shedding, and, at the same time, makes harvesting much easier.  The sleeves, 30 cm long and +7 cm wide, are cut from a tube of "Visqueen" polyethylene foil (0.008 mm) and put around the plants when the latter are about to produce their first flowers. The sleeves are supported by tripods made of metal wire. The tripods are put over the plants with their legs pushed in the soil.  In every pot a tripod is placed, the sleeve may go either over or inside the tripod. The sleeves are fastened to the tripods with paperclips in such a way that between pot and sleeve a slit remains open, allowing air circulation through the sleeves. To promote this circulation, holes may be punched in the sleeves at about 5 cm from the bottom end.<p>

	For this method it is necessary that the plants are watered from below.  As a routine, in our cultures 7 day old seedlings, after germination on perlite in Petri-dishes in a growth chamber, are transplanted with a dip of perlite to soil in 6 cm plastic pots, which are placed on plastic trays. For irrigation the trays are temporarily filled with water, or, since many of our lines are thiamine deficient, with a thiamine solution.<p>

	In summer, ripe siliques on sleeved plants remain closed; in winter they may open, but the seeds remain attached to the replum.<p>

	Harvesting is very simple:  completely ripe plants, after removal of the tripods, are cut from their base, after which gentle squeezing of the sleeves makes the seeds drop from siliques.<p>

	Unfortunately, there is one drawback to this method. Controlling an aphid or other insect infestation is much more difficult in sleeved plants than in plants grown normally in the open.  A prophylactic spray with a systemic insecticide, e.g., systox, before the plants were sleeved sometimes had a favourable effect, but in a number of cases serious damage was inflicted upon the plants too.<p>
