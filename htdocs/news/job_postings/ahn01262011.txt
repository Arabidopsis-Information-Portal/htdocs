Post-doctoral positions available in molecular genetics and biochemistry. 
Creative Research Initiative, Korea University, Seoul, Korea 


Two postdoctoral researcher positions are available starting immediately 
to study the small RNA-mediated regulation of flowering time and the 
signaling network of flowering time control by ambient temperature at 
Korea University, Seoul, Korea. These are full-time grant-funded 
positions (Creative Research Initiative in Korea). The project will use 
biochemical and molecular genetic approaches of small RNAs, SVP, FLM, 
and FT in Arabidopsis. A Ph.D. degree in plant science, genetics, or a 
related field is required. A strong background in genetics/molecular 
biology/biochemistry is a plus. Successful applicants will be expected 
to show a high degree of research productivity, good communication 
skills (both oral and written), and an ability to work collaboratively 
with other lab members. Starting salary will be commensurate with 
previous experience of the applicant.
