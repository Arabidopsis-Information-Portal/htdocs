This page provides the list of problems to do in the afternoon workshop.

<p>

<HR Size=2 Width=85%>

<p>

The vast majority of the time, searching the on-line sequence
databases (NCBI, EMBL, DDBJ) results in clear answers, a single record
is retrieved and the information is easily accessible.  However,
occasionally there may be situations where the answer is less
obvious. Problems One to Four illustrate this.<p>


<b>Problem One</b><br>

If you go to <a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/>Entrez</a>
and search for entries from Arabidopsis containing the gene
name "AAT1".<br>


<dd>How many genes do these actually represent?

<p>

<b>Problem Two</b><br>

The gene GLP3 (germin-like protein) appears to be part of an extensive
family.  There are nine separate entries for this gene, the GenBank
Locus identifiers are: ATU75189, ATU75190, ATU75196, ATU75197,
ATU75201, ATU75206, ATU95034, ATU95035, ATGLP3.<br>

<dd>Using BLAST, see if you can distinguish the members of this
"family".

<p>

<b>Problem Three</b><br>

Occasionally members of closely-related gene families will be very
similar.  An example of this is the vacuolar H+-pumping ATPase family
referred to as: ava-p (ATHAVAPB), ava-p1 (ATHAVAP), ava-p2 (ATHAVAPA),
ava-p2e (ATHAVAPD), and AVP-3 (ATHAVP3). <p>

Compare the amino acid sequences of these genes by calling up the
GenBank records in separate browser windows (using the locus
identifiers given in parentheses).<p>

Organize the genes into classes based on the protein sequence.<p>

Then take the nucleotide sequence of ava-p (ATHAVAPB) perform a BLAST
search and again organize the genes into classes.  <br>

<dd>Are the classes now different?<p>


<b>Problem Four</b><br>

It is increasingly likely that a gene under investigation is a member
of a previously-defined gene family.  This will become obvious through
BLAST searching, but a more detailed way to examine the level and
extent of homology is to arrange members of a family alongside one
another.<p>

Four such genes can be used to illustrate this.  Two from Arabidopsis,
agamous (ATAGAMSG) and the agamous like gene 5 (ATHAGL5A); a MADS like
gene from pine trees (PRU42400) and an outlying member of this family,
the yeast gene MCM1 (SCMCM1).<p>

<p>Use these locus identifiers to retrieve the FASTA format,
<b>protein</b> record which may then be pasted into the CLUSTALW form
available from Larry Parnell's home page (the address of which is
found on the course home page).<br>
<dd>See if you can identify the MADS box.

<p>

<b>Problem Five</b><br>

Using NetPlantGene and at least one other gene-modelling program from
the <a href=http://nucleus.cshl.org/protarab/AnnotationExternalWeb.htm
TARGET=NEW>list provided by Larry Parnell</a> [also on course home
page], look for genes in Sequence 4 from the <a
href="/uppsala/sequences.html#4"
TARGET=NEW>Sequences and Demo Problems</a> page [also on course home
page].<p>


Once you've done that, BLAST the same sequence using AtDB's form and
find out the AGI clone that the sequence comes from.<br>

<dd>Is this clone annotated in GenBank? <br>
<dd>If not, can you find out if this clone is annotated at the authors' site?<br>
<dd>Where in the genome does this clone lie?<br>
<dd>How does their annotation differ from that predicted using the above programs? 
<p>
Do programs like these provide the complete solution to finding genes in sequence? <p>

<b>Problem Six</b><br>
Use <a href="
/cgi-bin/patmatch/nph-patmatch.pl">AtDB's PatMatch</a> [also on course home
page] - and find out how many Arabidopsis proteins entries do NOT start with a methionine (M, atg)?<br>

<dd>How many start without an M, but then have a methionine as the
second amino acid? <p>

Use SGD and do a similar query in yeast.<p>

Can you think of a reason for the difference in percentage of
yeast versus Arabidopsis proteins in the database that do not start
with methionine? 

<p>

<b>Problem Seven</b><br>

Using Entrez to search PubMed, find how many papers there are
about gene expression in the siliques of Arabidopsis.<br>

<dd>How many of these publications have sequences associated with them?

<p>

<b>Problem Eight</b><br>

You're using myb4 from the top of chromosome III as a CAPS marker, but
are having problems with the primers being non-specific. How would
you find out how to contact the researcher who developed the CAPS for myb4?

<p>


<b>Problem Nine -- Optional</b><br>
If you'd like to be in AtDB's Database, complete an AtDB Colleague
Submission Form.

<p>

<b>Problem Ten -- Optional</b><br>
If you have your own web page, or you run your lab's, work out how to
display the latest AGI totals on your own web page.
