Postdoctoral and Technician Position in Plant Bioenergy Research
Biology Department, University of Massachusetts Amherst
Recently there has been an explosion of interest and optimism in the prospect of 
exploiting “locked away” cell wall sugars to produce biofuel. Amenability to such 
a process is dependent upon overall cell wall composition and the manner in 
which those components interact. One mechanism regulating cell wall 
biosynthesis is the activity of transcription factors that control higher order events 
of growth and differentiation and the likely direct regulation of cellulose, 
hemicelluloses, and lignin biosynthetic enzymes.  We have adapted several 
genomic and biochemical approaches using the model species Arabidopsis and 
Brachypodium to explore the full extent of transcription factor activity as well as 
their overall role in downstream wall phenotypes including bioenergy feedstock 
properties. This project will involve close collaboration with the Mockler Lab at 
Oregon State University and Kay Lab at UCSD. 
A postdoctoral position is available as early as fall of 2008 to study the 
systems biology of plant bioenergy feedstock quality using molecular biology and 
biochemical approaches.  Applicants should have a recent Ph.D. in biological 
sciences.
A laboratory research technician position is available for the fall of 2008.  
Responsibilities include supporting the aforementioned projects, conducting 
experiments, and managing the laboratory.
Salaries and benefits will be competitive and commensurate with experience. 
Interested applicants should send a CV, brief summary of research experience, 
and contact information for at least two references by email to Sam Hazen 
(hazen@bio.umass.edu).
The University of Massachusetts is an Affirmative Action/Equal Opportunity 
Employer. Women and members of minority groups are encouraged to apply.
