A postdoctoral position is available immediately to study RNA silencing and
viral suppression in plants. Plants utilize RNA silencing to defend
themselves from exogenous nucleic acid invaders (i.e. viruses). As an
anti-host defense mechanism, viruses encode suppressors that can block RNA
silencing responses. We have recently demonstrated that CMV 2b disables AGO1
cleavage activity to inhibit RNA silencing and to counter host defense
(Genes & Development. 20:3255-3268). We are now extending our study to
suppressors of several other viruses, and exploring novel mechanisms of
their suppression. For detailed information, please refer to

Applicants process a recent Ph.D. degree with strong background in genetics,
biochemistry and molecular biology. Candidates should be highly motivated
and possess creativity and initiative. Experience with virus/ or
transcriptional gene silencing / or bioinformatics skills will be a plus.
Salary will be competitive and commensurate with experience.
 

Applications are accepted immediately until the position is filled. The
initial appointment is for one year and reappointment will depend on
satisfactory job performance and mutual agreement. Interested applicants
should send a CV, brief summary of research experience, and contact
information for at least two references by email to Xiuren Zhang at
xiuren.zhang@tamu.edu.
