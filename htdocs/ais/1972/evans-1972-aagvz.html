<h2> Variation in 'after-ripening' of seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana and its ecological significance</h2><p>

Many races of Arabidopsis thaliana have seeds which are dormant when
freshly harvested but which show good germination after a period of
'after-ripening' in dry conditions.  In the field, in Britain and
other parts of its range, germination does not usually occur until
early autumn even if the soil is sufficiently moist for long enough to
allow germination. The adaptive signiicance in this context is
obvious: germination at an inappropriate time is less likely.<p>

Within the range of Arabidopsis thaliana there is considerable
variation in summer rainfall, both from place to place and year to
year.  It would seem likely that differences in the after-ripening
period are of importance in the adaptation of the species to the local
environment.  We have therefore investigated variation both between
and within populations in order to clarify the degree of genetic
control and the extent of the correlation with local climate.<p>

A large and thriving population on a disused railway track near
Husband's Bosworth, Leicestershire was used to study within-population
variability.  Freshly ripened seeds were collected from 22 individual
plants and samples set to germinate at 20*degrees*C in constant light
after various periods of dry storage.  There was considerble variation
between the single plant samples in the proportion of seeds which
germinated early.  It was possible to classify each sample into one of
three groups with a high, intermediate or low proportion of early
germinators.<p>

In addition the shape of the germination curves suggests that even
within the progeny of a single plant there is variation between seeds
but there is as yet no actual evidence of the degree of genetic
differentiation. This heterogeneity will ensure that at all times
there will be a reserve of seeds in the soil, and there may also be
carry-over from year to year, ensuring continued survival of the
population.<p>

Large samples, from 25-30 randomly selected plants, were harvested
from the Husband's Bosworth and other populations and germination
tests conducted in the same way.  Sub-samples of these bulk samples
showed a smooth decrease of dormancy with increased time of dry
storage in all poulations. The time for complete after-ripening varied
between populations from two to eight months.  Moreover, there were
greater differences between populations from different areas than
between those from adjacent areas (Fig 1).<p>

Other experiments have shown that the optimum germination temperature
for a population was related to the probable soil temperature at its
point of origin at the normal time of field germination. This was
followed up by tests at 5*degrees*, 10*degrees*, 15*degrees*,
20*degrees*, 25*degrees*, and 30*degrees*C, both in constant light and
in darkness. Sixteen races were investigated.  Again a common pattern
of germination was found. After two months dry storage performance
varied greatly at the different temperatures with an optimum at
5*degrees*C. After four months germination at 5*degrees*C and
10%degrees*C had declined slightly and had increased at higher
temperatures (Fig 2a).  However the degree of after-ripening, as
reflected in the rate and percentage germination, varied from
population to population.<p>

It is suggested that an additional control of germination time is
achieved by this change of optimum germination so that little
germination occurs until the ambient temperature falls (in the autumn)
to a level near to the optimum temperature for germination.<p>

various periods of dry storage.<p>

In practice a combination of increased rainfall and lower average
temperature would allow the characteristic autumn burst of germination
observed in the field.<p>

The variation between populations is significant.  Populations with
the shortest after-ripening period are those from areas with cool,
moist summers and cold winters where seedlings are less likely to be
killed by summer drought, e.g., Mickle Fell (Westmoreland), Ben
Dhorain (Sutherland), Catterline (Kincardineshire), and Stockholm (Fig
2b).  Here early germination should allow maximum vegetative growth
before the very low winter temperatures.<p>

Populations with a definite inhibition of germination at higher
temperatures after four months are those from areas with a rather dry,
warm summer with periods of showery weather, where seedlings
germinating too early are unlikely to survive e.g., St. Dogmael's
Abbey (Cardiganshire).  Husband's Bosworth (Fig. 2c), Whatton
(Leicestershire), Woebley Castle (Glamorgan) Fig. 2d), and Bush
(Midlothian) (Fig. 2f)<p>

There is one notable exception.  The population from the Burren,
County Clare, Eire (Fig 2e), shows the reverse pattern: germination is
high at high temperatures and lower at lower temperatures. There is a
possibility that in this population germination occurs in the spring.
Flowering probably does not take place until August or even September
yet the seeds are dormant at low temperatures for at least four months
and so may be prevented from germinating in the autumn.<p>

Work is proceeding on other aspects of germination behaviour,
particulrly on variation in total percentage germination and
differences in germination in light and dark, in relation to the
possible carry over of seeds from year to year.  It has been shown
that dormancy is often more marked in the dark particularly at high
temperatures and it may be that, in the field, buried seeds may
survive more than one season. This mechanism would provide additional
buffering of the population against catastrophic events, so
contributing to long term stability.<p>

Clearly there are many points at which selection can operate and the
above results are being followed up by selection experiments.<p>
