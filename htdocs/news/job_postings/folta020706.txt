University of Florida-Gainesville, Horticultural Sciences Department
Applications close February 13, 2006

 

We seek a motivated individual to fill a BS-MS level (PhD applicants welcome), 
state-funded technical position in basic and applied plant science.  The position is intended 
to recruit a candidate for a long-term commitment to an ambitious and diverse research program. 

 

The position will require ½ time as lab manager (ordering, radiation compliance, training, etc) 
the other half will be supervised research.  Research directives are currently centered in two major areas.  The first is light-mediated development using the model system Arabidopsis.  The second area is in structural, functional and translational genomics in cultivated (octoploid) strawberry, using our high-throughput transformation system as a surrogate to study gene function.  

 

An ideal candidate will possess demonstrated ability in molecular biology, with skills in tissue 
culture.  Computer abilities will be helpful.  Most of all, the best candidate will have a 
desire to work in a fast-paced, creative environment and integrate well with diverse, 
motivated personalities.
