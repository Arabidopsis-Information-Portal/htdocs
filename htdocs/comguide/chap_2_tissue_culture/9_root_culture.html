(This protocol was placed on the electronic Arabidopsis bulletin board; 
October 1992.)

*  This protocol (Czako, M. & Marton, L.; manuscript in preparation) has 
been developed for the 'RLD' ecotype, both wild-type and transgenic, 
but has also been succesfully used for the Columbia ecotype and its NR 
deficient mutant G-5.  We have maintained one of the cultures for 18 
months and others for more than a year.

1.  MEDIUM
  (i) VITAMIX (500X stock solution) 100 ml-1
Vitamin B1 500 mg 
Vitamin B6 50 mg 
Glycine 100 mg 
Nicotinic acid 50 mg 
Folic acid 25 mg 
Biotin (Vitamin H) 50 mg 

  (ii) ARABIDOPSIS ROOT CULTURE MEDIUM (ARC) 1000 ml-1
MS salts 4.3 g 
Miller's solution  [6% (w/v) KH2PO4 stock solution] 3 ml
myo-inositol 200 mg 
Vitamix stock 2 ml 
Sucrose 30 g 
pH 5.8 (1 M NaOH)
 *  Dispense liquid in 25 ml aliquots into 125 ml Erlenmeyer flasks.

2.  PROCEDURE
  (i)  Inoculate 25 ml liquid MS or ARC medium with one or more seedlings 
or rooted shoots.  Incubate at rt on an orbital shaker at approximately 70-
80 rpm.  They will develop an extensive root system in about two weeks.
  (ii) The roots are then excised and transferred into fresh ARC liquid 
medium and given a 2 d treatment with 0.05 mg-1 IAA.
  (iii) The roots are transferred to fresh ARC medium.
  (iv) The IAA treatment is repeated every 2-4 weeks.

3.  COMMENTS
  (i) The sustained root culture has become hormone independent, 
because it has been growing without IAA treatment for months now.
  (ii) If the roots are chopped into smaller segments at the time of IAA 
treatment, they tend to form a tangle of old and fresh roots, from which 
the fresh roots are difficult to separate.  If a 10-15 mm diameter size disc 
of the root mat is excised from the mass and transferred into fresh 
medium roots will grow out from the 'disc', and the fresh roots are easy to 
separate.
  (iii) These roots are suitable for transformation by our root 
transformation protocol, though the frequency of shoot regeneration is 
not as high as in the cold-stored seedling-derived roots (see Marton & 
Browse 1991, Plant Cell Reports, 10, 235-239), but still very good.  So 
far that has been the only way of clonal (mass) propagation of some 
important (e.g., heterozygotes in our lab) material for transformation and 
biochemical analysis (J. Browse, WSU) purposes.  A further 
improvement is on the way to restore or even to surpass the original 
morphogenic potential and therefore the transformation efficiency.
