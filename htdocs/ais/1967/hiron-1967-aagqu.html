	Arabidopsis thaliana, heterozygous for ch, produces gene specific yellow-green sectors on leaves of plants when the seeds are irradiated with X-rays (HIRONO and REDEI, 1965).  Utilizing this sytem, the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of fast neutrons to X-rays was investigated concerning this mutagenic event.<p>

	Since the mass production of F1 seeds by crossing is burdensome in Arabidopsis, a F2 population from the F1 gi pa/ch was used.  As the distances among these three genes are known (gi-24.8-ch-7.9-pa), the theoretical percentage of the heterozygote for ch in the population can be calculated.  The expected percentage of plants which are heterozygous for ch in the wild phenotype and gi phenotype was determined to be 96.6 and 78.4 respectively.  However, since the ratio of wild to gi phenotypes in the population is 38.7 to 11.5, the expected percentage of plants which are heterozygous for ch in the combined wild and gi phenotype will be 92.4.<p>

	Prior to irradiation, seeds were stored in a desiccator at room temperature over a saturated solution of chronic acid which maintained an atmosphere of 35% relative humidity.  They were allowed to remain in this environment to equilibrate for moisture content for a period of 10 days. The moisture content of the seed was determined to be 7.7%.  Seeds were exposed to both, fast neutrons generated from the Brookhaven National Laboratory Graphite Reactor and 250 kVp X-rays.  Immediately after irradiations, seeds were sown in 4-inch pots and kept under short-day condition in a greenhouse where the temperature was between 20*degrees*C and 25*degrees*C.  The number of wild and gi plants which had yellow-green sectors was scored at six weeks after the treatments.<p>

	The results are shown in the table.  The regression lines were calculated in the range where the number of sectorial plants increased proportionally with the dose. The regression line for X-rays is expressed as y = 2.0900x and the one for fast neutrons, y = 0.1333 + 1.0275x, where y is the percentage of the sectorial plants in wild and gi plants which are expected to be heterozygous for ch and x is the dose expressed in kR.  Since both equations do not have the same y intercept, the RBE can not be otbained by the slopes of the two liens.  The three points of y; 4, 7 and 10 which fall in the linear range were arbitrarily selected and the RBE values were calculated to be 13.4, 11.3 and 10.4 respectively. Taking the average of these three values, the RBE of fast neutrons, employing the heterozygous ch system in Arabidopsis thaliana is 11.7.<p>
