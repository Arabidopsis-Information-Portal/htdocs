The effectiveness and efficiency of the two mutagens in title has been
evaluated by various authors in different kinds of experiments.  Some
data obtained in our laboratory by-products of some other studies, may
be of interest because of the difference in the experimental
technique.<p>

F2 seed of the cross gi 1 ch 1 x gi 2 pa (50% heterozygotes) was
planted by the agar suspension technique at a density of 30 per 5 inch
pots. The seed was either presoaked 24 hrs before X-irradiation or was
treated directly overnight in an ethyl methanesulfonate solution of a
given concentration. The number of seeds treated was about equal in
both series. Within the ranges of these mutagenic treatments,
germination was nearly identical. Survival and fertility were
influenced by the environmental condition of the seasons. Because of
the presence of the two alleles, gi 1 and gi 2, determining late
flowering, the rosettes grew to a large size with excellent sectors
developing.  Many of sectors involved one or more whole leaves. Very
small sectors were ignored because their classification is uncertain;
distinguishing insect or fungus damage from genetic effects is not
always possible.  Sectors extending to at least a half leaf were cut
off, and macerated in 2-3 drops of acetone in 8 x 75 mm test tubes
with a glass rod.  The crude extract was applied to thin layers of MN
300 cellulose powder on glass, and the pigments were separated in a
petrolether-acetone (10:1.2 v/v) mixture for 10 minutes. The presence
or absence of chlorophyll b in the phenotypically ch sectors was easy
to observe.  In less clear cases the use of a Mineralight USV-12
provided the required answer. Chlorophyll appears purple or greenish
in the short wave length UV light, while chlorophyll b fluoresces
bright red.<p>

Details of the experimental results are represented in the table. The
total number of sectors was larger after EMS treatments in comparison
to that in the X-rayed series. The number of sectors varied greatly
from experiment to experiment. The number of phenotypically ch sectors
was larger in the EMS treated series. Chemical analysis demonstrated
that with the exception of one experiment EMS did not produce more
chlorophyll b deficient sectors than X-rays.  Observations made in
other experiments indicate, however, that similar EMS treatments
produce more thiamine requiring mutants than X-rays.<p>

Table : Classification of somatic sectors in gi 1 ch 1 gi 2 pa plants<p>

Somatic sectors in heterozygotes may appear as the result of mutation,
deletion, recombination, non-disjunction, etc.  Recessive mutants in
the second generation of mutagen treated heterozygotes may appear only
as a consequence of mutation or small deficiency. The frequency of ch
sectors in the treated heterozygotes is at least five times higher
than that of the combined frequency of alterations at the several
thiamine loci and even much higher than the induced mutation rate of
the ch locus itself as established from progeny analysis after similar
treatments. Thus the vast majority of the ch leaf sectors were not
produced by mutation or deletion of the wild allele at the ch locus.
If this had been the case, EMS should have produced larger numbers of
ch sectors than X-rays as observed in other experiments where thiamine
mutants were isolated.  (Note that much larger numbers of alterations
can be identified as color sectors than the number of fertil
inflourescence in chimeras bearing mutant sectors.)  If X-ray is less
efficient in producing mutations or small deficiencies than EMS, the
equal or better efficiency of the first agent in the induction of the
somatic ch sectors should be attributed to its effectiveness in
causing recombination and non-disjunction, etc.  Considering these
data and the interpretation, the conclusion should be drawn that
mutagenic efficiency should not be estimated on the basis of somatic
sectoring.<p>
