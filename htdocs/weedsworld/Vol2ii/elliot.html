Weigel spoke about the functions of the meristem identity 
genes LEAFY and<BR>
UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS in establishment of floral meristem 
identity, and in<BR>
induction of the B function organ identity genes AETALA3 
and PISTILLATA. <BR>
Ectopic expression of LFY gives ectopic flowers (in 
the positions where<BR>
shoots would be), and the flowers are of normal structure. 
 35S-LFY also<BR>
causes early flowering in Arabidopsis (as measured by 
rosette leaf number),<BR>
but in short days only.  Remarkably, expression of LFY 
from a 35S promoter in<BR>
Poplar, which normally flowers in five years, allows 
flowering in six months<BR>
in noninductive long day conditions.  Ectopic expression 
of UFO does not give<BR>
ectopic flowers, and gives an abnormal flower phenotype 
in which sepals<BR>
become petalloid and carpels, staminoid.  This mimics 
the phenotype of<BR>
uniform expression of B function genes, showing that 
UFO is sufficient to<BR>
activate the B function organ identity genes.<P>

Irish described experiments on the nuclear localization 
of the B function<BR>
organ identity gene products, the AP3 and PI proteins. 
 AP3-GUS fusion<BR>
proteins, when ballistically introduced to onion cells 
attached to the 35S<BR>
promoter, show GUS staining in cytoplasm.  PI-GUS fusions 
act similarly. <BR>
Delivering both genes to the same cells allows nuclear 
staining.  The<BR>
interpretation given is that an AP3-PI heterodimer localizes 
to the nucleus,<BR>
while each protein alone does not.  If true, this would 
represent a new<BR>
mechanism of nuclear localization in plants and an additional 
level of<BR>
control of the B function genes.<P>

Beth Savidge described the expression of the CAULIFLOWER 
and APETALA1 genes,<BR>
and the consequences of mutations in them.  One consequence 
is that, in an<BR>
ap1 cal double mutant, AG is not activated.  In either 
single mutant it is. <BR>
This indicates a redundancy in the function of AP1 and 
CAL for the induction<BR>
of AG.  35S-CAL and 35S-AP1 plants have an apical terminal 
flower, mimicking<BR>
the tfl mutant phenotype, and showing that either gene 
alone is sufficient<BR>
for converting an inflorescence meristem to a floral 
meristem.<P>

Milo Aukerman summarized the complex interactions of 
the late and early<BR>
flowering genes, and described the molecular cloning 
of the LUMINIDEPENDENS<BR>
late flowering gene.  It codes for a novel protein, 
and when fused to GUS,<BR>
the GUS activity is nuclear.  The LD promoter fused 
to GUS shows that the<BR>
gene is active in young but not old leaves, and is always 
on at the shoot<BR>
apex.  Epitope tagging of the protein allowed quantitation, 
and showed that<BR>
is on at higher levels in floral apices that in seedling 
apices.<P>

Guillermo Cardon described work in snapdragon that led 
to the cloning of two<BR>
zinc finger proteins that bind upstream of the SQUAMOSA 
gene, the snapdragon<BR>
orthologue of APETALA1.  Six similar Arabidopsis genes 
have been cloned, at<BR>
least three of these bind to the AP1 promoter.  One 
of these, SPL3, is<BR>
developmentally regulated and comes on before AP1 as 
assayed by RNA blots. <BR>
The other two (SPL1 and 2) are constitutively active. 
 35S-SPL3 plants are<BR>
early flowering, and also can have bracts under the 
first flower.  It seems<BR>
plausible then that SPL3 is a genuine upstream regulator 
of AP1.<P>

Steven Clark described the CLAVATA genes CLV1 and 3, 
showing that they act to<BR>
suppress excess cell division in shoot and floral meristems. 
 Genetic<BR>
interactions between clv1 and clv3 indicate that they 
act in the same process<BR>
(e.g. clv1/+ clv3/+ plants show a clv mutant phenotype; 
clv1/clv1 clv3/clv3<BR>
double mutants look no different than either single 
mutant).  clv mutations<BR>
act to partially suppress SHOOT MERISTEMLESS mutations, 
indicating that one<BR>
function of the CLV loci is to act opposite to STM, 
such that CLV represses<BR>
meristem cell proliferation (or enhances cell differentiation) 
and STM<BR>
promotes cellular proliferation (or acts against differentiation). 
 The<BR>
molecular cloning of the first of CLV loci, CLV1, was 
described; it appears<BR>
to be a transmembrane receptor ser/thr kinase.<P>
