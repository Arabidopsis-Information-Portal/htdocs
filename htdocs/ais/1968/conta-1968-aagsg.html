Experiments are in progress to determine the changes in sensitivity to
fast neutrons, of tomato and Arabidopsis seeds in the course of
germination.  A summary of preliminary results on the Arabidopsis
experiment is presented below.  The data will be further processed by
electronic computer.<p>

The first experiment included dry seeds and seeds imbibed at
27*degrees*C for 1/3, 1, 3 and 6 hours before irradiation; fast
neutron exposures, in reactor 'BARN', at a dose rate of 2.5 krad/hr in
water (+6% gamma contamination), ranged from 0-180 minutes with an
exta treatment of 300 minutes for dry seeds.  After a total incubation
of 10 hours at 27*degrees*C (including the irradiation time), the
seeds of all treatments were kept on agar at 2 *degrees*C for 6 days,
after which they were returned to 27*degrees*C and continuous light
for germination.  Subsequent treatment was as in the second
experiment.  In the second experiment, seeds were laid out on agar in
petri-dishes, imbibed for 6 days at 2*degrees*C and then incubated
under continuous illumination at 27*degrees*C, for periods of 1/3, 3,
6, 12 and 24 hours respectively, after which they were immediately
irradiated for periods ranging from 0 - 112 minutes.  Temperature and
light remained unchanged during irradiation and throughout
germination, for a period of 7 days. The seedlings were then
transplanted into soil and grown to maturity at 24 / 20*degrees*C (16
hour day / 8 hour night).  The first experiment dealt with changes in
sensitivity during the period of water absorption. The second
experiment was meant to study changes in neutron sensitivity after
imbibition was complete. The 6-day treatment at 2 *degrees*C was
necessary in both cases to induce even germination, but constituted to
some extent a complicating factor in the design of these trials.<p>

First results: Experiment 1: For all criteria studied neutron
sensitivity markedly increased with increasing pre-irradiation
hydration time, mainly during the first 12/3 hours (table).  For
reduction in the percentage of ovules fertilised, sensitivity
continued to increase slowly beyond six hours of hydration.  With
regard to the percentage of ovules fertilised, maximum sensitivity was
reached after less than 3 hours of hydration (dose reduction factor
approximately 3).  Similarly, sensitivity to the induction of
embryonic lethals rose sharply during the first 1/3 - 1 hour of
hydration but not greatly thereafter.<p>

control and the sublethal dose, for different criteria<p>

Experiment 2: For almost all criterial analysed so far there was no
consisstent difference in sensitivity between the incubation
treatments. The percentage of ovules fertilised (average of first 5
siliques on the main stem) was 64% in the unirradiated control and
decreased with dose to reach 17% at the 82 minutes exposure. The
number of ovules per silique, expressed as a percentage of the
control, was reduced to 72%, at the 82 minutes exposure.  Flowering
was slightly delayed at the higher exposures, but somewhat advanced at
low and intermediate exposures, a fact which has not yet been
adequately interpreted. The period from flowering to ripening of the
silique increased slightly but consistently with dose, leading to a
maximum delay of 2/3 day at the sublethal exposure. The frequency of
embryonic lethals (cf MULLER, 1963) was highly variable, though there
was a high correlation with radiation exposure time; no significant
differences were noted between the incubation treatments.<p>

The data suggest that the main 'sensitivity' increase in germinating
Arabidopsis seeds is associated with the actual uptake of water and
only slightly with subsequent metabolic processes. Water uptake causes
swelling of the seeds, an increase in their weight and a change in the
elementary composition and the total amount of H and O atoms. A
preliminary calculation permits the conclusion that the energy
absorbed per seed, or per cell, from fast neutrons is more than
doubled when imbibition is complete. This means that at least 70% of
the so-called increase in sensitivity may be explained by the increase
in energy absorbed. Further calculations allow a more accurate
evaluation of true sensitisation.<p>
