<b>Information within TAIR is in two distinct sections: the 
<a href="http://www.informix.com/">Illustra(Informix)</a>-based database (<a href="/search">Database Table of Contents</a>), or TAIR Database proper, and separate web pages. In general, information in the database is not found in the web pages and <i>vice versa</i>. The TAIR project is gradually migrating data from the web pages into the database.</b>

<p>

The <a href="/search">TAIR Database</a> proper includes interactive physical and genetic
maps, the latest AGI sequencing information, colleague details,
literature, clone and locus data.

<p>

The <a href=/>TAIR web pages</a> provide tools and important information relevant to
the Arabidopsis community and to the general plant biologist. These
include, but are not limited to, BLAST, FASTA, Pattern Matching,
Restriction Mapper, CAPS marker tables, the Weeds World electronic
journal on <i>Arabidopsis</i>, the Electronic <i>Arabidopsis</i>
Information Service journal (EAIS), <i>Arabidopsis</i> BioSci
newsgroup archive, conference listings, splice-site tables, and a
collection of protocols called the Compleat Guide.  These have all
been indexed using a web-search engine and so may be searched as a
whole. Please note, however, that the database cannot be indexed in
this fashion.<p>

<b>If you're not sure where the information you're looking for</b> may
be, <b>either start at TAIR's <a
href=/search.html>Search
Page</a></b> or click in one of the<b> categories displayed on the
left of the <a href=/> home
page</a></b>. This will display links to pertintent information: in
AtDB's database, on TAIR's web pages; and from external resources. 

<p>

To get back to the home page, simply click on the leaf logo, which is
found at the top left-hand corner of each TAIR Web page.
