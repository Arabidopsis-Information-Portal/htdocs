STEROID INDUCTION OF GENE EXPRESSION IN ARABIDOPSIS
<P>
Alan Lloyd<BR>

<P>
 Tight, investigator-controlled conditional gene expression has
a vast number of potential uses in plant biology.  Conditional
mutations have had wide use in biology in a variety of organisms.
 Specific inducible transcription from inducible promoters has
been an invaluable tool in microorganisms e.g. lacZ in E. coli
and Gal4 dependent promoters in yeast.  We and others have worked
for several years to develop conditional gene expression systems
for use in plants.  Ideally such a system would;  1)  provide
specific control over a target gene or set of genes, 2)  this
control would allow the ability to turn genes on and off at will
with the application of the condition,  3)  the condition itself
should be cheap, easy to apply, and have little or no affect on
the biology of the plant.<BR>

<P>
 The perfect conditional gene expression system for plants has
not been developed but there are several options available.  Heat
shock responsive promoters and a system based on the bacterial
tetracycline repressor (1, 2, 3) i.e. a tetracycline responsive
promoter, have been developed and are available.<BR>

<P>
 In this lab we will be inducing and observing a mammalian steroid
responsive gene expression system in Arabidopsis (4, 5).  This
system is based on a fusion between the maize regulator, R, and
the hormone binding domain of the rat glucocorticoid receptor
(R-GR).  As you will see in lecture and lab,  R regulates a suite
of epidermal characters in Arabidopsis,  all of which are under
the control of the TTG locus in Arabidopsis.   We will be observing
leaf trichome induction.  The hormone binding region of the GR
acts as a portable conditional repressor/activator of function
when fused to transcription factors in a variety of eukaryotic
species.<BR>

<P>
 You will be supplied with seedlings of a transgenic Arabidopsis
strain expressing this R-GR fusion in the ttg background.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
WEAR GLOVES for following.  <BR>

<P>
1)  Prepare 300 ml of a 1 &#181;M dilution of dexamethasone (Dex) in
water from a 20 mM stock in  ethanol.  Dex is a synthetic glucocorticoid
derivative.<BR>

<P>
2)  Submerge seedlings growing in 2.5' pots in the Dex solution
in a 500 ml beaker.  Submerge pot and all so that the seedlings
are immersed.  You will need to handle the edge of the pot with
forceps.  Try not to disturb the soil.  Air bubbles may stick
to the plants.  Dislodge them with forceps or a toothpick.<BR>

<P>
3)  Leave seedlings in solution for approximately 1 hour.  Remove
pot of seedlings and drain the excess solution.  Replace in growth
chamber.<BR>

<P>
4)  Observe plants at  24, 48, and 72 hours after treatment under
a dissecting scope.<BR>

<P>
5)  Perform a parallel, mock treatment of seedlings in water and
ethanol as above.
<P>
Because it takes 24 to 48 hours to see the affect of the hormone
application, some plants that were induced earlier will be provided
for observation.<BR>

REPLICA MOLDS AND CASTS OF THE PLANT EPIDERMIS<BR>

<P>
Paul Green and Alan Lloyd<BR>

<P>
 This lab will demonstrate the use of a simple two-step replica
technique that can be used to study patterning and development
of the plant epidermis.  When applied carefully, this technique
is non-destructive and can allow sequential SEM images to be produced
from the same developing surface.  We will apply this technique
to Arabidopsis as well as some tougher plants.<BR>

<P>
1)  The plant surface must be dry.  Soil grown plants are used.
 Insert a toothpick in the soil next to the plant stem.  Glue
(epoxy gel, Devco) the plant stem or any convenient plant part
to the toothpick stake to stabilize the plant.<BR>

<P>
2)  The Mold.  Mix equal volumes (a small drop of each) of the
two parts of the dental impression polymer (Kerr's &quot;Extrude&quot;)
with a toothpick and spread this mix on the surface to be observed.
 Be sure the gel gets into the nooks and crannies.  Allow this
to dry or harden (~10 minutes).  Check the state of polymerization
on the source mixture.<BR>

<P>
3)  Carefully peel this mold from the tissue.  This is where the
tissue damage may occur.  It will require patience and practice
to make good molds without damaging the plant.  Mount the mold
upside down on a slide using more of the same polymer.<BR>

<P>
4)  The Cast.  Fill the negative mold with epoxy cement (5 minute
Epoxy, Devco) using a needle or fine glass rod.  Remove air bubbles
by manipulation with a needle.  Allow this to cure.<BR>

<P>
5)  Peel or pull the cast from the mold.  Many casts can potentially
be made from each mold.  The casts can now be glued to a SEM stub
with epoxy gel and gold sputter coated like any fixed tissue prior
to observation on the SEM.<BR>

<P>
The molds and/or casts can be trimmed to expose surfaces between
leaves or other organs which can't be seen with other non-destructive
continuous developmental studies.<BR>

<B>Buffers</B>
<P>
10X GUS Buffer (10ml):
<P>
 10ml 1 M TRIS pH 7.5
<P>
 290 mg NaCl
<P>
 66 mg K<sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>
<P>

 1ml 10X GUS Buffer
<P>
 2ml Methanol
<P>
 5mg X-Gluc (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-b-D-glucuronidase)
<P>
 7ml Water
<P>
<B>Steps</B>
<P>
1)  Sterile filter freshly made staining solution into a small
petri dish or ELISA well.
<P>
2)  Add explant or whole seedlings to the staining soution.  For
Arabidopsis seedlings grown at high humidity, vaccuum infiltration
is unnecessary.  For woody tissues or leaves with a thick cuticle,
cut tissues and infiltrate 1 minute, releasing vaccuum gently.
<P>
3)  Cover dish and keep in the dark at 37 degrees for 1 hour -
3 days.
<P>
4)  Stained tissue can be destained to remove chlorophyll in ethanol.
Remove staining solution and add, sequentially, 10% ethanol, 25%
ethanol, 50% ethanol, 75% ethanol, 95% ethanol, for 5 minutes
each.  Leave in 95% ethanol until clear.
<P>
5)  Stained tissues can be cleared and mounted for microscopic
analysis. If the tissue has been destained, it is first necessary
to rehydrate by passing tissues through a reverse ethanol series,
as above.  Infiltrate tissues in 25% glycerol in water for 1-3
hours, until they sink.  Mount on microscope slides in 50% glycerol,
and seal with nail polish.<BR>
