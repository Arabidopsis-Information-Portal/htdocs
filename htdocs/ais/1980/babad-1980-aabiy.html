The aim of our investigations has been a comparative study of the
activity of the ferment RPI (E.C.5.3.1.6.) of the carboxylic phase of
photosynthesis in leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana, original race
Enkheim and its two mutants 58/15 and triplex. RPI catalyzes the
isomerization reaction of ribose-5-phosphate into ribulose-5-phosphate
participating in the regeneration of acceptor CO2 in photosynthesis of
ribulose-1,5-diphosphate.<p>

The plants were grown under similar conditions. &#160;The light
sensitive mutant, 58/15 was obtained by treating the seeds of the
original race with ethylmethanesulphonate. Insufficient light as well
as bright light resulted in less viable plants of the mutant. The
plants did not accumulate biomass when the light was insufficient
while the bright light yielded chlorophyll photodecomposition
(Yakubowa et al., 1980). In the spontaneous mutant triplex, mutation
led to an increase of the number of pods in one fruitstalk from 3 to
5. The increase of the fruitstalks, pods and the number of seeds
allowed it to call the mutant high productive. It was etablished by
genetic analysis, that the mutation in both genotypes concerns the 5th
linkage group.<p>

Ferment preparations of RPI from the original race and the mutants
were isolated simultaneously. All the procedures of the RPI-isolation
were carried out under cold temperature of 0 to 4*degrees*C. Leaves
were rubbed in triple-volume 0.1M tris-HC1 buffer, pH 8.0, containing
B M: MgC1 - 0.005, NaC1 - 0.2, reduced glutathion - 0.01. The
homogenate was centrifuged with 18000 rpm for 1 hour. The protein
quantity was determined in the supernatant by Lowry's method (Lowry et
al., 1951) and the activity of RPI by Axelrod and Iang's modified
method (Axelrod and Iang, 1954).<p>

Table 1: Enzyme activities in A. thaliana, race Enkheim and the
mutants 58/15 triplex.<p>

From the data presented in the Table 1 it is evident, that the
specific RPI-activity of mutant leaves 58/15 is slightly lower than
that of the original race. RPI-activity of triplex mutant leaves is
25% higher than that of the original form Enkheim. Data of the
RPI-activity per gramme of crude weight of leaves show, that the
activity of both mutants is higher than that of the original form.<p>

These results prove the increase of the protein content as well as of
the RPI-ferment in the mutant leaves.<p>
