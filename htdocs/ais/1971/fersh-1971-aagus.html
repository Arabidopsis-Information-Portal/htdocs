Multivariate statistical methods allow the quantitative description of
populations.  One of the important statistical parameters is the
correlation coefficient r, which estimates the degree of conjugation
for variations of population characters.  In evolution, particularly
organism-environment interrelations create the prerequisite for the
formation of correlation galaxies, i.e., the presence of correlations
within complexes of characters in the absence of correlations between
characters of different complexes. Correlation galaxies exist at
different levels: ontogenetical, specific, biocenological, etc.
Ecological reasons for the formation of correlation galaxies during
the natural selection process and the general principle of the
occurrence of independence for individual character is formulated by
R.L. BERG (1964).<p>

Suppose a population of individuals is described by n-characters: x1,
x2..., xn.  Let the new character, presenting a linear combination of
initial characters w1 = b1x1 + b2x2 + b3x3 + ... +bnxn be the first
factor.  The coefficients b1, b2..., bn are to be found from the
condition of maximum correlation of w1 with all the initial
characters, i.e. we obtain the maximum<p>

Evidently, b1, b2,..., bn are the contributions of each of the initial
characters in w1.  Let the second factor w2 be a new character,
introduced in the same way as w1, but with the additional condition
r(w1, w2) = 0.  Let the third factor w3 be another character,
introduced similar to w1 and w2 but with the additional condition:
r(w1, w2) = 0 and r (w2, w3) =0.  As the factors absorb the maximum
information of the initial characters, the procedure allows to choose
the most essential characters and groups of characters and aids in
interpreting the biometrical investigation of populations.<p>

Our investigations were based on a natural population of Arabidopsis
thaliana (L.) HEYNH., race Enkheim.  The plants were grown in test
tubes on mineral medium (IVANOV et al., 1966).  The test tubes were
placed in randomized blocks under light installation.  The studied
quantitative characters and their principal statistical parameters are
given in Table 1.  All the statistical parameters have been calculated
with high accuracy (P &lt; 0.01).<p>

of a natural population of Arabidopsis thaliana<p>

The total of the quantitative characters, describing the main
development phases of the plants, forms a correlation galaxy of
ontogenetical level.  It can be assumed that close correlation is
caused by the control of the coupled genetical factors over the
characters.<p>

Table 2 presents the data on factor analysis of quantitative
characters for the investigated natural population.<p>

In the contributions of the characters 1 to 4, describing the main
development phases for Arabidopsis thaliana, are significantly higher
than the contributions of the characters 5 to 8.  Opposite to that, in
w2, the contributions of the vegetative characters 5, 6 and 8 are
large, and in w3 the contribution of the character 7, typical for
fertility, is large as well.  This allows to give a new complex
characteristics of Arabidopsis populations, and to interpret w1 as
"the development phase factor", w2 as "the vegetation factor" and w3
as "the fertility factor".  These three factors absorb 68% of the
information on the population.<p>
