	1-methyl-3-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidine (MNG) induces a high frequency of mutations in Arabidopsis (MULLER and GICHNER, 1964) but no mutations in barley (EHRENBERG and GICHNER, 1967).  There are also differences in the M1 generation.  In Arabidopsis the M1 root length decreases with the increasing MNH concentration, but the germination remains unchanged up to very high concentrations (Figure 1).  After the action of MNG on barley both the germination and seedling height decreases with the increasing MNG concentration (Figure 2).<p>

1-methyl-1-nitrosourea (MNH), which induces mutations in Arabidopsis (VELEMINSKY et al., 1964; MULLER, 1964) and barley (EHRENBERG and GICHNER, 1967), influences the M1 germination of both species only at extremely high concentrations (Figure 1 and 2).<p>

	Considering that in both species the seeds were treated with MNG, one may assume that the differences in the M1 generation are caused by differences in seed metabolism. These results show that although Arabidopsis is an excellent model plant for theoretical mutation studies the results obtained may sometimes be different from those with other plant species.  Detailed results are in press (Biologia Plantarum, 1967).<p>
