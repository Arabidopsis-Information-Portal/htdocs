The new powerful mutagens induce a very wide spectrum of chlorophyll
mutations.  Of special interest are allelic mutations.  Genetic
analyses of viable chlorophyll mutations induced in our laboratory by
gamma-rays and EMS and of mutations kindly supplied by Prof. Robbelen
revealed that our mutation viridoalbina 40/3, induced by irradiation
of seed (40 kR), is allelic to Robbelen's mutation "weiss
ausbleichend, V-155/2.  The F1 hybrids are all alike V-155/2.  The F2
segregate monofactorially.  Reciprocal crosses give the same results.<p>

The responses of these allelic mutations to environmental conditions,
however, are very different.  In the beginning of the development they
are phenotypically alike, later viridoalbina 40/3 grows very slowly.
In the greenhouse, during the autumn-winter season, plants of V-155/2
are almost fully green, while viridoalbina 40/3 is green, white, small
and weak.  In the spring-season in the greenhouse they are
phenotypically alike, but differ in size.<p>
