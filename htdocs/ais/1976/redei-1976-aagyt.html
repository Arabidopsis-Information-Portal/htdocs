<h2>ARABIDOPSIS RESEARCH; RETROSPECT AND PROSPECT</h2><p>

G.P. REDEI<p>

Department of Agronomy<p>

University of Missouri, Columbia, MO 65201 U.S.A.<p>

The Chairman of the Organizing Committee, Professor Kranz, charged me
with an awesome duty: of surveying the past, present and the future of
our beloved organism, Arabidopsis.<p>

Certainly, I cannot go into details of our past accomplishments.  In
the last few years a number of reviews have been published (Ivanov
1974, Redei 1970, 1974, 1975) that can serve the purpose of a
retrospect.<p>

I feel the timing of our meeting was appropriate since it will be 400
years ago that Johannes Thal completed the botanical description of
the wild forbear of Pilosella siliquosa, now a domesticated laboratory
organism.<p>

The place of our conference is also well chosen since the late
Professor Friedrich Laibach who for over 60 years--partly in
Frankfurt--almost alone, developed Arabidopsis to an ubiquitous and
respected research organism. There is barely any successful work with
Arabidopsis that would not bear the impact of his pioneering and
visionary efforts.<p>

In his keynote address to the first International Symposium on
Arabidopsis Research, April 21-24, 1965, Profesor Laibach said, "Und
wennbleigh dabei Viren und Bakterien sicherlich manches Grundsatzlich
aufzeigen konnen, so konnen sie auf das Problem der Entwicklung und
Phylogenie bei den Blutenpflanzen doch wohl scherlich die letzte
Antwort geben."<p>

Thus, obviously the research with Arabidopsis should not emulate the
work with any organisms. Due to the unique biological properties of
this plant, it can be useful for the study of problems that are not
amenable to direct attack by other organisms.<p>

GENETIC MATERIAL AND INFORMATION TRANSFER<p>

Though Arabidopsis is no more the second lowest chromosome number
plant as it was when Laibach began his resarch in 1905, it is still
the lowest among the angiosperms, suitable for efficient experimental
genetics.<p>

The DNA content of its nucleus appears to be the lowest among the
higher plants (Sparrow et al., 1972, Bennett 1972).  Certainly, it
seems that Arabidopsis and some close relatives have considerably less
redundancy in the nuclear DNA than most other plants. This appears to
be of special value in any analysis concerned with the genetic
organization at the molecular level.<p>

The DNA content of the nucleus does nto seem to be correlated with the
DNA content of the cellular organelles.  Thus, Arabidopsis may be a
favorable object to study the multigenomic, nuclear, plastidic and
mitochondrial organization, and coordination. This whole area is
practically unexplored.<p>

Recent development in the use of restriction nucleases, may open up
special opportunities in Arabidopsis.  This plant seems to me the
choice among higher plants for plasmid technology because of the above
mentioned characteristics.<p>

It is unfortunate that the continued efforts to carry out genetic
transformation with isolated heterologous DNA (Ledoux et al. 1974) are
unsuccessful (Hotta & Lurquin 1975, Redei et al. 1976).  Certainly,
the failure should not result in the abandonment of this type of an
inquiry. Transformation can be readily accomplished in Penumococcus,
Bacillus subtilis and some other species but it became feasible only
recently in Escherichia coli and only with some limitations.
Hopefully, new attempts at this problem will bear fruits in the
future.<p>

The availability of obligate auxotropyhs in Arabidopsis makes this
organism uniquely fit for this and similar types of experiments where
selective techniques are mandatory for success.<p>

Transgenosis (Doyu et al. 1973) has generated considerable excitement
a few years ago.  I would like to see direct genetic evidence
forthcoming concerning the role of the phage-carried DNA within the
plant cells.  I do not know whether the process involves selection
among the different cell lineages of the callus, some kind of a
habituation process or it is rather of the transduction type.<p>

The cauliflower-mosaic virus, having double-stranded DNA as the
genetic material, and a parasite of the crucifers, may be worth for
consideration as a potential vehicle in information transfer. With the
genetic information already available in Arabidopsis or easily
securable when needed, we can explore this problem under critical
experimental conditions.<p>

GENE FUNCTION<p>

Since the initial success by Langridge (1955) over 20 years ago,
several laboratories (Redei 1960; Feensta 1964; Li & Redei 1969;
Jacobs 1965; Kasyanenko et al. 1972) have made attempts to isolate
true auxotrophs. Though mutants requiring thiamine can be obtained at
a rate comparable to micro-organisms, other obligate auxotrophs are
conspicuously absent. Acording to one of my calculations, I would have
expected to find about 4000 mutants requiring organic substances other
than thiamine, yet none were found. The few spurious nutritional
mutants in Arabidopsis as well as in the majority of other organisms
failed to meet the specific criteria of auxotrophy.<p>

It is hard to conceive why only thiamine mutants--though at different
loci--can only be induced or isolated. Recently in maize, an organism
far less easy to handle than Arabidopsis under the required type of
experimental conditions, Gavazzi et al. (1975) have obtained a true
proline mutant. Thus, perhaps there is no intrinsic obstacle for
finding auxotrophs; perhaps only a different selection procedure is
needed.<p>

The leucine mutant of Kasyanenko and associates appears to be more of
a regulatory mutant than a true auxotroph.  Unfortunately, I have no
information concerning the enzyme(s) concerned with the branched chain
amino acid pathway of that mutant.<p>

The significance of this problem is not diminished by the lack of
success. Classical genetic analysis would profit enormously by the
availability of such mutants by making possible the application of
selective techniques. Auxotrophs could be exploited for the study of
the mechanisms of reverse mutation. True back-mutants have never been
demonstrated by incontestable evidence in any higher plant.<p>

Recent years, considerable interest was generated in exploitation of
parasexual mechanisms in higher plants (Chaleff and Carlson 1974).
Protoplast fusion, somatic cell hybridization could be greatly
facilitated by the availability of auxotrophic mutants. Conditional
lethals would be highly valuable for experiments in transfers by
plasmids, for transformation, for high resolution recombination and in
the direct study of plant metabolic pathways.<p>

Geneticists working with higher plants often assume as if the genetic
material would be arranged in operons. For this particular type of
genetic organization in eukaryotes there are very scanty examples.
Recently, Schwartz (1976) concluded that in maize some similar type of
structural organization exists in the alcohol dehydrogenase system.<p>

Either auxotrophs with identified enzyme basis, or other mutants
concerned with characterized enzymes may be useful in pursuing such a
quest.<p>

Three of the known thiamine loci each have been assigned to different
chromosomes.  Just very recently, we have found out that the thiazole
and the thiamine-1-loci, with similar yet different functions are on
the same chromosome arm. We do not know yet, however, how close is the
linkage. This can be, however, easily determined by recombinational
analysis under conditions for restrictive growth.<p>

Perhaps a survey of functionally related enzymes by trisomic analysis
even in the absence of mutants may provide some clues to the possible
linkage of functionally related genes. We have 4 of the 5 primary
trisomics, that may be used to assign gene functions to chromosomes on
the basis of dosage effect in the absence of mutants.<p>

REGULATION OF GENE ACTIVITY<p>

No other higher plant can be cultured with equal ease in large numbers
under carefully controlled conditions. This advantage can be well
exploited by studying regulatory mutants.  Though obligate auxotrophs
are hard to get, there is no problem to obtain morphological (Reinholz
1967) or physiological mutants (Redei 1975).<p>

The majority of them are expected to be due to mutations in regulatory
genes. This group contains resitance mutants like some of Feenstra's
(Oostindier-Braaksma & Feenstra 1973), affected in the nitrate
reductase genes, Kasyanenko's leucine mutant (Kasyanenko et al. 1972),
the various chlorophyll defects reported by a number of workers (Kranz
1973), the "antimetabolite-requiring" mutants of my laboratory or the
analog resistance cases in Jacobs laboratory and several others that
we will hear in the following reports.<p>

The real benefit of these types of mutants will be an insight into the
mechanisms of differentiation and development.  Many years ago
Robbelen (1959) showed how subsequent steps in plastid differentiation
can be followed by ultrastructural analysis of the plastid mutants.<p>

The studies of Usmanov and Nasyrov's laboratory are expected to
provide an insight into the problems of C3 and C4 metabolism in
photosynthesis.<p>

Recently several methods became available for the screening of mutants
affected in photosynthesis (Miles 1975).  These techniques should be
quite applicable to Arabidopsis where practically unlimited
populations can be screened.<p>

MUTATION<p>

After several years of very active interest in mutation in Arabidopsis
particularly by Muller, Veleminsky and Gichner, Robbelen, and others
(summarized in Redei 1970), there seems to be somewhat reduced
activity in the field.<p>

This area deserves more consideration.  Mutational analysis can reveal
important aspects of ontogenesis as shown by the studies of Muller
(1963) and Grinikh et al.  (1974), Shevchenko et al. (1975).<p>

Arabidopsis has important potentials for screening of indirect
environmental mutagens. Recent years it became apparent that innocuous
chemicals can be transformed by the cell metabolism into carcinogens
and mutagens. These transformations by plants may represent a threat
to all organisms in the food chain depending on plants.  The role of
plants cannot be studied without plants. Certainly Arabidopsis is the
prime choice because of the population sizes that can be manipulated
at low cost and because of the very short life cycle of the plant.<p>

Muller's embryo test or the improved screening methods (Redei 1974) in
conjunction with the more conventional approaches cannot be easily
surpassed in any other plant system.<p>

In tissue culture work (Rice and Carlson 1975), there is considerable
interest in developing selective screening methods for dominant
resistance mutants. These techniques in Arabidopsis do not necessarily
require the manipulation of isolated cells. Feenstra has shown that
chlorate resistant mutants occur and can be isolated among intact
seedlings.<p>

Imaginative approaches have been designed for the selection invertase
mutants by D'Sousa & Maher (1974).  In maize, the wild type pollen
converts the relatively harmless allyl alcohol to the highly toxic
acryl aldehyde in a suicidal manner, but the alcohol dehydrogenase
mutants selectively survive (Schwartz and Osterman 1976).  In a
similar vein, feedback insensitive mutants (Demain 1971) should be
possible to isolate in Arabidopsis without resorting to isolated cell
culture.<p>

Both specific (Robbelen 1966) and a more generalized type (Redei &
Plurad 1973) plastome mutator genes have been identified in
Arabidopsis. Such mutants can be used to enhance the variability of
the non-nuclear genetic elements and can be applied to study their
mechanism of mutagenic action as initiated in my laboratory.<p>

MANIPULATION OF ISOLATED CELLS<p>

Arabidopsis grows remarkably well as a callus.  Occasionally
redifferentiation can be obtained (Gresshoff and Doy 1972). This area
of investigation deserves special interest. The small size of the
plants and the easily controlled conditions of culture may be an
unequalled advantage in further handling of all types mutants of
descendants of "transformed" cells.<p>

Successful pollen culture patterned after the methods of Nitsh is
still unresolved. Redifferentiation of haploid or diploid single cells
into seedbearing plants is not feasible yet at a practical scale.<p>

Isolation and redifferentiation of cells into plantlets would have
numerous appications in the study of somatic mutations, mitotic
recombination (Demchenko et al. 1975), and somatic hybridization.<p>

QUANTITATIVE GENETICS<p>

Quantitative variation on the very stable isogenic background of
Arabidopsis offers unique potentials also because of the stringent
controls of the environmental conditions. A practical plant breeder
may test the validity of a model between summer harvest and spring
planting by five generations if necessary. Thus, faster progress may
be achieved at lower cost. For these purposes, Arabidopsis have barely
been used in spite of its eminent suitability as a pilot organism for
plant breeding.<p>

POPULATION GENETICS<p>

The available physiological variants in nature have been successfully
surveyed and interpreted in a number of species.  In Arabidopsis such
a work was quite limited so far though the usefulness of such
approaches has been proved (Jacobs & Schwind 1975).<p>

CYTOGENETICS<p>

Arabidopsis is not a choice organism for these types of studies
because of the small size of the chromosomes. For electronmicroscopic
approaches, the disadvantages experienced with the light microscope
may turn to our advantage. The few and small chromosomes may provide
unique potentials for the analysis of fine stucture.<p>

A remedy of the deficiency of Arabidopsis reseach, the expanding of
the chromosome mapping information, is mandatory. Without
appropriately marked chromosomes, critical analysis is greatly
hampered in many areas. Altogether thousands of genes are available in
this 5-chromosome pair plant. The morphological distinctness of the
trisomics makes it easy to assign genes to chromosomes. The large
population sizes available for manipulations may make practical even
the establishment of gene-centromere relations (Lee-Chen &
Steinitz-Sears 1967)<p>

EVOLUTION<p>

Since the pioneering work of Laibach (1958), promising approaches were
made to identify the taxonomic relations of Arabidopsis (Berger 1968,
Mesicek, 1967).  Our recent experience reveals that quite unexpected
trigeneric hybrids among Arabidopsis, Cardaminopsis arenosa, C.
petreae and Hylandra can be obtained. These types of inquiries are
expected to shed light on the genetics and molecular homologies of
chromosome evolution.<p>

ARABIDOPSIS IN THE CLASSROOM<p>

During the last decade Arabidopsis gained increased importance in
biological instruction.  A large number of genetic and physiological
experiments can be designed for one-semester courses. The students can
raise three generations during the 4 months time. They do not need
expensive greenouse facilities or growth chambers.  Arabidopsis can be
grown to maturity under a few fluorescent lamps in any laboratory or
old refrigerators can be easily converted to very good growth cabinets
by replacing the original thermostats with air-conditioner thermostats
and by the installation of two to four 15 W fluorescent tubes.<p>

Nutritional mutants, Mendelian segregation, linkage and recombination,
differentiation, mutagenesis, plant morphology and anatomy, enzyme
assays and a series of other experiments have been successfully used
at several schools.<p>

CONCLUSION<p>

I am fully aware that this sketchy overview missed many important
aspects of our present and future endeavours.  I am sure the following
lectures and discussions will help to complete the tableau.<p>

I believe 12 years ago it would not have been possible to outline the
course of research we have taken. Thus, even if you do not raise the
question 'quod ridet haruspex', I feel I am practicing that dubious
profession.<p>

If I disregard the details and consider only our major goals and
potentials, I have to agree with the prophecies of Professor Laibach
expressed in Gottingen 12 years ago: "Bei dem Versuch, disem Ziel
naher zu kommen, kann, so bin ich sicher, die kleine Arabidopsis
thaliana Helfer, vielleicht Schrittmacher sein".<p>
