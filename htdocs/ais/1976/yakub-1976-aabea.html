Investigations in chlorophyll mutants are very important for the
elucidation of the genetic control of the structure and function of
the photosynthetic apparatus.<p>

Therefore, the use of mutants deprived of some components of the
electron transfer (cytochrome, plastochinone, plastocyanine, etc.) is
one of the approaches to the peculiarities of the photosynthetic
electron transport and the processes connected with it as well as to
reveal the regulator mechanisms.  In this connection the investigation
of photoinduced processes in some photochemical reactions of
photosynthesis connected with electron transport is of interest.<p>

Leaves and chloroplasts of A. thaliana En (race Enkheim) as well as
the monohybrid mutant 58/15 (viridis), induced by 1%
ethylmethanesulfonate were the subject of this study.<p>

The parameters of the photoinduced state were: delayed light emission
(EPR) changed absorption in the spectral area of 520 nm, oxidizing and
restoring changes of cytochromes.<p>

Previously published data on the delayed light emission, absorption
changes in the blue and green area of the spectra at 520 nm and
absorption of the cytochrome component in the area of 554 nm (M.M.
Yakubowa et al., 1975). in intact leaves of A. thaliana and mutant
58/15 have been confirmed by new series of experiments.<p>

Indices characterizing photoinduced changes of the isolated
chloroplasts have been obtained which is shown in figure 1-3.  In
total they confirm the results obtained from intact leaves. As it is
well known the delayed light emission reflects the primary
photosynthetic processes connected with participation of the pigment
system in the progress of storing and spending of the absorbed energy.
Both the original form En and the mutant 58/15 yielded the same type
of induction curve; however, the intensity of the delayed light
emission of the mutant is much weaker than that of the control.  This
kind of reduction is usually connected with the quantitative change of
plastid pigments (LITVIN and KRASNOVSKY, 1967).<p>

The delayed light emission with DCMU demonstrates the decrease of the
signal amplitude testifying the defect of the electron transport in
the chloroplasts of both genotypes studied.<p>

The photoinduced signal EPR showed the presence of the photoactive
pigment P700b in the chloroplasts of the original form as well as in
the mutant 58/15. The decrease of the light signal in the chloroplasts
of 58/15 is supposed to be caused by the decrease of the longwave
forms of chlorophyll and the reaction centres of photosystem I (Figure
2).<p>

The difference spectra "oxidized-restored" showed the presence of one
maximum in the spectral area of 554-559 nm in the original form En and
one maximum in the area of 559 nm while there is no maximum in the
area of 554 nm in the mutant 58/15 (Figure 3)<p>

The data of the photoinduced absorption changes in the area of 554 nm
in leaves of the mutant 58/15 suggest a defective function of the
components of electron transport of the photosynthetic cytochrome with
a maximum of absorption in the area of 554 nm.<p>

Therefore, following the hypothesis of - one gene - one enzyme - we
can see the simultaneous changes of various components near the
longwave system indicating that they have either a common biosynthetic
reaction chain or a link which is under the control of one gene.  It
seems to be more logical to assume a damage of the protein carrier
synthesis near photosystem I.  From this viewpoint we have a gene
influencing a protein-carrier on which the electron transport
functions.  It is sufficient to injure the protein configuration to
have damage in the electron transport chain even if all the chain
components are present.<p>
