<h2> Analysis of within family phenotypic variation in a natural population of Arabidopsis</h2><p>

A group of nine families of the Hl-1 population were prevously found
to be highly variable for the phenotypic criterions of rosette size
and number of days to flowering (KARBE and ROBBELEN, 1968).  Six of
these families were further tested to determine whether the variation
was genetically controlled.  Such variation would suggest that
hybridization was taking place among the "pure lines" within a race,
or that genetically variable lines were being maintained in the
natural population.<p>

Seeds of single S1 plants that appeared to be phenotypically different
were planted for progeny testing. The analysis of the data showed that
with a few exceptions, the means of the S2 progeny of parent plants
from the same family were not significantly different with respect to
rosette diameter (Table 1).  Therefore, it appears that the phenotypic
differences between the individual S1 plants were due largely to
nongenetic factors.  It is possible, that the same seed dormancy and
following ratardation of growth contributed to the phenotypic
variability in the S1 generation.<p>
