*  This is a  method for preparing chromosomes from single flower buds 
of A. thaliana.  It does not kill the plants, thus allowing the determination 
of their chromosome number throughout development.

*  The procedure is almost identical to that given for preparation of root 
tips in the "In situ hybridisation..." protocol given in this manual.  The 
differences are detailed below.

1.  MATERIAL
 *  Use immature flower buds of Arabidopsis thaliana (size about 0.5 mm).  
Fix exactly as for  root tips [Section 2, (i)-(iii)].

2.  CHROMOSOME PREPARATION
 *  As for root tips [Section 3, (i) - (vii)], except digest in enzyme [step
(ii)] for 1 - 1.5 h. 

3.  STAINING
 *  Fluorescent staining with DAPI (4'-6-diamino-2-phenylindole) is 
recommended.  Follow steps  (i) and (ii) for DAPI counterstaining 
[Section 9, Fluorescent detection and amplification], then:

  (iii) Mount in Citifluor AF1 antifade (keeps c. 6 months in fridge) or in 
McIlvine's buffer (keeps c. 1 week in fridge) for direct examination with a 
fluorescent microscope.
