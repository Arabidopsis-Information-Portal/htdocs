Most of the recessive fusca mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana (MULLER
and HEIDECKER, 1968) are unable to grow on mineral medium or on medium
supplemented with sugars, amino acids, vitamins or extracts from
wildtype plants.  These lethal fusca mutants can be roughly divided
into two groups: (1) mutants with an early lethal phase which die
immediately after germination, and (2) mutants with a somewhat later
lethal phase developing a short root and some very small rosette
leaves.  In order to get some information about organ-specific
expression of the genes involved, we tried to culture excised roots of
lethal fusca mutants. Wherease the early lethals failed to grow, all
the mutants with residual growth of the seedlings developed excisable
roots which were continuously propagated for over 9 months.  The root
cultures of three mutants (fusA344, fusD262, fusD122) differed
insignificantly in growth rate from the wildtype "Dijon G".  Escised
roots of the other mutants (fusD120, fusD136, fusD123, fusD307,
fusD282, fusD109) are characterized by lower growth rates, but can be
cultivated continuously by repeated cloning and transfer to fresh
medium.<p>

We used the methods described by NEALES (1968) for culture of excised
roots of A. thaliana with some modifications: The seeds were surface
sterilized in 0.01% HgCl2 for 10 min, three times washed with sterile
distilled water and set to germinate in petri dishes on agar medium
(24*degrees*C, light).  After 8-12 days the seedlings were transferred
to 100 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 ml of liquid medium.  The
cultures were then incubated at 27*degrees*C in the dark for 2 weeks,
during which the main root of the wild type reached 5-7 cm and many
lateral roots emerged.  The shoot bleached out and died.  Only at this
stage the roots were excised and cut into 4 or 5 pieces which were
then singly transferred to new flasks.  Late excision proved
advantageous for cultivation of the mutants.<p>

The medium used was that of WHITE modified according to STREET and
McGREGOR (1952) which contains inorganic salts, sucrose and vitamins.
iron was supplied as Fe-EDTA.  The pH was adjusted to 5.0 before
autoclaving.<p>

Table: Effect of temperature on growth over 34 days of excised roots
of strain "Dijon G". Final weight is given by the mean values of 5
cultures. The innocula weighed 20-30 mg (fresh) and 2-3 mg (dry).<p>

The effect of temperature on growth of excised roots of the wildtype
"Dijon G" is given in the Table. The optimum temperature was about
27*degrees*C.  A comparison of our results with the results obtained
by NEALES (1968) shows that excised roots of "Dijon G" are much more
sensitive to deviations from optimum temperature than roots of strain
"Estland".<p>
