AIS Vol 02:<h2>Flower malformations in mutants as a means of partitioning the developmental process</h2><p>

During morphogenesis of flowers two phases can be distinguished with
regard to the temporal succession of differentiation: 1.  the total
histological partition of the apical shoot meristem into definite
areas producing flowers with a specific number of whorls, and 2. the
partition of the growing points of the flowers into zones of different
function.  These two independent processes normally closely coordinate
the 5 whorls of a cruciferous flower with their specific function.  In
consequence of gene mutations this coherence of apatial and functional
partitioning, however, can be disordered, and the basic independence
of both processes may be demonstrable (cf. for literature: GOTTSCHALK
1964).  This, in fact, holds for three instructive X-ray induced
mutants of Arabidopsis, race Antwerpen, segregating from heterozygous
plants in the X2-generation in monogenic ratios. These mutants proved
to be entirely sterile, and thus could not be maintained.  Therefore
their following descriptions will give the protocol designations only.<p>

Mutant 24/17: Vegetatively the mutant develops an entirely normal
rosette. The inflorescence appears only little later than normal, but
the leaves at the inflorescence shaft remain narrow with growth
deformations and brownish patches resulting from cellular
disorganisation in the mesophyll.  The shaft branches early and
intensively, but elongates only to half the height of the normal.  The
main defect, however, manifests itself at the shoot apex (Fig. 1a).
The primary ridges for the flower formation are growing all around the
apical cone in a number of nearly the double of the usually formed
flowers.  But they cease the development with a short filiform tip
without any indication of leaf. This makes the shoot tip look like a
disected apical cone of a hydrophyte (e.g., Elodea).  Histologically
the cells of the growing point of the adult mutant are no longer
meristematic, but fully grown with large vacuoles.  Apparently in the
mutant the speed of the celluar differentiation relative to the
division frequency is accelerated to such an extent, that a precocious
termination of growth does result in the mutant.<p>

In the following two mutants a gene dependent functional change in
flower development results in a shift of the sexual dioecy to the
female and male side respectively.<p>

Mutant 8/76: The growth of rosettes is rather delayed, the plants
remain smaller, the inflorescence low, but extensively branched and
bushy.  The first flowers look normal, only dropping their sepals and
petals at an early blossoming stage.  The terminal flower, however,
consists of totally effeminated organs only (Fig. 1b and one flower
dissected in Fig. 2) In every whorl each leaf shows a papillose stigma
and a carpel-like rolling.  Sometimes the margin of even anthers or
petals form small white ovules.  But these as well as those in the
medium, morphologically normal pistils are not apt for fertilization.
Similarly the lower pods on the inflorescence do not yield any vital
seed.<p>

Mutant 16/31: Here the sex determination of flowers is shifted towards
maleness.  Rosettes and inflorescences are hardly inhibited, and
sepals, stamens and carpels exhibit no peculiarities in structure.
The sepals only are staminodially modified.  Their lower part
regularly consists of a stalk, the upper one may be petal like white
or outward more or less identical with an another.  Histologically
there is no archespore, but only mesophyll.  The pollen of the normal
stames are fertile.  But even with additional pollination no fertile
seeds were received, though the pods nearly reach normal size.<p>
