Postdoctoral position: Small RNA-mediated gene regulation in plant immunity

A postdoctoral researcher position is available to study the function and 
regulatory mechanism of pathogen-induced small RNAs in plant immunity. 
Endogenous small RNAs have emerged as important players in gene expression 
reprogramming during disease responses. The candidate will focus on the 
identification of pathogen-regulated small RNAs at the genome level. The 
functions of selected small RNAs and small RNA targets will be characterized by 
molecular, genetics and biochemical approaches. Applicants should have a Ph.D 
degree and a strong background in molecular genetics, biochemistry and 
bioinformatics. Experience in microarray and deep parallel sequencing analysis 
is highly desirable.  We are part of the Center for Plant Cell Biology (CEPCEB), 
Institute for Integrative Genome Biology that equipped with state of art 
genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics facilities.
