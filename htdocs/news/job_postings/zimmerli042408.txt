Postdoctoral Position, Arabidopsis, Priming, National Taiwan University. 
 
1) A postdoctoral position is available in Laurent Zimmerli?s lab at the National Taiwan 
University in Taipei. We are interested in Arabidopsis stress perception. The chemical 
beta amino-butyric acid (BABA) enhances Arabidopsis stress resistance by potentiating 
plant defense mechanisms, a still poorly understood phenomenon called ?priming?. 
BABA-priming is a general mechanism (i.e. observed during the response to unrelated 
stresses). The research will focus on the characterization of the function of newly 
discovered genes involved in BABA-priming. The candidate should have a good 
understanding of plant stress biology and particularly, plant-microbe interactions. 
Candidates with strong skills in Arabidopsis molecular genetics are preferred. Proven 
ability to write scientific papers is desirable. Chinese language skills are not required and 
international scientists are encouraged to apply. 
 
The National Taiwan University is the most renowned university in Taiwan and provides 
excellent conditions for research. This university is located in Taipei, a vibrant and 
amazing city.
