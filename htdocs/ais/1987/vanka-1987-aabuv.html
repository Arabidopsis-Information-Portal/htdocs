INTRODUCTION<p>

All eukaryotic cells contain a class of small RNAs (known as U SnRNAs)
localized in the nucleus. These RNAs are part of the ribonucleoprotein
particles (U SnRNPs) which are involved in various aspects of RNA
processing (reviewed by Busch et al., 1982). The demonstration that
U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 RNAs are required for pre-mRNA splicing in
mammalian cells generated much interest in the structure and function
of these RNA molecules and respective SnRNP particles. It has been
shown recently that U1, U5, and U2 SnRNPs participate in the
recognition of the 5' splice site, the 3' splice site and the branch
point region, respectively during mammalian pre-MRNA splicing (for
review see Sharp, 1987; Maniatis and Reed, 1987).<p>

The synthesis of U SnRNAs is also of considerable interest. In
vertebrate cells all U RNAs (with the exception of U6) appear to be
transcribed by RNA polymerase II; their transcription is sensitive to
*alpha*-amanitin and the primary transcripts contain an m 7 G cap
(although this is further methylated in the cytoplasm to produce a
trimethylguanosine structure (Mattaj, 1986). However, the
transcription signals within SnRNA genes in vertebrates differ
substantially from the signals in protein--coding genes and it is
possible that SnRNA genes are transcribed by a specialized
transcription complex or a subclass of RNA polymerase II. (Hernandez
and Weiner, 1986; Neuman de Vegvar et al., 1986 and refs. therein).<p>

Since only limited information about the structure and function of
plant SnRNAs is available (Krol et al., 1983; Kiss et al., 1985 and
1987; Skuzeski and Jendrisak, 1985) and nothing is known about the
structure and transcription of their genes, we have undertaken the
studies reported below.<p>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<p>

U2 and U5 genes were isolated from a genomic DNA library (in the
EMBL-3 *lambda* vector) of Arabidopsis thaliana (Be-O Bensheim strain,
obtained from Dr. I. Negrutiu, Brussels, Belgium). A Xenopus U2 RNA
gene (Mattaj and Zeller, 1983) probe was used to isolate U2 genes. A
p*Cp-labeled Arabidopsis U5 RNA was used as a probe for the isolation
of the U5 gene. Details of the cloning and sequencing procedures and
the expression of these genes in electrophorated protoplasts of
Orychophragmus violaceus and Nicotiana tabacum are described elsewhere
(Vankan and Filipowicz, 1987).<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

Six distinct genes coding for the U2 RNAs in A. thaliana have been
cloned and characterized. In order to define the coding regions of
these genes, the 5' and 3' termini of Arabidopsis U2 RNA were
determined by RNA sequence analysis. Each of these genes codes for an
RNA variation different from the other RNA species by 2-12 point
mutations, localized in the 3' part of the 196-nt-long RNA (Figure 1).
With the exception of a C82-T change in the gene U2.2, the 5'-terminal
101 nucleotide of the coding regions are identical in all genes. This
region, which contains a sequence implicated in base-pairing with the
branch point in pre-mRNA, is also conserved in U2 RNAs isolated from
different (plant and non plant) organisms (Aes, 1986; Kiss et al.,
1987; Reddy, 1986). Interestingly, the U2.2 gene contains a T 105 - C
mutation in the region corresponding to the Sm antigen binding domain
(AUUUUUUA) that is conserved in several different U RNAs (Reddy,
1986).<p>

A secondary structure model of U2 RNA is shown in Figure 2, except for
the U 1 47 - C change in the RNA encoded b the U2.2 gene, the
mutations would preserve the gross secondary structure of U2 RNA; most
of them occur either in the single stranded regions or are immediately
adjacent to the loop.<p>

of the U2.3 RNA is drawn according to the model of Keller and Noon,
1985. Mutations in other cloned U2 snRNA genes are indicated.<p>

Southern blot analysis of Arabidopsis DNA digested with different
restriction enzymes indicated the presence of 10-12 bands that
hybridize to an RNA probe originating from the U2.2 gene. Since each
of the phages characterized by us contains only a single U2 gene, it
appears that the U2 RNA genes of Arabidopsis are not clustered and
their total number corresponds to the number of hybridizing fragments
seen in Southern analysis. It is likely that some of the remaining U2
genes not characterized by us code for still different U2 RNA
variants. It remains to be established whether this variability is of
importance for regulation of mRNA splicing in a developmental or
tissue-specific manner.<p>

The upstream non coding sequences of all six U2 genes are quite
strongly conserved. This region contains three highly conserved
elements: the GTCCCACATCG box (100% conservation, positions -79 to
-68); the TATA homology-containing sequence, GTAGTATAAATA (-37 to
-26), and the cap site-adjacent sequence CAATTC (Figure 3). These
sequences may be of importance for initiation of transcription.
However, they differ from the other promoter elements known to be
important for the transcription of protein coding genes in plants or
SnRNA genes in other organisms. The homology in the 3' non coding
regions is resticted to a stretch of nucleotides (sequence Can
7-9-AGTCAAA), following the 3' end of the coding sequence (Figure 3).
This sequence may function during the 3' end formation; the AGTCAAA is
reminiscent of the sequence ARNYAGA present at the 3' end of the
conserved element important for the termination of transcription of
SnRNA genes in vertebrates and sea urchin (DeLorenzi et al., 1986;
Hernandez and Weiner, 1986; Neuman de Vegvar et al., 1986).<p>

Extensive conservation of the 5' noncoding and the coding regions in
the U2 genes makes it likely that all of them are functional. The
activity of genes U2.2, U2.3 and U2.5 was tested by measuring their
transient expression in protoplasts from tobacco and Orychophragmus
violaceus (a plant belonging to the same family (Cruciferae) as
Arabidopsis). Total protoplast RNA was isolated 24-36 hr after
transfection and analyzed by RNAse A/T1 protection, using
complementary 32 P-labeled RNA probes specific for each gene. Using
the above approach it was possible to demonstrate expression of the
U2.2 and U2.5 genes in Orychophragmus protoplasts, and of the U2.2,
U2.3 and U2.5 genes in tobacco protoplasts. The transiently expressed
U2 RNAs corresponded precisely in length to mature U2 RNA and
contained trimethylguanosine (m3G) caps as established by
precipitability of the RNA with anti-mn3G antibody (Vankan and
Filipowicz, 1987).<p>

The structure of one Arabidopsis gene coding for U2 SnRNA has also
been established. The sequence of its coding region is shown in Figure
4. The RNA coded by this gene can be folded into a 2D structure
similar to the one reported for U5 RNAs from other organisms (Krol et
al., 1983; Reddy, 1986; Peterson and Guthrie, 1987). Interestingly,
the U5 RNA gene contains all of the putative transcription initiation
and termination signals present in U2 RNA genes (Figure 3).<p>

SUMMARY<p>

Six genes encoding U2 SnRNAs and one gene encoding a U5 SnRNA in A.
thaliana have been cloned and characterized. The U2 SnRNA family
consists of about 12 nonclustered genes. Each of the six characterized
genes codes for an RNA variant different from other U2 RNA species by
2-12 point mutations located in the 3' part of the 196-nt-long RNA.
The significance of this variability remains to be established. The
expression of three U2 RNA genes was studied. They are efficiently
transcribed and processed into mature-like RNAs in transfected tobacco
and O. violaceus protoplasts. Transcription initiation and termination
signals were identified upstream and downstream of the coding regions.
These signals are highly conserved between different U2 genes and
between U2 and U5 genes.<p>
