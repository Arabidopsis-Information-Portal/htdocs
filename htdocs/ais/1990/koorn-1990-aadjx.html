ABSTRACT<p>

Mutations resulting in transparent or pale brown seed coats represent
at least 10 different loci, which are named TT. In addition, mutants
at the TT3, TT4, TT5, TT7 and TTG loci are characterized by a reduced
anthocyanine content or a changed anthocyanine composition (TT7).
Seven of the loci have been located on the linkage map and an
indication of their biochemical function is known for three loci.<p>

INTRODUCTION<p>

Wild type Arabidopsis seeds have a characteristic brown colour.
Mutations that result in yellow or pale brown seeds have been
described by BUERGER (1971), KOORNNEEF (1981) and KOORNNEEF et
al.(1982b). This change in seed colour is due to the absence or
changed colour of pigments in the seed coat or testa. The transparency
of the testa reveals the underlying yellow colour of the cotyledons in
the mature embryo and gave the name transparent testa (gene symbol
TT/tt, KOORNNEEF, 1981) to this class of mutants.<p>

The fact that these mutants are seed coat mutants implies that this
characteristic is determined by the maternal genotype in contrast to
Mendel's seed colour genes in pea, which are traits determined by the
embryo genotype. In the case of some mutants there is a change in
testa pigmentation which coincides with a locus specific change in the
anthocyanine content or anthocyanidine composition in the plant
(KOORNNEEF, 1981; KOORNNEEF et al., 1982b).<p>

This report describes the phenotype and genetics of the different tt
mutants.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

Depending on the testa colour and the presence of anthocyanine in the
plants, which shows up well in older leaves and axils, the loci are
subdivided into four phenotypic groups (Table 1.)<p>

Table 1. The phenotype of mutants at the different tt loci.
<pre>
yellow seeds, no anthocyanine                 - tt3, tt4, tt5, ttg*1
yellow seeds, normal anthocyanine             - tt1, tt2, tt8
pale brown/ochre seeds, reduced anthocyanine  - tt6, tt7, ttg*2
pale brown/ochre seeds, normal anthocyanine   - tt9, tt10
</pre><p>

*1 All mutants have no trichomes and an abnormal seed coat
structure. *2 One EMS-induced mutant with reduced trichomes and
reduced anthocyanine content.<p>

Among the mutants raised under our greenhouse conditions a further
subdivision in seed-colour types as described by BUERGER (1971) could
not been made. The variation in testa colour of the mutants may be
affected to some extent by the growing conditions, since it was
noticed that seeds from mutants that were bright yellow in Wageningen
were more brownish when grown in Michigan (R. RASOOLY, pers. comm.).
When seeds are harvested at a relatively immature stage, the seeds
remain somewhat greenish in colour.<p>

All mutants behave as recessives in crosses with wild type and with
mutants at other loci. Complementation analysis revealed that 31
mutants, isolated in mutation experiments at the Department of
Genetics in Wageningen or present in the AIS collection (BUERGER,
1971; KRANZ and KIRCHHEIM, 1987) represent mutations at 10 different
loci, of which 7 have been located at distinct positions on the
linkage map (KOORNNEEF, 1990) (Table 2).<p>

Independent mutants at one locus fall in the same phenotypic class,
with the exception of a mutant with pale brown seeds, which was
allelic with yellow ttg mutants. This EMS-induced mutant is probably
leaky. The other pleiotropic effects typical of the ttg mutants
(KOORNNEEF, 1981) were less obvious in this mutant than in the other
mutants at this locus. Anthocyanine content of the axils and leaves
was reduced, but clearly not completely absent. In addition,
rudimentary trichomes, which are in other ttg mutants, were observed.<p>

different tt loci and their origin.<p>

The absence of both anthocyanines and seed coat pigments in mutants at
specific loci suggests common steps in the biosynthesis of these
compounds.  However, tt mutants with anthocyanine and mutants without
anthocyanine, but with brown seeds have been observed (data not
shown), indicating that parts of these pathways are different.<p>

Since anthocyanine biosynthesis is a topic that has been studied at
the genetic, enzymatic and molecular level in different plant species,
including the crucifer Matthiola incana, some indications about the
gene product of several TT genes can be given.<p>

It has been shown that TT7 controls the enzyme flavonoid
3'-hydroxylase (KOORNNEEF et al., 1982b). The chalcone synthase gene
may be identical to the TT4 locus, since the structural gene involved
has been located on the RFLP map at a very similar position (CHANG et
al., 1988).<p>

The typical combination of pleiotropic effects in the ttg mutants are
not unique to Arabidopsis, since in Matthiola mutations are two
different loci (e and g) have been described that result in the
absence of anthocyanines and a glabrous phenotype (KAPPERT, 1949). As
in Arabidopsis, a mutant allele was known with a 'leaky' phenotype for
all characters involved, which provides a very strong argument that
both characters are controlled by one gene. In Matthiola the
homozygous e and g mutants show no dihydroflavonal 4-reductase
activity (HELLER et al., 1985). That the TTG locus controls a similar
step is also suggested by the presence of the flavonols kaempferol and
quercetin in ttg mutants (data not shown).<p>

Both the collection of more biochemical data and the comparison of the
map position of RFLPs generated by structural genes of the
anthocyanine genes isolated in other plant species with the map
positions of the tt mutants may help to ellucidate the function of the
other TT genes.<p>
