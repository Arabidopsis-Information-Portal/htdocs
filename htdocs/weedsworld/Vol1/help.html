Weeds World is an electronic newsletter which is produced
for the Arabidopsis research community.

This folder contains a plain text version of Vol1 of WeedsWorld. 
We have created a single long file which has the articles carried 
within the newsletter divided by #WeedsWorld# and running back to 
back. You can edit this file to print out a particular article, or 
the whole newsletter can be printed out at once. The files 
themselves are text files and so can be printed out using any 
text software package. 

To print out the images that go with the text it is necessary to 
download these temporarily on to your own computer and then print 
them out and tie them in with the text.

If you want to print out the text and inlined images as seen on 
the World Wide Web you can do this by going to Weeds World at the 
following URLs 

http://nasc.nott.ac.uk:8300/home.html Nottingham, UK
http://weeds.mgh.harvard.edu  MGH, Boston, USA
http://probe.nalusda.gov:8000/index.html NAL, MD, USA

and printing directly from within the client that 
you are using to view the newsletter. This will give you a much 
better finished article, as the text formatting will be retained 
and the images printed in line.

Good luck
