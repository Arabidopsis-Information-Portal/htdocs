INTRODUCTION<p>

In implementing higher plant growth and development under the state of
weightlessness during vegetative and generative phases of ontogenesis,
Tarasenko et al. (1982) and Kordyum et al. (1983a, b) discovered an
unique possibility for studying the structural functional organization
of the gravireceptor, the root cap, which was formed in the
evolutionary processes in the state of absence of the gravity
stimulus. Under the earth conditions it is impossible to remove the
gravity action for any continuous period of time and to observe
simultaneously the plants which are not undergone by gravity. Under
clinostatic condition the plant has no time to perceive a gravity
stimulus, in consequence of which the geotropic reaction cannot
proceed, that is why use of clinostats give a partial opportunity to
reproduce gravitational biological effects.<p>

METHODS<p>

We carried out a comparison of anatomical cytological investigations
of the root cap of Arabidopsis thaliana which is a convenient model
object of the space biological experiments. The plant was cultivated
under stationary conditions on the horizontal clinostat (2 rev/min.)
on board of the scientific orbital station "Salyut-6", and in the
synchronous control. At the laboratory the plants grow in glass
vessels on agar medium (KVITKO, 1960) at continuous light of 8.000 lux
and temperature of 24*degrees*C. On board of the scientific orbital
station and in the synchronous control, plants were cultivated in
"Svetoblok-1" apparatus which provided the growth of Arabidopsis under
sterile conditions at light conditions from 2 to 4 klux. The apparatus
was delivered to "Salyut-6" with Arabidopsis seedlings in the phase of
open cotyledonary leaves. The experiment lasted 65 days. On the first
16 days the plants were illuminated for 14 h. per day, and further on
up to the end of experiment for 24 h.<p>

For the light microscopical investigation Arabidopsis buds, flowers
and pods were fixed by 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution on 0.1M buffer
cacodilat, pH 7.2 during 12 h. with postfixation by 1% OsO 4 solution
during 3h. at room temperature and Navashin mixture
(chron-aceto-formol). Material was dehydrated and paraffined according
to established cytological methods. Microscopic sections were obtained
in 10 micro m on microtome MPS-2, stained with Heidenhein's iron
hematoxylin. For electronmicroscopical investigation after above
mentioned fixation (glutaraldehyde and OsO 4) the apices of main and
lateral roots were dehydrated according to the established method in
ethanol of ascending concentration and in propylenoxid, then enclosed
in epon-araldyt. Sections were made on the ultramicrotome of LKB
system, contrasted then by uranylacetat and lead citrate and
investigated under JEM-100 B electron microscope.<p>

RESULTS<p>

Conducting the investigation of generative organ formation of
Arabidopsis thaliana it was possible to determine that the plants of
the investigated population are not the obligatory selfpollinators
since, along side with hermaphroditic flowers usually of first orders,
potentially dioecious pistillate flowers are also formed. These
flowers differ from hermaphroditic ones in appearance; at the onset of
flowering, in the hermaphroditic flowers the sepal length is not more
than 1/3 of the length of the white petals that remain closed during
another cracking which provides the contact of long stamen broken
pollen with stigma, thus realizing self-pollination. In potentially
dioecious pistillate flowers the petals are not higher or
insignificantly higher than sepals, so that the perianth surrounds not
more than 2/3 of the pistil (this species has a superior ovary). Owing
to this, cross-pollination under natural conditions is possible. The
authors performed an artificial pollination of these flowers with
pollen of other plants which resulted in formation of of siliques with
completely functional seeds; the plants grown from them were fertile.
The obtained data give grounds to state that the Arabidopsis
population of this study is represented by a gynomonoecious sex form.<p>

Phenological observations showed that under clinostat conditions a
certain distinction in approaching successive stages of plant
development took place. Up to the end of the space biological
experiment, experimental and control plants were at the same stages of
development, i.e., flowering and the beginning of fruiting. On an
average the plants were not differing in stem length, bud flowers and
pod quantities. Generative phase distinction was conditioned by
lacking sufficicient light intensity. Arabidopsis is a long day plant;
its ontogenesis is completed up to 40 days at 10 klux light intensity
and 16 h day length.<p>

A comparative anatomical cytological investigation of Arabidopsis
under stationary growth conditions on clinostate, under space flight
conditions, and in synchronic control showed that root cap formation
was the same in all variants; no essential changes in mitosis and
cytokinetic processes of root cap meristematic cells were noticed.
Arabidopsis root cap, like other dicotyledoneous plants originated
from an embryonal layer which belongs to the epidermic one (Danilova,
1974), (dermatocalyptrogene) and it is joined with the root meristem
in the processes of development. In the root cap columella central
statenchyma cells (statocytes) and peripheral secretory cells are
distinguished. The intermediate zone of differentiating cells are
between the root cap meristem and the statenchyma.<p>

Figure 1: Cells and fragments of root cap cells of Arabidopsis
thaliana on the different stages of ontogenesis under control and
microgravity conditions.<p>

At stationary growth conditions the main root length varied from 4 to
6 cm at the rosette stage; the root thickness at the one-layer root
cap level is 0.6 mm on an average. The root cap cell quantity varies
from 30 to 48 at the longitudinal median section. Columella is
represented by 6 cell rows on average; the meristem zone consists of
two cell rows. Below to the meristem cells of the apex a third row of
differentiating cells is situated; the fourth and fifth rows consist
of central statenchyma cells and the 6th one is secretory cells. Being
not large in size the Arabidopsis root cap is a convenient object for
an electron-microscopical investigation. The ultrastructural
organization of the meristem and the differentiating cells are similar
to described ones in literature for other angiospermous plants
(Juniper and Clowes, 1965; Kadey and Kadey, 1970; Danilova, 1974).<p>

In longitudinal sections the central statenchyma cells have 120 micro
m length and 90 micro m width. The cell nucleus is situated in its
proximal and, large amyloplasts in its distal end. Amyloplast stroma
is electron-dense; numerous starch grains occupy the basic volume; the
plastids are close to one another (Fig. 1a). The granular endoplasmic
reticulum is represented by separate cisterns, situated along the cell
membrane. Vacuolar apparatus is poorly developed.<p>

It must be noted that in some root caps the plastids of central
statenchyma cells had a light stroma containing only small starch
grains and did not settle the distal end. The ultrastructure of
secretory cells varied slightly in different root caps. The
distinctions composed in a degree of hypertrophy of dictyosome
cisterns, and in the appearance of electron-dense depositions on the
cells membrane components as well. In the last case it was not found
any large vacuole and hypertropy of Golgi apparatus in the cells;
organelle's destruction was noted. Characteristic feature of the
Arabidopsis root cap is like in other crucifer species (Danilova,
1974), the presence of broadened cisterns of granular endoplasmic
reticulum with a small-granulated content. The cisterns were observed
in the central statenchyma cells (Figure 1c), but more developed in
secretory cells where they reached 10 micro m length and 0.6 micro m
width.<p>

In the process of root ontogenesis cap size decrease may occur owing
to the shelling of distal peripheral cells. In the phase of flowering
discontinuance the degree of progressive cell vacuolization of the
main root cap varied in different plants. In some roots an intensive
vacuolization was a characteristic feature only for secretory and
distal cells of the central statenchyma, in another one cap cells were
highly vacuolized; the cytoplasm of these cells was preserved only in
the form of a peripheral layer.<p>

Under clinostatic conditions the most pronounced changes in the
structural functional organization of the root cap during rosette
phase applied to the amyloplasts structure and their topography in the
central statenchyma cells (Figure 1b). Amyloplasts were situated in
the whole cytoplasm volume.<p>

The starch grain freely placed in the stroma of the plastids decreased
in volume. Under clinosatic conditions the central statenchyma cells
were more vacuolized in comparison to the stationary control.<p>

The appearance of membrane-bound electron-dense depositions on the
cell membrane components in separate root cap must be noted. When it
was observed only in the secretory cells under control conditions
(Figure 1d), then under clinostatic conditions they were revealed in
the cells of all root cap zones during discontinuance of flowering.
These depositions have achieved a maximum in the secretory cells
(Figure 1r). In the cells with electron-dense depositions a partial
organelle destruction occurred; it was expressed in the breaking of
intact membrane of amyloplats, mitochondria, nuclei and of plasmalemma
as well. The more progressive character of the membrane destruction
was noted in the peripheral cells of the root cap. It should be marked
that large vacuoles were not revealed in the secretory cells and in
the cells of central statenchyma of these roots. As a result of the
section treatment with EDTA and EGTA chelators, the sites of
electron-dense substance became transparent, thus their calcium nature
is assumed.<p>

The plants which were growing under spaceflight conditions and
synchronous control being in the flowering phase and outset of
fruiting until the end of the experiment, had high vacuolized cells in
all the zones of the cap of the main root. The lateral root caps which
consist of identical number of cells, were selected for a comparative
analysis. Plastids in the central statenchyma cells of the space
flight variant were dispersed over the whole cytoplasm volume and
contained only small starch grains or the grains were absent.<p>

The content of the vacuoles varied more in comparison with the
synchronous control (Figure 1 f-h). Vacuoles with deposits of
electron-dense amorphic substance, vacuoles with less electron-dense
content, autophagous vacuoles with remains of mitochondria and of
amyloplasts with small starch grains, of hyaloplasm and of membrane
conglomerates were observed.<p>

In the vacuolized central statenchyma cells and the secretory cells of
the root caps of space flight variant in comparison with synchronous
control, the number of broadened cisterms of the granular endoplasmic
reticulum was decreased significantly. Their size decreased up to 1
micro m on the long axis also. Local disturbance of the tonoplast and
the lysis in cell wall zones were identified (Figure 1i).<p>

CONCLUSION<p>

Analysis of the data obtained and study of the literature (Hensel and
Sievers, 1980; Sytnik, 1982) showed that the absence of amyloplast's
settlement which occurred along the whole cytoplasm volume in the
central statenchyma cells of the root cap, and the decrease of the
starch grain volume under microgravity and weightlessness are
regulators for higher plant growth. To our opinon, the above mentioned
peculiarities of the plastidal topography confirm the starch
statolithic hypothesis of Nemec and Haberlandt on the gravity stimulus
perception, because amyloplasts did not settle in the distal parts of
the cells under such conditions. The topography of other organelles of
the central statenchyma cells did not change. Consequently, the
absence of the gravity stimulus, i.e., a weightlessness, or the
impossibility of its perception, i.e., clinostatic conditions,
resulted in the fact that gravity-receiving system did not function.
During the long plant growth under microgravity and weightlessness the
starch grain volume became smaller and the plastidal stroma became
lighter.<p>

The normal arrangement of plant organs in space under weightlessness
as governed probably by the fact that the impossibility to realize a
geotropic reaction is compensated by photo-and chemotropism. This
phenomenon opens new interesting possiblities for studying plant
tropism in the state of weightlessness, i.e., now it is possible to
study the pure influence of each factor exactly. It must be noted here
that the investigation showed an inadequacy of the clinostat and
weightlessness effects at the subcellular level.<p>

As it was mentioned above, in the stationary control analogous changes
of the plastid structure of the central statenchyma cells were
observed in rare cases when the plastids are distributed in the whole
cytoplasm volume and are not settled at the distal end of the cell.
Here, like under experimental conditions, the gravity-receiving
functional organization of the root cap cells is being outset.
According to Hensel and Iversen (1980) under the clinostatic
conditions the ethylene production by the plants is increased. The
enthylene decreases the phospholypid level exchange which results in
changing membrane permeability and release of hydrolytic enzymes, and
at last the intensivity of the autolytic processes of the cytoplasm.
Taking into account the definitive clinostatic and weightlessness
effects at the structural level, an analogous mechanism of the
strengthened cell vacuolization under weightlessness may be assumed.<p>

Autophagous processes are intensified under microgravity and
especially weightlessness which supposes the accelerated of
development or aging at the cellular and subcellular levels on the one
hand and it reflects the cell metabolic changes on the other hand.
Space flight induces alteration in the carbohydrate and lipid
metabolism, an increase or a decrease in the content of hormones and
in the activity of some enzymes. Modern ideas about weightlessness
action on living systems and the possiblity of the space biological
experiments performed with higher plants have opened interesting
perspectives for the solution of a fundamental problem, i.e, the role
of gravity in the evolution and vital activity of plant organisms, and
the use of a new weightlessness factor for the further study of plant
growth regulators at the cellular and subcellular levels, as well.<p>

SUMMARY<p>

The data obtained testifies the formation and the histological zones
of the root caps at the embryonic main roots and the lateral ones
under long duration microgravity and the weightlessness. The
initiation of lateral roots occured during plants ontogenesis under
these conditions. Disturbances of mitosis and cytokinesis in root cap
meristem were not marked.<p>

Significant differences were obtained in the change of cell
compartment's topography and the plastidal structure of the central
statenchyma cells, and in the degree of vacuolization of all the root
cap zones.<p>

Arabidopsis thaliana is a suitable model object, as it was shown in
our investigation, for studying the structural, functional
organization and differentiation of root apex cells in the vegetative
and the generative phases of plant ontogenesis in space biological
experiments.<p>
