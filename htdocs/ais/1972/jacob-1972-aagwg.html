The purpose of this work was to establish the genetic relationships
between the different acid phosphatase and leucine aminopeptidase
isozymes observed in Arabidopsis<p>

1.  Acid phosphatase (AP)<p>

Preliminary investigations have shown the occurrence of three main
types of AP electrophoretic patterns (JACOBS, 1971).  Using similar
technical procedures we have accomplished a more extensive review of
the existing polymorphism.  Each of the tested 36 geographical races
corresponds to one of the 3 types previously defined as fast (F),
intermediate (I) or slow (S) (Table 1).<p>

electrophoretic pattern<p>

Crosses between these different types have been made and the analysis
of F2 progenies is given in Table 2.  These results are consistent
with the hypothesis that the phenotypic differences are controlled by
three alleles of a single gene Ap1, each specifying a set of isozymes
with different rates of anodal migration in electrophoresis at pH 8.3.
The third band of each set is the most intense.  A certain number of
isozymes belonging to different series were found to correspond in
migration rates.  In heterozygottes, the enzyme types specified by
each allele migrate to the same positions as in the respective
homozygotes.  There is no evidence for the formation of hybrid enzymes
(Fig. 1).  The observed variation between the three AP patterns
results thus from the action of three alleles of Ap1 gene that are
expressed without dominance.<p>

This investigation will be followed by further research on the nature
of the differences between isozymes of one electrophoretic set
controlled by one Ap1 allele and on the nature of the genetic control
of their activity.<p>

2.  Leucine aminopeptidase (LAP)<p>

LAP zymograms show two main zones of activity (F and S bands) and
among 48 tested races, only one variant with a slower migration of the
more anodal band has been found in the races An, En-1 and Sa
(Sacaven).  There is no evidence for the formation of hybrid enzymes
in heterozygotes.  In back crosses between F1 hybrids and parental
races, approximately half of the offspring showed the parental type
and half the hybrid type.  In the F2 generation, the three phenotypes
were represented in proportions which fit a 1:2:1 segregation (Table
3).<p>

Table 3: Phenotypes obtained in progeny of self-fertilizations and of
crosses made to determine the genetic basis of leucine aminopeptidase
(LAP) variation<p>

We can conclude that the two fast LAP isozymes are controlled by a
single gene locus with two codominant alleles. This locus can be named
Lap1 with the two alleles as Lap1 and Lap1.<p>
