FOUR POSTDOCTORAL POSITIONS AND TWO PhD POSITIONS for work on 
PLANT-SPIDER MITE INTERACTION are available beginning September 1, 2009, in 
the labs of Miodrag and Vojislava Grbic at the Dept. of Biology, The University of 
Western Ontario, Canada (http://www.uwo.ca/). 

A joint multidisciplinary effort funded by Genome Canada that combines genomics, 
bioinformatics, genetics, biochemistry, population biology, plant biotechnology and plant 
breeding will open new opportunities to dissect interactions between plants and 
herbivores on the whole genome level.

This work builds on the whole genome sequencing project of the spider mite Tetranychus 
urticae (JGI: http://www.jgi.doe.gov/sequencing/why/50028.html) and is part of the 
international collaboration with the groups of Prof. Yves Van de Peer (VIB, Flanders 
Institute for Biotechnology, Gent, Belgium), Prof. Maria Navajas (INRA, Montpellier, 
France), and Prof. Isabel Diaz and Dr Félix Ortego (CSIC, Institute and Universidad 
Politécnica de Madrid, Spain), Prof. José Miguel Martínez-Zapater (CNB, Madrid, Spain) 
and Prof. Richard Clark (University of Utah, USA) (OGI: 
http://www.ontariogenomics.ca/research/project/334).

Strongly motivated candidates with demonstrated expertise in genetics, molecular 
biology, bioinformatics, genomics and/or plant-pest interactions, who are willing to be 
engaged in international collaboration, are encouraged to apply. Funding for this position 
is secured for four years. 

Please forward applications including a curriculum vitae and contact information of two 
senior scientist referees by e-mail to vgrbic@uwo.ca. Please, put “Genome Canada-
funded positions” in the subject line.
