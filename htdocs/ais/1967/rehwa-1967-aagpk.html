	In any partially after-ripened seed population there exists a wide range in the degree of dormancy as exhibited by individual seeds.  If this reflects genetic variation, rapid initial changes in the dormancy level under high selection pressure are expected.  The experiments reported here were conducted to test the effects of selection for dormancy on one line of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) HEYNH.<p>

	Selection for high and low dormancy were carried out on germinating seed populations for three successive generations on the basis of the first and last 3 to 5 seeds to germinate in a sample of 200 or more seeds. The first selection was conducted on seed harvested from a single plant of a line (race Landsberg) obtained from Dr. G. P. REDEI, Columbia, Missouri.  There was no control of light during the selection process. All plants were grown at 24*degrees*C, 55% relative humidity, and in a 20 hr light period of 1500 ft-c white fluorescent light.  Following selection, the germinabiities of the low dormancy (LD3) and the high dormancy (HD3) lines were compared by dark germination tests (REHWALDT, 1965) on seeds of three plants of both lines.  Two seed harvests provided two replicates.  In a second experiment, self-pollinations and reciprocal cross-pollinations were carried out between plants of the LD3 and HD3 lines.  The same plant was used as the maternal and pollen parent for each cross. This was replicated four times.  The significance of the differences was determined by an F test based upon arc sin transformed values.<p>

	The average germination of the LD3 line and the HD3 line was 90.1% and 88.,6% respectively (Table 1).  The small difference follows the expected pattern but is not significant.  In the second experiment, the average germination for seeds from the LD3 plants when self-pollinated and when cross-pollinated with HD3 was 81.3% respectively, while that of the HD3 line was 61.4% and 68.9% (Table 2).  Though germinability appears to follow the expected pattern resulting from selection for dormancy with possible maternal transmission, the differences are not significant at the 5% level.<p>

	DOXTATOR and FINKNER (1958) and SNYDER (1953) in studies of Beta vulgaris, a cross-pollinating species, found small changes in the speed of germination following selection. Selection for dormancy may be even less effective for self-pollinating species which tend to be highly homozygous.  The data reported here indicate that the experimental material was highly homozygous or that heritability for dormancy is relatively low.<p>
