FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS OF MAIZE GAMETOPHYTES

A postdoctoral position is available starting immediately to study the functional genomics 
of maize gametophyte development.  The successful applicant will join an NSF Plant 
Genome Research Program-funded collaboration between the Carnegie Institution, 
Oregon State University, Iowa State University, South Dakota State University, and 
Stanford University.  The project uses molecular, genetic, and bioinformatic tools to 
identify genes required for gametophyte development and function in maize. A Ph.D. in 
molecular biology, genetics, or a related field is required.  A strong background in 
genetics and molecular biology is desired.  Experience in maize genetics is advantageous 
but not required.  Excellent communication skills and an ability and willingness to 
collaborate are essential.  The successful applicant is also expected to interact with 
undergraduates participating in the project through the Stanford Science in Service 
Program. 
 
Interested individuals should send an application package through e-mail (a 
cover letter detailing experience; CV; publication reprints; and names, 
telephone numbers and e-mail addresses of three references) to Matt Evans, Carnegie 
Institution for Science, Department of Plant Biology, 260 Panama St., Stanford, CA
