The measuring of the frequency of outcrossing in self-pollinating
species was very often studied in the last years, mainly in connection
with the solution of the problem of the genetic structure of
populations. It was found that a certain low percentage of outcrossing
occurs in any species held for autogamous, and that is why these
species are called "predominantly autogamous species". Allard, Jain
and Workman (1968) found in Hordeum sativum and Triticum aestivum
about 1 to 2 percent of outcrossing, in Phaeolus lunatus 3 to 5
percent and in Avena factua even about 10 percent of outcrossing. Also
in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. The frequency of spontaneous
outcrossing was accurately determined in artificial populations
carrying recessive markers. Robbelen (1971) found that the frequency
of standard phenotypes in the progenies of recessives was about 1.1
percent. Lawrence and Snape (1971) came to a similar value when
cultivating plants in sheltered conditions. In the part of material
cultivated in less sheltered conditions the frquency of outcrossing
was about 2.1 percent. Cetl and Plchova (1975) and Cetl (1976) tried
to clarify their presumption that the cuasal mechanisms of outcrossing
may be the contact between adjacent inflorescences caused by wind
movement. In the progenies of two recessive mutants sown in
alternative rows they searched for complementing standard individuals
and found that in the sample of about 1.000 plants of both genotypes
2.15 percent of spontaneous outcrossing took place. In conditions
favouring crossfertilization by means of artificial motion of
flowering plants the percentage of outcrossing increased up to 4.46
percent. These experiments also showed the considerable differences
between the two mutants. While in one direction of possible crossing
no hybrids arose, in reciprocal direction their frequency was
relatively high (5.6 p.c. vs. 9.9 p.c. respectively).<p>

In our experiments attention was given to the cases of the variability
of spontaneous outcrossing in total due to the genotypical
differences. Four different recessive mutant lines, derived from the
S96 line, were studied in the experiment: rotundata (2) - re(2),
robusta (S) - rb(S), angustifolia (S) - an (S), and chlorominuta - chm
3 (see Relichova, 1976). Six different double combinations were sown
at the distance 2.5 x 2.5 cm in two different ways of spacing: (i) the
two recessive mutants were sown in alternating rows; (ii) the two
mutants were sown like a chessboard. The plants were grown in
artificial laboratory conditions at 25 +/- 3*degrees*C and
illumination of 1950 lux for 12 hours per day. In each combination
there were 140 plants.<p>

The beginning of flowering of individual genotypes was recorded. No
motion with flowering plants was done. Plants of individual genotypes
were harvested during 14 days from the harvesting of the first mature
pod. In the progenies of individual genotypes the complementing
standard plants were counted, i.e. the cross-fertilized plants.<p>

This experiment enables us to make conclusions not only about the
genotypically determined differences in the frequency of outcrossing,
but also about other effective factors. The results of the experiment
are given in the following table:<p>

Table 1:<p>

The results show that the mean frequency of outcrossing in the whole
experiment was very low (.12 p.c.). Concerning the frequency of cross
fertilization in individual genotypes the differences are significant.
The highest percentage of outcrossing was in the mutant rb (S) (.21
p.c.), then afterwards chm 3 (.17), rd (2) (.07) and finally the
lowest figure was in an (S) (.02).<p>

As regards the frequency of outcrossing in individual combinations
also differences occurred. The highest values were found in
combination rb(S) + chm3 (.25 p.c.), then in an(S) + chm3, an(S) +
rb(S) and rd(2) + rb(S) (.13, .12, .11 p.c., respectively), and the
lowest figures in chm 3 + red(2) (.08 p.c.) and an (S) + re(2) (.05
p.c.). A considerable influence on the frequency of spontaneous
crossfertilization is attributed to the way of spacing. While in the
sowing in rows there were .07 p.c. of outcrossing, in the "chessboard"
sowing .18 p.c. If the above values given were transformed to those
giving the proportion of a random outcrossing (a) (Allard, Jain and
Workman, 1968), then the proportion of newly arisen heterozygotes
should have to be divided by gene frequency. At p = q in particular
combinations of our experiment, the figures should be divided by .5.<p>

The genotypic differences in the extent of outcrossing found in our
experiment should be considered in connection with the whole
phenotype, e.g., the time of flowering, the habit of the plant, etc.
The mutants used did not practically differ in vigour, fertility and
height of the flower stem. Only mutant rb(S) showed more branching in
the inflorescences. Also the differences in the time of flowering,
although they comprised only a few days, could at some influence here,
e.g. the mutant chm2 and rb(s) were in average slightly later, that is
why it might have more chance to be fertilized with other earlier
genotypes. Nevertheless, we assume that the slightly different time of
flowering in some combinations was not the conclusive factor in the
extent of outcrossing since e.g., the combination an(S) + rd(2) with
nearly synchronous flowering has the lowest percent of outcrossing.<p>

Our experiment has shown that one of the factors responsible for the
differences in the spontaneous outcrossing in Arabidopsis thaliana is
in agreement with other authors, the close of mutual contact of
plants. Next to this we have found that a further improtant factor for
a spontaneous outcrossing is also the genotype of the plant.<p>
