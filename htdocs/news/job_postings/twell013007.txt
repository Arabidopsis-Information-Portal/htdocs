Mechanisms of cytokinesis and reproductive development in plants: dissecting
the activities of the FUSED-related TWO-IN-ONE protein
 
Applications are invited for a 3-year BBSRC-funded postdoctoral position to
investigate the mechanism of action of the Arabidopsis TWO-IN-ONE protein
kinase that is required for cell division in reproductive and vegetative
cell development (Oh, S-A. et al., (2006) A divergent cellular role for the
FUSED kinase family in the plant-specific cytokinetic phragmoplast. Curr.
Biol. 15, 2107-2111).

Applicants should have a PhD in molecular genetics, biochemistry or a
related discipline. Experience in molecular techniques involved in protein
interactions and cell imaging would be of particular value. The project
offers the opportunity to join an active research group working on the
mechanisms regulating cell division and cell fate determination during male
reproductive development in Arabidopsis.
