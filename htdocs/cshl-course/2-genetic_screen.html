1.  Overview

<P>
Experiments : 1.  Crossing Arabidopsis
<P>
   2.  Staining pollen tubes
<P>
   3.  Staining pollen for GUS
activity<BR>
<BR>

<P>
 The goal of this lab is to demonstrate
basic techniques used in crossing <I>Arabidopsis thaliana</I>,
as well as techniques for assessing the viability and fertility
of pollen.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
Schedule: Experiments 2 and 3
may require 1 - 2 hours.  You may wish to initiate those experiments
and then to cross your plants during the incubation steps or while
waiting to use the microscopes or other equipment.<BR>

<P>
<B>2.  <B>EXPERIMENT #1:  CROSSES
WITH ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA</B></B>
<P>
 Crosses with Arabidopsis can
be quite challenging due to the small size of the flowers.  The
instructors will demonstrate methods for removing anthers and
pollinating stigmas.  The techniques require patience and practice,
but after some experience, crosses require only 1-3 minutes each.
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
Cross the following plants:<BR>

<P>
 1)  Female: albino 1/+  heterozygotes
<P>
  Male:  Landsberg erecta<BR>

<P>
 2) Female: male-sterile ms1/ms1
mutants
<P>
  Male:  Landsberg erecta<BR>
<BR>

<P>
 The albino 1 mutation is a recessive
embryonic or seedling lethal and must be maintained by propagating
heterozygotes.  When albino1/+ plants are selfed, the developing
siliques segregate 3:1 for wild-type : white (dead) seeds.  If
you have successfully crossed wild-type pollen onto the albino1/+
plant, you will be able to see (before the end of the course)
few, if any, dead seeds.
<P>
 Crossing onto a male-sterile
line can be extremely convenient, minimizing the work required
for emasculation.  The ms1 mutation is recessive and has a severe
defect in pollen development (seed kindly donated by M. Koornneef).
 Within 3-6 days after a successful cross, you will see seed pod
expansion, and, if you remove the epidermal layer of the pistil,
you will be able to see the developing seeds.  Fully fertilized
seed pods will contain approximately 60 seeds.<BR>

<P>
<B>3.  <B>EXPERIMENT #2:  STAINING
POLLEN TUBES</B></B>
<P>
 A useful method for monitoring
pollen fertility is to stain and visualize pollen tubes as they
grow on the stigma and through the transmitting tract.  In this
experiment we will observe the growth of pollen tubes on self-pollinated
wild-type plants.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
1. Remove open flowers from wild-type
plants.  Newly pollinated flowers are best to use, but you can
also look at flowers with elongating siliques.  Before placing
the pistils in fixative, remove the petals, and (if you wish)
the anthers, as these will often obscure the view of the pistil.
<BR>

<P>
2. Fix the pistils for at least
1.5 hours (can go overnight) in 1 ml of:<BR>

<P>
   10% acetic acid
<P>
   30% chloroform
<P>
   60% ethanol<BR>

<P>
3. Pipet off fixative and suspend
in 1 ml 4N NaOH for 10 min.<BR>

<P>
4. Neutralize with 3 washes of
50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5).<BR>

<P>
5. Move pistils to a slide and
add a drop of 0.05% aniline blue in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH
7.5)  Gently apply a cover slip and view pollen tubes on the fluorescent
microscope (use the DAPI filter).  To see the tubes on the interior
of the pistil, you will need to squash the tissue firmly with
the cover slip.  With this stain, pollen grains (but not pollen
tubes) also can be visualized with the rhodamine filter.<BR>

<P>
<B>4.  <B>EXPERIMENT #3:  STAINING
POLLEN FOR GUS ACTIVITY</B></B>
<P>
<B>4.1  Introduction</B>
<P>
 A useful method for studying
pollen gene expression is to analyze the levels of a reporter
enzyme such as &szlig;-glucuronidase (GUS) under the control of
a promoter of interest.  Here we present a simple method for examining
GUS expression in pollen.
<P>
 Transgenic plants that contain
a fusion of the LAT52 promoter (Twell, et al., 1989, Mol. Gen.
Genet. 217: 240; and Twell et al., 1990, Development 109: 705)
to &szlig;-glucuronidase will be provided.  The LAT52 promoter
is a well-characterized pollen-specific promoter from tomato that
is active in many plant species, including Arabidopsis.  Because
transcription from this promoter occurs only after meiosis, plants
heterozygous for a LAT52-GUS transgene will produce both GUS-positive
and GUS-negative pollen grains in a 1:1 ratio.
<P>
 The transgenic plants also contain
a mutation in the <I>quartet1</I> gene (<I>qrt1</I>, Preuss et
al., 1994, Science, 264:1458-1460).  This mutation causes the
four products of pollen meiosis to be released in an intact tetrad,
rather than as individual pollen grains.  Thus, in the <I>qrt1</I>
background, plants heterozygous for the GUS transgene will produce
pollen tetrads with 2 GUS-positive and  2 GUS-negative pollen
grains.  
<P>
 Inviable pollen grains or pollen
that failed to develop properly will form little GUS protein and
will stain poorly.  Some of the strains provided may have low
pollen viability because they were backcrossed only once following
transformation.  This experiment will demonstrate the effects
of mutagenic procedures, such as transformation, on pollen viability.
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>4.2  Procedure</B>
<P>
1. Place flowers from plants to
be tested in a microfuge tube.<BR>

<P>
2. Cover the flowers with 90%
acetone, and vortex to dislodge the pollen.  Place a drop of the
pollen suspension on a glass slide, and let the solution evaporate
completely at room temperature.  Multiwell slides provide a convenient
means to analyze pollen from several plants on one slide.<BR>

<P>
3. Add a drop of 50 mM sodium
phosphate, pH 7.0, 5 mM potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mM potassium
ferricyanide, 0.5 mg/ml X-gluc (from Clontech) [5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl
glucuronide].  Place slide in a humid chamber (a plastic box with
a lid that contains wet paper towels) and incubate for at 0.5
- 1 hour at 37&#176;C.<BR>

<P>
4. Assess pollen staining in the
light microscope.  Determine whether the plant(s) you scored are
heterozygous or homozygous for the GUS transgene.<BR>
