<h2> Callus growth and differentiation in liquid media</h2><p>

One of the major questions in biology is how cells, tissues, and
organs differentiate.  With the availability of caluls cultures, one
could hope that the problem of vascular tissue differentiation might
be approached quite directly.<p>

The first step would be to obtain undifferentiated cells in callus and
from callus. The second step would be to subject them directly to the
proper conditions, including the proper environmental condition in
order to induce them to differentiate into organs.<p>

The last few months we have attempted with some success to make the
first step.  A small amount of callus (7 mg) obtained from previous
cultures (CORCOS and LEWIS, 1971) was transferred into 2 media and
grown on a horizontal shaker.  The first medium H19, contained Heller
minerals 20 g of dextrose/liter, 90 cc of filtered V-8 juice, 120 cc
of coconut milk, and 3 mg of 2-4D.  The second medium, H20, contained
the same components as H19, but 2-4D was omitted.  In the H19 medium
the callus grew to form rounded nodular, yellow clumps of cells.
These clumps of cells showed little internal differentiation.
Sometimes tracheids were present, but not abundant.  Individual cells
were seen floating in the medium.  The callus grew well and was
subcultured with ease and was stored for a few months in the
refrigerator and remained viable.  In the H20 medium which did not
contain 2-4D, the callus differentiated into root tips with root
hairs. The callus turned brown with age and was tougher.<p>

These experiments indicated that H 19 was a good medium to grow
Arabidopsis callus.  However, this medium contains two complex organic
components, coconut milk and V-8 juice, and this is a drawback to
further exploration.  Replacement of coconut milk by kinetin and V-8
juice by vitamins seemed to be a logic step.  Hence callus and cell
growth experiments were performed in the following media.<p>

1. H19, a control, has been described.<p>

2. H23, in which coconut milk had been replaced by 1 mg/liter of
kinetin.<p>

3. H30, in which coconut milk had been replaced by 1 mg./liter of
kinetin and V-8 juice by 2 mg of glycine, 0.5 mg of niacin, 0.1 mg of
pyridoxin HC1, and 100 mg of inositol.<p>

The H23 medium supported faster growth than did H30 or H19 (Fig 1).
The callus was in the form of nodular clumps of cells.  There were
very few tracheids at first, but they sometimes became more numerous
as the culture aged.<p>

The growth of the callus in H30 medium was less rapid than in the H23,
but faster than in the H19 medium (Fig. 1).  The callus masses were
irregular in shape with irregular growth points.  They contained a
large number of tracheids.  As the culture aged, root primordia
appeared.  The cells had a wider range of shapes from circular to
cubicle, to elongated in parallel groups.<p>

Though the callus can be subcultured easily in the H30 medium, this
medium is not satisfactory as the H23.  More research must be done to
obtain a better synthetic medium.<p>

All these experiments indicated that the presence of 2-4D in the
medium is necessary to keep cells undifferentiated.  ANAND (1966)
reported that "in a medium containing 10E-7M 2-4D and 15% coconut
milk, Arabidopsis callus produced a large number of root primordia
over the entire callus surface.  In the course of two weeks these
primordia grew as roots and after 2 months of growth their length was
increased tremendously".  He added, "This observation is of particular
interest since TORREY and SHIGEMURA (1957) reported previously that
2-4D suppressed organization of roots".  However, TORREY and SHIGEMURA
used 2-4D at 10 times his concentration.  See also STABE and LAMBA
(1963).<p>

We obtained root primordia from callus in H19 medium containing 0.5 mg
of 2-4D instead of 3 mg.  In addition we have been growing callus on
solid media containing any roots.  Hence a high concentration of 2-4D
permits growth but little or no differentiation.<p>
