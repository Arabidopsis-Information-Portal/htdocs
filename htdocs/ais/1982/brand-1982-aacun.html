INTRODUCTION<p>

Chlorate-resistant mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana were isolated and
described by Oostindier-Braaksma and Feenstra (1973, 1974). One of
these mutants (B25) was shown to be virtually devoid of in vitro
nitrate reductase activity and growth experiments with different
nitrogen sources demonstrated that B25 cannot use nitrate as the sole
source of N, but that nitrite or ammonium can replace it. In fact, the
mutant is growing slightly better on these N-sources than the wildtype
plants (Braaksma and Feenstra, 1982).<p>

Mutant B25 is able to take up nitrate and accumulate it to relatively
high concentrations (Doddema et al., 1978). It was also observed that
this mutant grows better on ammoniumnitrate than on ammonium alone.
This was partly explained by the effects of high ammonium
concentrations on the metabolism of the plant (Doddema et al., 1978).
On the other hand, in vivo nitrate reductase determinations showed an
activity in the mutant up to 30% of the activity of the wildytpe
plants, indicating that there might be another reaction involved in
the reduction of nitrate (Braaksma and Feenstra, 1982).<p>

The present paper deals with a study on the uptake and incorporation
of nitrate-N into the organic-N fraction of the mutant B25, using 15
N-labelled nitrate.<p>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<p>

The nitrate reductase-deficient mutant B25 of Arabidopsis thaliana
(L.) Heynh. was isolated (Oostindier-Braaksma and Feenstra, 1973) from
the mutant erecta of the ecotype "Landsberg" (Redei, 1962).<p>

Seeds were surface sterilized and planted in nutrient agar. Plants
were grown on Standard Mineral Medium (Doddema et al., 1978)
containing NH 4 NO 3 and agar. After 15 days they were transferred to
a liquid medium with NH+ 4 as the sole N-source. After another 9 days
the plants received the same mineral medium, but without any N-source
during 2 days. For further details of the growing procedure see:
Doddema et al., (1978)<p>

After growth as mentioned above the first batch of plants (24 plants)
were harvested (number 1).<p>

The other batches were placed on a ten times diluted mineral medium to
which 5 mM K 15 NO 3 (enrichment 48%) was added. After 3.5 days two
batches were harvested with 23 and 25 plants respectively (number 2).<p>

The four remaining batches were placed for an additional day on ten
times diluted mineral medium with 5 mM K 14 NO 3, and then harvested.
They contained 22, 23, 26 and 30 plants respectively (number 3).<p>

After harvesting, the plants were divided into shoots and roots,
homogenized in liquid N2, and after weighing extracted overnight in
distilled water at 4*degrees*C. After centrifugation in a Sorvall
superspeed RC 2B refrigerated centrifuge at 10 000 x g, the extracts
were divided into supernatant, containing the soluble, mainly
inorganic N, and the pellet with the insoluble, organic N.<p>

The soluble fraction was distilled directly with 10 ml 30% (w/v)
FeSO4, 10 ml 0.5% (w/v) Ag 2 SO 4 and 10 ml 50% (w/v) NaOH, during
which the nitrate and nitrite was reduced to ammonium and, together
with the ammonium already there, was distilled as NH 3 and collected
in 10 ml 1/70 N HC 1 plus 10 ml distilled water. After making up the
volume to 50 ml with distilled water the NH + 4 was determined using
the Nessler reagent.<p>

The insoluble fraction was destructed in a Kjeldahl flask containing 3
ml concentrated H 2 SO 4 and some ctalyser mixture (K 2 SO 4, CuSO 4.
2H 20, Se0 2), overnight. The clear destruate was distilled with 10 ml
distilled water and 20 ml 7.5 N NaOH, and collected in 10 ml 1/70 N
HC1 plus 10 ml 7.5 N NaOH, and collected in 10 ml 1/70 N HC1 plus 10
ml distilled water. After making up to 50 ml with distilled water the
NH + 4 was determined using Nessler reagent.<p>

The NH + 4 in the remainder of both fractions was oxidized with
alkaline hypobromite to N 2-gas which was used to fill evacuated glass
emission tubes. The wavelength and intensity of the emitted light was
measured with NOI-3 15 N-analyser connected to a recorder. From the
peaks obtained, indicating the relative amounts of 28 N 2 and 29 N 2
the percentage 15 N enrichment of each of the fractions was calculated
(Faust, 1965).<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

The average results of the identical treatments are shown in Table 1.
The N present in the fractions is expressed as mg NH + 4 per gram
fresh weight of shoots or roots; the enrichment as % 15 N of the total
N per fraction.<p>

Directly after the growth period the soluble N is low, both in the
shoots and in the roots. As can be expected, this fraction increases
markedly when the plants receive nitrate, especially in the shoots. In
the roots the soluble fraction first increases and then decreases
again. The percentage 15 N in the soluble fraction in the shoots
decreases during the day on non-labelled nitrate, whereas this
percentage in the roots goes on inceasing during the same period.
Apparently the stored 15 N in the roots is less well transported up to
the shoot than the newly supplied 14 N. Presumably what is transported
to the shoots is mainly the originally present NH + 4 and the newly
supplied 14 NO 3.<p>

Table 1: Amount of N (as mg NH + 4/g fresh weight) and enrichment with
15 N (as %) in the soluble and insoluble fractions of Arabidopsis
thaliana mutant B25 shoot and root extracts as influenced by the
indicated treatments.<p>

The insoluble N fraction in the shoots increases with time on nitrate
as does the enrichment percentage. The enrichment goes on increasing
even after the plants are transferred to 14 N nitrate. This is
probably caused by a continuing incorporation of 15 N from the soluble
fraction in the shoot. In the root the insoluble fraction becomes
quickly labelled with 15 N, but after replacing the labelled nitrate
by non-labelled nitrate, it also loses the label quickly.<p>

From the fact that not only the soluble fraction shows a label, but
also the insoluble (organic) fraction, it must be concluded that the
mutant B25 apparently can reduce nitrate although it does not show an
appeciable amount of nitrate reductase in vitro (Braaksma and
Feenstra, 1982). Therefore, another (enzymatic?) reaction must be
involved. Peive et al. (1975) showed that the enzyme peroxidase is
able to reduce nitrate in plants and it seems possible that this
enzyme is also responsible for the observed reduction of nitrate in A.
thaliana mutant B25. The affinity for nitrate of the proxidase is low,
but especially in B25 with its capacity to accumulate high amounts of
nitrate, this might be overcome by a high internal concentration.<p>

Evidence for the participation of peroxidase in the reduction of
nitrate in mutant 25 of A. thaliana will be presented elsewhere.<p>

SUMMARY<p>

Arabidopsis thaliana nitrate reductase-deficient mutant B25 was grown
on ammoniumnitrate followed by ammonium as the N-source. After uptake
of K 15 No 3 for 3.5 days and K 14 NO 3 for an additional one day, the
plants were harvested and the nitrogen and percentage 15 N was
determined in the soluble and insoluble fractions of both the shoots
and roots. The nitrate stimulated the transport of the soluble and the
insoluble N from the roots towards the shoots and resulted in an
increased N-incorporation in the shoots. A relatively high enrichment
with 15 N was found in the insoluble organic N fraction, indicating
that the plants are able to reduce nitrate in significant amounts. It
is suggested that another enzyme, probably peroxidase, is responsible
for this reduction.<p>
