A Post-doctoral position immediately available in molecular genetics. 
Creative Research Initiative, Korea University, Seoul, Korea 


A postdoctoral researcher position is available starting immediately to 
study long-distance regulation of flowering time in Arabidopsis at Korea 
University, Seoul, Korea. This is a full-time grant-funded position 
(Creative Research Initiative in Korea). The project will use molecular 
genetic approaches and protein biochemistry of the FT/TFL1 family genes 
in Arabidopsis. A strong background on Arabidopsis flowering genetics 
and protein-protein interaction and previous experience in grafting 
experiments in Arabidopsis are a plus. Successful applicants will be 
expected to show a high degree of research productivity, good 
communication skills (both oral and written), and an ability to work 
collaboratively with other lab members. Starting salary will be 
commensurate with previous experience of the applicant.
