<h2>A P-FLUOROPHENYLALANINE RESISTANT MUTANT IN ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA</h2><p>

Genesius-Rode, Belgium.)<p>

A large number of mutants resistant to various amino acid analgues
have been described in a variety of microorganisms and lower
eukaryotes, but only a few are reported in higher plants (WILDHOLM,
1974, CARLSON, 1973).  Besides their importance as biochemical
markers, the potential interest presented by such mutants derives from
the possible causes for resistance, namely impaired uptake of the
analogue, lack of activation of the analogue by an altered amino acyl
synthetase or loss of the property of the tRNA to charge the analogue,
or modifications in the regulation control which leads to
overproduction of the corresponding amino acid. The last phenomenon
has already been used to stress the potential interest to increase the
amino acid content of certain organs of edible plants (BROCK, 1975)<p>

One of the most exploited amino acid analogue in bacterial systems is
para-fluorophenylalanine (FPhe), an analogue of phenylalanine.
Mutants resistant to growth inhibition of FPhe have been reported in
several species of bacteria and fungi (FANGMAN et al, 1964, HAUNAU
1972, COHEN et al. 1958, BROOKS et al, 1972, PHARES et al, 1975,
RHODES et al, 1975, SINHA 1967).<p>

By plants, the growth inhibitory effects of FPhe have been reported on
haploid and diplid tobacco cells (GUPTA et al, 1972, DIX et al, 1974).
FPhe is very inhibitory for the growth of Arabidopsis thaliana, Wi-2,
which is mediated by the production of abnormal products due to the
incorporation of FPhe into proteins (JAMES 1971).<p>

In the present investigation, an attempt has been made to select
mutants growing in the presence of FPhe to study the genetical and
biochemical aspects of this induced resistance in a higher plant,
Arabidopsis thaliana.<p>

MATRIAL AND METHODS<p>

Growth of Arabidopsis: This work has been performed with the race
Wil-2.  The plants were grown on perlite under aseptic conditions with
continuous illumination (Gro-Lux 9000 lux) at constant humidity (70%)
and temperature (24*degrees*C +/- q.5*degrees*C), on a mineral medium
(JACOBS 1964).<p>

Induction and selection of mutation: A 60 mM ethyl methanesulphonate
solution in Tris-buffer pH 6.5 was used to immerse dry seeds for a
period of 6 hrs. at 25*degrees*C.  After repeated washes, seeds were
directly sown on soil in the greenhouse.  M2 seeds were sown on
perlite supplemented with MM including FPhe at the effective
concentration (1.10E-4M).<p>

Radioisotope uptake and incorporation: Seeds and/or 8-day old
seedlings were incubated in mineral medium with 25 microCi/ml of 14C -
FPhe (50 mCi/mM), or with 10 micro Ci/ml of 14C-Phe (50 mCi/mM) or
with 25 micro Ci/ml of 3H-leucine (15.8 Ci/mM).  Lots of 100 seeds or
the root system of 10 seedlings were immersed in the incubation
mixture and recovered at different intervals after incubation. After
washing, first in equimolar solutions of the corresponding unlabelled
compounds and then with distilled water, the samples were immediately,
frozen and then stored at 0*degrees*C.<p>

Samples were homogenised in Potter homogeniser into 5,5% TCA at
0*degrees*C. After 30 min. the homogenate was centrifuged at 10000 rpm
for 5 min at 0*degrees*C. The supernatant is the acido-soluble (AS)
fraction.  The sediment is resuspended in 3 ml of 5.5% TCA, filtered
on a Millipore filter (HWAP) and washed twice with the same acid
solution. The filter is then dried at 30 *degrees*C for three hours.
It contains the acido-insoluble fractions (AIS).<p>

For the extraction of proteins, the same procedure is applied except
that the sediment is suspended in 1 N NaOH for 16 hours at
37*degrees*C, centrifuged at 15.000 rpm for 5 min. and the resulting
pellet is washed again with 1 N NaOH followed by centrifugation as
before. The last two supernatants constitute the protein fractions.<p>

Radioactivity was measured in a Tri-Carb liquid scintillation
spectrometer in Bray's medium (BRAY 1960).<p>

Amino acid analysis.  All amino acids were determined using a Beckman
amino acid analyser. Free amino acid samples were prepared by
homogenising the material in 5.5% TCA at 0*degrees*C.  After 2 hrs the
homogenate is centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant is
diluted with the same volume od distillated water.  Protein amino
acids were determined by taking the sediment left after extraction of
free amino acids and hydrolyzing in G&#151; HCl at 110*degrees*C for 24
hrs. The sample was dissolved. in 2.5% TCA.<p>

RESULTS<p>

1.  Inhibition by FPhe: Inhibitory effects due to FPhe are manifested
through all stages of development (Table 1).  If the germination
process is not affected, production of a full leaves rosette is
delayed or even completely prevented.  The leaves were smaller in size
and pale green which leads to a noticeable reduction of fresh and dry
weight of plants.  Initiation of the inflorescence axis is also
clearly delayed. Fertility is considerably affected by the production
of less and smaller pods.  Survival at maturity is not severely
affected even though some plans are completely sterile.<p>

The effective concentration (EC) (1.10E-4M FPhe) which shall be used
to operate the selection of resistant mutants has been chosen by
considering the performance of plants at different levels, but mainly
on the basis of the concentration effects on fertility.<p>

Table 1: Effect of different concentrations of FPhe on development of
wild type plants.<p>

The effect of FPhe at the effective concentration was investigated by
measuring 14C-leucine incorporation over different times in the plants
(Figure 1).  FPhe could not induce a high reduction in the rate at
which leucine is incorporated into proteins at short-time incubations,
but when seedlings were incubated for longer periods (up to 30 hrs),
there was a serious inhibitory effect, the rate of incorporation being
reduced to 62.5% after a treatment of 30 hours.<p>

2.  Selection of resistant mutants: M2 seeds collected from ethyl
methane sulfonate treated plants were sown on the EC of the analogue
and the selection was primarily based on the size of the rosette and
the fertility.  One mutant showing resistance to FPhe was found on
14.500 M2 tested plants. The life cycle of the mutant extends over 100
days in greenhouse conditions and the plant develops a very large and
compact rosette (mutant CR).  The inflourescence axis develops some 65
days after sowing. The plant presents a very robust appearance but
shows however a certain degree of sterility under normal conditions
(44% compared to the wild type).<p>

3.  Properties of the resistant mutant CR<p>

a.  Developmental aspects: The development of mutant CR was studied on
different concentrations of the analogue to confirm its resistance and
to what extent (Table 2). At the EC, mutant CR did not show any marked
effect with regard to the action of the analogue. The fertility of the
CR mutant is 83.1% while that of the wild type is only 54,9%.  At
3.10E-4M FPhe, the wild type plants were completely sterile where as
the mutant showed 24,8% fertility (Figure 2). Resistance of the mutant
in FPhe is also obvious as we considered the evolution of dry weight
or survival at maturity (see also Figure 2); when the percentage of
survival dropped to zero at 5.10E-4M FPhe with the wild type, 92,5% of
the mutant survived to maturity.<p>

circles) mutant CR (closed circles).<p>

b) Effects on metabolism: The rate of incorporation of 3m-leucine into
proteins - in the presence or the absence of the analogue--was
estimated by both mutant CR and wild type. Table 3 shows that in the
case of mutant CR, FPhe, at the EC, does not produce any substantial
reduction in the rate of incorporation of leucine into proteins, but a
clear cut reduction of this incorporation in the wild type.  Under
normal conditions of growth, the incorporation of leucine is
practically the same of both wild type and mutant CR. Effect of
different concentrations of FPhe shows that very high concentrations
like 1.10E-3M upset also the metabolism of the mutant, but at a lower
rate when compared to that in the wild type (Figure 3).<p>

c) Genetic studies: Reciprocal crosses have been made between the
mutant and the wild type. F1 seeds sown in a medium containing
2.5x10E-4M FPhe are nonresistant, with a compact rosette.  Out of 2172
F2 plants, 1663 were nonresistant and 509 resistant (chi squ. =
2.82). Resistance therefore is single gene determined and recessive to
wild type. The 1663 nonresistant plants included 520 plants with a
single normal rosette and all resistant plants of the F2 generation
developed a compact rosette. This indicates that the genes for
resistance and compact rosette are very closely linked or that we are
dealing with a single mutated gene showing pleiotropic effects.<p>

d) Biochemical studies: The rate of uptake and the metabolic fate of
the analogue have been studied in mutant CR. Experiments conducted
with eight-day-old seedlings of mutant CR and wild type incubated in a
medium containing 14C-FPhe indicate that the uptake system is fully
functional in this mutant (Figure 4).  However at longer periods of
incubation (24 h), there is also an inhibition in this rate with the
mutant CR. The reduced uptake may be due to over accumulation of
analogue molecules in the cellular pool owing to poor translocation or
utilization. The intracellular accumulations should produce some sort
of feedback control over further uptake.<p>

Table 4: Rate of uptake and incorporation of 14C-FPhe in the wild type
and mutant CR (cpm for 5 seedlings)<p>

Results shown in Table 4 and Figure 4 that the mutant fails to
incorporate FPhe into proteins, the reduction in the rate being
particularly significant - 70.5% in % to wild type--after an
incubation of 24 h. This also suggests that a large proportion of FPhe
molecules are retained in the concentration pool without being
incorporated into proteins.  Hence, the control over the metabolic
fate of the analogue is the factor fundamentally responsible for this
resistance.  It is not excluded that the analogue, soon after uptake,
is converted to a harmless compound by removal of the fluorine
component. Determination of amino acid composition of the proteins
after incubation of seedlings in FPhe, at the EC for 4 hr, shows that
the small quantity of analogue incorporated in mutant CR is in the
form of FPhe itself.<p>

We have also checked the rate of protein synthesis in mutant CR by
following the incorportion of 14C-Phe supplied exogenously.  The
results presented in Table 5 indicate that the uptake and
incorporation of phenylalanine follow the same trend in both strains
and thus that protein synthesis proceeds at the normal rate in mutant
CR.<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol13/vol13-pg93-tab5.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

Table 5: Rate of uptake and incorporation of 14C - Phe in the wild
type and mutant CR (cpm for 5 seedlings).<p>

Under normal growth conditions, the free amino acid composition
remains the same in both strains.  However, the concentration of free
amino acids, except that of Phe, is higher in the wild type when FPhe
is present in the medium (Table 6).  This suggests that the analogue
inhibits protein synthesis and the FPhe interferes with the production
of Phe, which may be due to some feedback control over the
biosynthesis of Phe. These types of inhibition on protein and Phe
synthesis are not observed in the case of the mutant. The mutant Cr is
not an overproducer of phenylalanine or tyrosine, both in the presence
or absence of the analogue. A certain accumulation of FPhe molecules
are noticeable in this mutant, which confirms that the uptake system
operates satisfactorily in mutant CR.<p>

or the absence of FPhe (EC) after 24 h. incubation (diluted in 6ml

CONCLUSION<p>

The structural analogue FPhe induces toxic effects on the growth,
development and metabolism of Arabidopsis. The resistance of mutant CR
to FPhe is due to the ability of the plant to discriminate between Phe
and FPhe for incorporation into proteins, and it is the result of a
single, recessive gene mutation.  In the wild type, the analogue is
actively incorporated into protein, whereas in the mutant it is
selectively rejected.  Unil now the resistance of plant mutants
against amino acid analogues was reported to be due to a decreased
uptake or to the overproduction of the corresponding natural amino
acid (CARLSON 1973), WILDHOLM 1971, 1974).  The selection of mutants
resistant to FPhe has been reported in carrot and tobacco cell
cultures. The resistance should be partially due to decreased uptake
but also to an increase of the level of free phenylalanine (PALMER et
al. 1975). In the mutant CR, the uptake system is functional and there
is no oversynthesis of phenylalanine or tyrosine. Therefore, the
decreased incorporation of FPhe into protein could be due to an
altered phanylalanyl-RNA synthetase--as reported by FANGMAN et al.,
1964 in E. coli or to a modified t-RNA loading and transport
mechanism. These possible causes of the resistance are now under
investigation.<p>
