The investigation of the chloroplast structure of A. thaliana mutants
showed that nuclear gene mutations lead to rather essential plastid
structure changes. Chloroplasts of the dark-green mutant 1084 whose
structure is normal at the reproduction phase are filled up by the
starch grains pressed to the envelope at the phase of breeding. The
yellow mutant V-76 is characterized by a lamellar type of the membrane
system. Chloroplasts of parenchyma sheath cells of C4 plants.<p>

According to the potential intensity of photosynthesis, the mutant
1084 doesn't differ largely from the original race at the generative
phase, while the mutant V-76 has a much higher potential intensity of
photosynthsis (Table 1).  At the reproduction phase and breeding phase
the potential activity of photosynthesis is lower in the mutant than
in the wildtype race En.<p>

Table 1:<p>

The analyses of soluble carbohydrate content from A. thaliana mutants
at the period of ontogenesis showed that nuclear gene mutations cause
different types of carbohydrate changes (Table 2).<p>

At the generative phase, in the original race the quantity of
saccharose and fructose is almost the same; glucose is twice as high
as that of the other carbohydrates, and its starch quantity is 43.7
mg.g.<p>

Table 2:<p>

At the reproduction phase soluble carbohydrate quantity always
decrease, while starch quantity is increased.  At the generative phase
of mutant 1084 saccharose and fructose quantity do not differ greatly,
while glucose quantity is 4 times higher.  Starch quantity is the same
as in the original race. At the phase of reproduction this mutant
shows an increased quantity of all soluble carbohydrates; starch
quantity is almost two times decreased.  At the phase of reproduction
there is a slight increase in saccharose and fructose quantity, and a
decrease in glucose quantity. Starch quantity is 30 times increased.
At the phase of breeding the carbohydrate content is decreased in
total with the exception of the starch content in En.<p>

On the basis of the experimental data we can conclude that gene
mutations cause changes in structural organization and function of
chloroplasts.<p>
