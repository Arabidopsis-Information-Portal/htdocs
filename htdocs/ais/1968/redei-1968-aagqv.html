<h2>Arabidopsis as a research tool in genetics</h2><p>

G.P. REDEI and S.L LI<p>

Arabidopsis is not an economic plant.  It is used only as a tool to
study basic biological problems.  Findings should be applicable to
other plants, possibly to different organisms. A tool should be
efficient and convenient, providing maximum information with minimal
requirements for labor, facilities and expenditures. This plant has
been in use for some time in several laboratories.  Just knowing how
Arabidopsis meets expectations and is regarded by fellow biologists is
interesting to note.  There are several reasons in making such an
inquiry in this issue of the Arabidopsis Information Service.<p>

Sixty years ago the first experimental paper on Arabidopsis appeared
(LAIBACH, 1907).  Twenty-five years ago the suitability of Arabidopsis
for genetic and developmental research was demonstrated (LAIBACH,
1943).  In 1967 the "father of Arabidopsis, Professor Dr.  Friedrich
LAIBACH, died leaving a heritage that he cultivated in the traditions
of his teacher, Eduard STRASBURGER, the great founder of cytology.<p>

For a long time Arabidopsis was a one man's research tool.  This plant
could not be meaningfully compared with Drosophila, maize or
Escherichia coli as to the number of qualified investigators, or to
the extent of facilities or funds involved in its use and development.
Today the number of scientific reports dealing with this plant nears
300, an impressive record, hence outlining the major achievements
within the framework of Arabidopsis Information Service is impossible.<p>

In order to assess the present status and usefulness of Arabidopsis, a
questionnaire was circulated among the members of the Department of
Genetics of the University of Missouri to obtain their views on
Arabidopsis as compared to nine other organisms ranging from man to
viruses.  Unfortunately many outstanding genetic organisms could not
be included.  Mouse, Ephestia, snapdragon, tomato, barley, rice,
Oenothera, yeast, Paramecium, etc. have been omitted along with other
equally useful tools.  Enough burden was placed upon the cooperative
volunteers by answering 140 questions conscientiously.  The group
includes former students or associates of MORGAN, BRIDGES, STURTEVENT,
EAST, and STADLER, varying in rank from a graduate student to a member
of the National Academy of Science.  Persons polled had experience
with all the organisms listed in the questionnaire. Though only eleven
answers were received, a good cross-section of the community of basic
geneticists was represented, including both sexes and a wide variety
of age groups.  A maximum of 10 scores was given to the most suitable
organisms for a particular type of research and zero marked the
unsuitables.  The combined scores are summarized in the table. Rating
was anonymous.  Homogeneity of the eleven responses was reasonably
good. Total scores given to particular fields apparently reflects the
subconscious appreciation of the participlants for certain areas of
research.<p>

indicating the potential usefulness of the named organisms for a
particular field of research<p>

Evaluating the results proved interesting. Though Arabidopsis is
relatively a newcomer as a genetic tool, its overall suitability for
genetic research was judged very favorably (Figure 1).  This rating
appears reasonable. There is little doubt that higher organisms are
the most versatile tools of genetics; microorganisms (fungi, algae,
and bacteria, and viruses) are not well-fitted to cytological
approaches, as shown in the overall scores with the latter techniques
counting high.  The difficulties in genetic manipulations of higher
mammals is reflected in the overall low rating of man as a genetic
organism.  In biochemical and molecular genetics microorganisms were
rated well above higher organisms.  But also in those two fields,
Arabidopsis was definitely favored above all other multicellular
organisms.<p>

areas of major importance<p>

When Drosophila, maize, Arabidopsis, and bacteria are compared in the
eight major genetic areas, Arabidopsis is rated best in 2, the same
index for Drosophila is 2, for maize 2, for bacteria 1 (Figure 2).  In
only one field is Arabidopsis at the bottom, and this is perhaps one
of the least active areas in genetics.  Other evaluations could be
made, but the small samplings discourages this.  In some areas the
judgments were clearly biased by unknown factors.  Bacteria should not
have been rated as low for recombination studies and certainly not
below Arabidopsis.  Nonetheless, the overall figures are not
unrealistic.<p>

LAIBACH in his prescient address at the Symposium on Arabidopsis
Research in Gottingen, 1965, anticipated just what is presented in
these statistics when he said: "...wenngleich...Viren und Bakterien
sicherlich manches Grundsatzliche aufzeigen konnen, so konnen sie auf
das Problem der Entwicklung und Phylogenie bei den Blutenpflanzen doch
wohl schwerlich die letzte Antwort geben.  Bei dem Versuch, diesem
Ziel naher zu kommen, kann, so bin ich sicher, dis kleine Arabidopsis
thaliana Helfer, vielleicht sogar Schrittmacher sein".<p>
