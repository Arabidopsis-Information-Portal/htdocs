In previous communications (DOBROVOLNA, 1968, 1969a,b; CETL and
RELICHOVA, 1971) high heritability coefficients of some developmental
characters were found by means of offspring-parent regression
coefficients not only in variable natural populations but also in a
uniform one.<p>

In the last years, samplings of the seed material were undertaken in
the mountains Hryby Jesenik from the topmost to the foot positions. As
yet, heritability was estimated in four population samples.  For
cultivation conditions see CETL, RELICHOVA-DOBROVOLNA and KRSKOVA,
1970.  In three population samples, the offspring-parent regression
coefficients, bOP and bObarP did not differ significantly from zero;
analogously, the W oefficients were low.  Only in the remaining
population sample originating from the upmost locality, the
estimations of heritability were high and significant. The absence of
measurable heritability was connected with low variability in the
character studied (Table).<p>

Table 1: The mean number of days to appearance of the flower primordia
(x-bar +- std. dev.) with the variability coefficient (v) and the estimates of
heritability of this character given as offspring-parent regression
coefficients (bOP, bObarP) and as intraclass correlation coefficients (W) in
four samples of natural populations of Arabidopsis from the mountain
Hruby Jesenik.<p>

Several hypotheses might be drawn to explain this unexpected
difference in variability and heritability of population samples as to
the developmental character.  Most probably, however, this fact can be
connected with extreme environmental conditions on the mountain
localities where only unique genotypes could be successful in founding
a population.<p>
