The University of Toronto offers the opportunity to teach, conduct research and live in 
one of the most diverse cities in the world, and is responsive to the needs of dual career 
couples. The University of Toronto is strongly committed to diversity within its community and 
especially welcomes applications from visible minority group members, women, Aboriginal persons, 
persons with disabilities, members of sexual minority groups, and others who may contribute to 
the further diversification of ideas.

 

All qualified candidates are encouraged to apply; however, Canadians and permanent residents 
will be given priority.
