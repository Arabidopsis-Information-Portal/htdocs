<h2> The quantitative determination of the vernalization requirement in two late flowering mutants of Arabidopsis</h2><p>

There are data that late flowering mutants can be produced from early
forms.  In Arabidopsis, HUSSEIN (1968) determined the genetic
constitution of seven such mutants.  At the same time, he studied
their vernalization response after 4 weeks of seed vernalization and
he found that all mutants responded well to vernalization with some
differences in the amount of response.<p>

Methods of quantitative determination of the vernalization requirement
were applied to independent late mutants obtained from M2 populations
of the race Dijon G after treatment of dry seeds by
N-nitroso-N-methylurea.  So far, experiments with two mutants (L5 and
L6) are completed.  Seeds in soil culture (cf. CETL,
RELICHOVA-DOBROVOLNA, and KRSKOVA, 1970) were vernalized for 0
(control) to 40 days at 2 +/- 1*degree*C in a dark room.  Then, the
cultures were kept at 25 +/- 3*degrees*C under continuous illumination
(1250 lux) for 42 days. The mean number of days from germination to
appearance of flower primordia (x) and the mean number of rosette
leaves (y) were determined. The results are given in the Table.<p>

Table: Changes in the mean number of days to appearance of flower
primordia (x) and in the mean number of rosette leaves (y) with
increasing vernalization rate<p>

While the initial race Dijon G did not react on vernalization both
late mutants showed a clear response, the amount of which could be
expressed (1) as the ratios, (mean x-control)/(mean x-40 days) and
(mean y-control)/(mean y-40 days)  (cf/ HUSSEIN, 1968); (2) as
the percentage of generative plants in the controls in a 42 day
experiment; (3) as the minimum vernalization rate necessary to have
all plants generative.<p>

As to the criterion (1), the ratios (mean x-control)/(mean x-40 days)
in the initial race Dijon G were about 1,00 (in two experiments 0,93,
and 1.03, respectively), but 1,37 in the mutant L5, and 2,03 in the
mutant L6.  The (mean y-control)/(mean y-40 days) ratios were
similarly 1,00 in Dijon G, 1,26 in the mutant L5, and 2,28 in the
mutant L6.  These values show that the race Dijon G does not react on
vernalization while in the less late mutant L5 the response was weak
in comparison with that of the more late mutant L6.<p>

The comparison according to critria (2) and (3) furnished similar
conclusions, but the behaviour of the less late mutant L5 was
undiscernible from that of the race Dijon G: In both genotypes the
percentage of generative plants in the controls was 100, while in the
mutant L6 only 78,22% of the plants showed flower primordia after 42
days. The minimum vernalization rate leading to the generative
development of all plants was zero days in Dijon G and L5, but five
days in L6.  Apparently, the other late mutants also show different
amounts of vernalization requirement.  At any rate, in both late
mutants studied as yet vernalization reaction was induced and at the
same time, quite different mounts of vernalization requirement were
found.<p>
