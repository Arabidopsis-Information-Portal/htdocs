ROBuST: Regulation Of Biological Signalling by Temperature  
 
We are proud to announce the £6M ROBuST project, one of six UK projects  
funded by BBSRC and EPSRC under the SABR initiative. ROBuST will investigate  
the effects of temperature on a defined molecular network that controls  
plant development, using tightly-linked experimental and theoretical  
approaches with strong informatics support. The ten ROBuST partners include  
biologists working on molecular signalling and climate change,  
mathematicians, statisticians and informaticians at the Universities of  
Edinburgh, Warwick, York and Liverpool.  
 
We are now recruiting a high-calibre, interdisciplinary research team for  
this large-scale project. Excellent facilities are available for modelling  
of dynamic biological processes, molecular genetics, biochemistry and high  
throughput data acquisition.
