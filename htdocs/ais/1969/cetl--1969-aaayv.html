Following well defined mutants of Arabidopsis were produced by
N-nitroso-N-methylurea:<p>

autumnalis (aut):
	Cotyledons smaller, yellow green, Germination delayed and not
uniform.  Rosettes loose, smaller.  Leaves light green, narrower,
pointed.  Petioles shorter.  Very early flowering, especially in early
autumn.  Inflourescences loose, pods short and cylindrical.
	F1 after crossing with the standard type: normal.
	F2 yet unknown.
	Origin: Dijon G after 0.05 mM NMU.  From M2 to M6 constant, in
the M3 new aberrant types appeared.<p>

delicata (da):
	Cotyledons smaller. Rosettes somewhat smaller, delicate.
Leaves bright green.  Flowering slightly delayed.
	F1 after crossing with the standard type: normal.
	F2 yet unknown.
	Origin: Dijon G after 0.10 mM NMU.  From M2 to M6 constant.<p>

deltoidea (dl):
	Cotyledons smaller.  Germination not uniform. Rosettes small.
Leaves deltoid, pointed, dentate, decurrent, grayish.  Very late
flowering.  Inflorescences loose, pods thin, subfertile.
	F1 after crossing with the standard type: normal.
	F2 117 normal: 35 dl.
	Origin: Dijon G after 0.10 mM NMU.  From M2 to M6 constant, in
the M4 new constant aberrant type appeared (see rotondifolia, rf).<p>

grisea (gr):
	Cotyledons grayish green.  Rosettes flat, compact, small.
Leaves roundish, broadest on the basis, grayish green. Influorescences
looser.
	F1 after crossing with the standard type: normal.
	F2 18 normal: 8 gr.
	Origin: Dijon G after 0.05 mM NMU. Detected in a M3 line
derived from a weak M2 plant. From M3 to M6 constant.<p>

lucida (lc):
	Cotyledons yellow green. Rosettes compact, slightly smaller.
First leaves roundish, the following ones normal, shining yellow
green.  Young leaves greener.  Very late flowering.
	F1 after crossing with the standard type: normal.
	F2 100 normal: 35 lc
	Origin: Dijon G after 0.05 mM NMU. From M2 to M6 constant.<p>

lanceolata (ln):
	Cotyledons narrower, with visible petioles.  Rosettes loose,
smaller. Leaves pointed, narrower, lance-shaped, extremely decurrent.
Petioles long. Very early flowering. Influorescences looser.
	F1 after crossing with the standard type: normal.
	F2 yet unknown
	Origin: Dijon G after 0.10 mM NMU. From M2 to M6 constant.<p>

quasinormalis (qn):
	Cotyledons larger. Rosettes small. Leaves with necrotic edges.
Influorscences loose.  Subfertile.  Expression of all these characters
very variable, in certain experimental conditions resembling the
standard type.
	F1 after crossing with the standard type: normal.
	F2 115 normal: 36 qn.
	Origin: Dijon G after 0.10 mM NMU.  Detected in the M4 line,
derived from the mutant line deltoidea, dl (see above).  From M4 to M6
constant.<p>

In many other mutants, pure lines were as yet not obtained and
numerous new aberrant types continue to appear during the breeding
experiments.  In some M3 lines, often six or more different aberrant
types could be found. Experiments have been carried out to explain
this behaviour.<p>
