SUMMARY<p>

It is shown that the number of pods with mutations in M 1-plants does
not conform to the binomial distribution, so the formulae usually used
in finding confidence intervals of P and M according to m b are not
right. Adequate formulae are obtained, the main consequences of which
are as follows:<p>

a) the error in finding mean values of P and M is several times
greater than it follows from the binomial model;<p>

b) for determining disperisons of m b, P and M it is necessary to know
the mean number of IC per plant in each test variant;<p>

c) in view of consequences (a) and (b), use of the m b-index does not
give any advantages in comparison to the m a-index.<p>

The modification of a traditional experimental scheme is observed and
named the method of "excluding chimerity" in which only one pod per
each M 1-plant is analysed. It is shown that at one and the same
number of analysed pods the precision of evaluating M and P according
to the method of "excluding chimerity" is several times greater than
that according to the traditional scheme. In addition it is not
necessary to know the IC number when using the method of "excluding
chimerity": for determining dispersions of P and M. All this is basic
to recommend the method of "excluding chimerity" for applying it in
experimental mutagenesis.<p>

INTRODUCTION<p>

When estimating the efficiency of mutagen activity on seeds or
seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana the frequency of lethal embryonic
(LEM) and chlorophyll (LChM) mutations is taken into consideration
because these mutations arise at high frequency and are easily
registered by the embryo test. During the embryo test P-values (the
frequency of initial cells (IC) with mutations) and M-values (the mean
number of mutations per one IC) are usually found by one of the
following indices: m a (frequency of plants of the first generation (M
1), where pods with mutations are found) and m b (the frequency of
pods with mutations); P and M are calculated by the known formulae
(Ivanov, 1974).<p>

Analysing different quantitative indices of mutation processes, V.I.
Ivanov in his monograph (Ivanov, 1974) points out that for the
evaluation of M and P-values the m b-index is more preferable than m a
because n is not necessary when we find M by mb. Besides, the
precision of the estimation of M and P according to m b is higher than
according to m a as m b, is determined by a greater sample than m a.
However, this conclusion is based on the wrong method for the
estimation of dispersion of m b (binomial model), so the question of
relative merits of m a and m b-indices requires a revision.<p>

Dispersions of P and M.<p>

Knowing dispersions for m a and m b it is easy to calculate them for P
and M using formulae (1) and (2). Usually, dispersions of m a and m b
are found by formulae of the binomial distributions:<p>

Let all the conditions necessary for the correctness of formulae (1)
and (2) (Ivanov, 1974) be fulfilled. Then let it be N plants in M 1,
each plant has n IC, and b pods are analysed in each plant. Then, if k
IC mutated in a plant, the probability to find m pods with mutations
on this plant equals<p>

Table 1: Dispersion of P at different indices (m a and m b) in
dependence on n and P (N = 400)<p>

Since in order to find the P-value both according to m a and m b, it
is necessary to know the number of IC, then from the methodical point
of view both indices are equal and the choice of one of them should be
determined by the precision of the P-value. It follows that it is
better to use m a at low and mean mutation frequencies (P<0.3) and it
is better to use m b at high ones. Since literature lacks data on
frequencies of arising LChM greater than 0.3 even for sublethal doses
of mutagenes, then m a-index should be used for the evaluation of LChM
frequencies. The m b-index is needed only at high mutagen doses for
the evaluation of induction frequencies of LEM (or the sum of LEM and
LChM).<p>

We do not consider the m c-index as it is non-specific for the
embryo-test. Besides, another paper will be devoted to the characters
if this index. Here we point out that *delta*sq.Pc also depends on n and *delta*sq.Pc is always greater than *delta*sq.Pb.  The mc-index should be used during the embrio-test only at very high mutation frequencies when practically all pods contain mutations.  Calculations show athat if P&lt;=1-10 Nn^-1, then the P-value according to mb is more precise than according to mc. In real experiments where N &gt;= 100 and N approximates 2 the critical value of P*alpha* equals 0.95 (M=3), i.e. in practice during the embryo-test mb is always more preferable than mc.<p>

The number of IC is necessary for the interval evaluation of P
independently of the index used. Earlier we have shown that it may
depend on a mutagen dose (Usmanov et al., 1980; Mednik and Usmanov,
1982). Thus, it is necessary to determine the number of IC in each
variant of the experiment but it creates methodical difficulties.
Moreover, the number of IC is usually determined according to a small
sample and therefore with little preciseness. In its turn, the
dispersion of P increases. Further on we shall consider the scheme of
the experiment which makes it possible to get rid of lthe drawbacks
mentioned above (method of "excluding of chimerity") and to compare it
with the traditional one.<p>

As it is known, pods of Arabidopsis as a rule are non-chimeric
(Ivanov, 1974; Shevchenko and Grinikh, 1981). So if only one pod in a
plant is analysed then it formally means that all M 1 plants have only
one IC, i.e., they are non-chimeric. Obviously, the evaulation of P is
not changed and the dispersion of P for the method of "exclusing
chimerity" (*delta*'sq.P) can be determined by formula (11) if b = n - l. Then<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol26/vol26-pg72-fig15.gif">Click here for figure</a><p>

where N' is the number of pods analysed (the number of plants in M 1).<p>

In the traditional method the number of pods on each plant is sampled
in such a way that the probability of finding mutations in any IC
should not be less than 0.95; when n = 2 b = 5, when n = 3 b = 8 and
so on (Usmanov et al., 1980). In total Nb pods are analysed during the
embryo-test. Let us compare the number of pods necessary to analyse at
both methods to get equal precision in the estimation of P.<p>
