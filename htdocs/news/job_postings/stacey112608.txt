Two Postdoctoral Positions Open 
 
University of Missouri, Columbia 
 
 
 
Two postdoctoral positions are available immediately to study different 
aspects of soybean genomics and genetics. 
 
1.      One position, funded by a recent NSF Plant Genome grant, will 
focus on the development and analysis of large, mutagenized populations 
of soybean. For this position, prior experience with plant molecular 
biology and genetics would be preferable. 
2.      The Second position focuses on the identification and mapping of 
soybean genes involved in innate immunity to pathogens. For this 
position, prior training in plant pathology and plant molecular biology 
is preferred. Experience with plant genetics will also be a plus. 
 
In both cases, candidates for these positions should have a solid track 
record of academic and research achievement. Both are challenging 
positions and part of larger cooperative projects. Salary will be 
competitive and commensurate with experience. Suitable candidates should 
email their curriculum vita and letter of interest (identifying which of 
the two positions is sought) to
