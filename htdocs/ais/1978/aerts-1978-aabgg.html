During the last years many attempts have been made to integrate
foreign DNA into the genome of plant cells. The use of Agrobacterium
tumefaciens as vector for genetic engineering of plants has been
suggested to be a valuable possibility (Schell and Van Montague,
1977). Recently it has been shown that part of the Ti-plasmid is
incorporated in the plant cells (Chilton et al., 1977) and is coding
there for the synthesis of a corresponding mRNA (Drummond et al.,
1977). If a certain genetic information is incorporated in that part
of the Ti-plasmid, it could be transferred with it to the plant cells.<p>

Because of its small DNA content and its short life cycle and because
of the establishment of its in vitro culture conditions (Negrutiu,
1976), we have chosen Arabidopsis thaliana for an approach of this
problem.<p>

Preliminary experiments were carried out with the Agrobacterium
tumefaciens strains T37, C58 (nopaline strains, i.e. induce tumors
containing nopaline and can catabolize nopaline) and ACH5 (octopine
strain). Tumors were induced on 3 week old plants by wounding the stem
with a needle that previously was dipped in an agar colony of the
bacterium. After 3 weeks the tumors, which had a diameter of 1 a2 mm,
were excised, surface sterilized and cultured in vitro on solidified
PG O medium (Negrutiu et al., 1975) without added auxin or cytokinin.
Bacteria-free tumor tissue could be obtained by culturing it during 6
weeks in the presence of 1 mg/ml of carbenicillin.<p>

During in vitro culture the T37 and C58 tumors immediately and almost
completely differentiated into teratomata and normal plants. The ACH5
tumors initially grew as undifferentiated tissue, but after some
transfers also differentiated spontaneously into teratomata and --in
lesser extent-- to normal plants.<p>

The tumerous state of the callus and redifferentiated plants were
confirmed by octopine and nopaline determinations (manuscript in
preparation).<p>
