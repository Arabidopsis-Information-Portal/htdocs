Three Post-doctoral positions available in genetics of flowering. 
Creative Research Initiative, Korea University, Seoul, Korea 


Three postdoctoral researcher positions are available starting 
immediately to study long-distance signaling of flowering time 
regulation, miRNA-mediated ambient temperature-responsive flowering, and 
biochemistry of floral integrator proteins in Arabidopsis at Korea 
University, Seoul, Korea. These are full-time grant-funded positions 
(Creative Research Initiative in Korea). The project will use grafting 
techniques, molecular genetic approaches of the FT/TFL1 family genes, or 
transcriptional analysis on the precursor of ambient 
temperature-responsive miRNAs in Arabidopsis. A strong background on 
protein biochemistry (e.g. protein phosphorylation) and previous 
experience in grafting experiments in Arabidopsis are a plus. Successful 
applicants will be expected to show a high degree of research 
productivity, good communication skills (both oral and written), and an 
ability to work collaboratively with other lab members. Starting salary 
will be commensurate with previous experience of the applicant.
