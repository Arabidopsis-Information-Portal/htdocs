We have previously described the acid phosphatase polymorphism
occurring in Arabidopsis and the genetic analysis of electrophoretic
variants (JACOBS and SCHWIND, 1972; JACOBS and SCHWIND, 1973).  We
report in this issue other aspects of the combined biochemical and
genetical analysis of acid phosphatases.<p>

1.  Survey of the electrophoretic variation<p>

We have already mentioned the AP-1 group of acid phosphatase isozymes,
characterized by a high activity level and the occurrence of four
bands in each homozygous variant.  The AP-1 variants are under the
control of three codominant alleles (APS-1, API-1, APF-1)<p>

We have also obsrved the existence of two other isozyme groups, AP-2
and AP-3.  The AP-2 system which includes three faint bands after
electrophoresis on starch-gel (see, JACOBS, 1971) is characterized by
a weak activity level and a faster migration rate to the anode than
the AP-1 enzymes. The patterns also vary according to the geographical
races, but independently of the AP-1 bands. For instance, Zu
represents a race distinct from two other races Chi and Wil by the
particular migration of the second AP-2 band (Fig. 1). This absence of
corrrelation between AP1 and AP2 variants leads to the concept of a
particular genetic control of AP-2 system which is now analyzed.  This
AP-2 group can be resolved in a high number of bands after isoelectric
fosusing on polyacrylamide gels.<p>

The AP-3 is represented by two faint bands migrating to the cathode.
These bands are only detectable in plants cultured in liquid medium,
supplemented with 2% glucose (REDEI, 1971).  These cathodal isozymes
could represent a third genetically controlled acid phosphatase
enzyme.<p>

leaf extracts of Arabidopsis API-1 type = Wil, APS-1 type = Zue.<p>

In this type of submerged culture, betaglycerophosphate (5-10 E-4M) as
the only source of phosphate in the medium can assure the growth of
Arabidopsis plants.  Zymograms obtained from such plants do not show
modifications in acid phosphatase patterns.<p>

2.  Control of the AP-1 set of isozymes<p>

One of the possible reasons to obtain a set of four isozymes might
arise from the existence of different aggregates of acid phosphatase
monomers.  In order to test this hypothesis, electrophoresis was
performed in 10% and 15% starch concentration according to SMITHIES
(1962).  The retardation coefficient calculated for each band shows
approximately the same value, 43%. These results indicate that the
multiple molecular forms do not probably represent distinct multimeric
proteins.<p>

To confirm this assumption, a gel filtration of leaf extract was
performed in Bio-gel P 150.  Results are shown in Fig. 2 in which
protein spectrum and acid phosphatase activities are represented. The
most active fraction was electrophoretically tested and the zymogram
obtained displays the typical AP-1 four bands pattern. The separation
of acid phosphatase isozymes is now tested by DEAE cellulose
chromatography.<p>

column of Bio-Gel P 150 equilibrated with a 0.005 M acetate buffer pH

presence of 0.001 M p-nitrophenylphosphate at 400 m micro; the solid
line represents the protein spectrum measured at 280 m micro.<p>

3.  Organ-specific variation<p>

The zymograms obtained with extracts from various organs of
Arabidopsis show the same four bands-pattern of the AP-1 group, except
for dry seeds (Fig. 3).  The four isozymes are however represented in
varying concentrations, in comparison with the activity distribution
observed in the leaves.  In roots for instance the two first bands are
present in a very low concentration.<p>

(race Wil, API-1 type). a: dry seeds, b: 64 hr-germinated seeds, c:
roots, d: leaves, e: stems, f: flowers<p>

The Wil seed zymogram displays nine bands four of them correspond to
the Wil leaf isozymes and four others are less anodal. The activity,
distributed equally among the nine bands in dry seeds, shifts
gradually as the germination proceeds to the bands which shall remain
active throughout the life cycle.  Preliminary investigations on the
genetic control of seed bands have shown that no strong absolute
correlation exits between the AP1 variants defined using leaf extracts
and dry seed electrophoretic patterns of the corresponding types.  It
is thus possible that a specific type of genetic control occurs in the
seeds.<p>

4.  Genetic control of the acid phosphatase activity<p>

Ethylmethanesulfonate (80 mM-3H) was used as mutagenic agent to induce
mutations in the activity of the acid phosphatase-1 gene-enzyme
system. The search for induced mutants was performed by subjecting to
starch gel electrophoresis extract from individual plants in the
progeny of a M1 treated plant.  Until now 1500 M2 plants were scored
for changes in the activity of/and changes of electrophoretic pattern.
Figure 4 shows four different types of activity distribution among the
bands. Type c appears with a relatively high frequency (0.45%) and
type d was scored only once. The mutants are now characterized and a
spot test assay (adapted from BELL et al., 1972) is now used to allow
the screening of large numbers of mutagenized plants with regard to
their activity.<p>

in progenies of EMS-treated plants.<p>

c: equal distribution of the activity among the bands d: inverted
activity distribution with regard to control pattern<p>

Moreover, a change in the electrophoretic pattern was observed in a
progeny of API-1 type seeds.  Multiple enzyme bands reappear but with
electrophoretic mobilities corresponding to those of the APF-1 type.
The spacing between isozymes of the set is not altered. These data
lead to the conclusion that the multiple AP-1 bands are all products
of the same gene.<p>
