Isolated protoplasts constitute a very useful experimental system for
studying the biochemical, physiological and cytochemical processes in
plants. After the successful production of a somatic cell hybrid in
Nicotiana (Carlson, et al., 1972), much attention has been paid to
using this technique in getting various kinds of hybrids in other
plants.<p>

The advantages of using Arabidopsis as an experimental material are
well known: it is easy to grow under sterile cultures; it has a short
life cycle, and a small chromosome number.  Furthrmore, many mutants
have been isolated in Arabidopsis, which has shown to be adaptable to
cell culture, which makes it a suitable material for investigating
problems of somatic cell genetics.<p>

Material and Methods<p>

Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana were grown on agar medium supplemented
with inorganic and organic salts under sterile conditions. After
receiving a cold treatment for 48 hours, the seeds in test tubes were
transferred to a culture room at 25*degrees*C under fluorescent light.
Plans varying in age from 25 days to 60 days were used for various
experiments. The protoplasts were isolated from leaves, shoots, roots,
flowers, and flower buds. Diploid callus was obtained either directly
from the seeds or by subculturing leaves and shoots.  Haploid callus
was obtained by culturing the anthers of Arabidopsis.<p>

Isolation of Protoplasts<p>

Leaves of various strains of Arabidopsis thaliana were cut into small
pieces from the sterile cultures growing in test tubes and put in an
enzyme mixture of the following composition:<p>

The pH of the enzyme mixture was adjusted to 5.6.  The incubation
flask was kept at low speed at 25%C in a water-bath shaker.<p>

Protoplasts were also isolated from callus, which had developed from
different parts of the plant.  Incubation of callus was carried out in
the same way as that of leaves except that the concentration of
mannitol was increased to 0.6M.<p>

Fusion<p>

After isolation, protoplasts were washed with .05M mannitol.  They
were then suspended in a solution containing the following chemicals:
Nitrates of Na, K, Ca and Mg and different salts of Ca++, high
molecular weight polyethylene glycol, gelatin or concanavalin A.
Observation of cell fusion was done microscopically.  Effect of high
pH was observed on fusion.<p>

Mutation<p>

Seeds of A. thaliana were treated with 16 mM ethylmethane sulfonate
for 16 hours, washed, surface sterilized and placed on minimal medium.
The plants which were growing poorly on the minimal medium were
suspected to be mutants and were picked up and transferred to a medium
rich in amino acids.  If they grew better, indvididual amino acids
were then tested to find out which amino acid the mutant could not
synthesize.<p>

Growth<p>

Isolated protoplasts as well as fused protoplasts were plated on
Murashige and Skoog liquid or solid medium (Murashige and Skoog, 1962)
at a density varying from 5 x 10 0E-2.5 x 10 5 protoplasts ml.
However, instead of 0.7 mannitol, 0.5M mannitol was added to the
medium. The petri plates were sealed with parafilm and kept in the
dark for 48 hours, after which they were transferred to 25*degrees*C
under fluorescent light.<p>

Results<p>

Isolation and Fusion<p>

High yield of protoplasts of the order of 2.27 x 20 6 protoplast/ml/gm
tissue was obtained from shoots, leaves, buds and flowers. Roots,
however, proved not to be a good source of protoplasts. Good yields
were obtained from plants between the age of 25 days to 56 days.
Minimum time of incubation for the release of protoplasts was one
hour.  Maximum release was obtained after 16 hours of incubation.
Protoplasts were found to be viable after this prolonged incubation,
as tested by the protoplasmic streaming and the incorporation of
radioactive precursors into TCA insoluble material, showing that they
are capable of synthesizing RNA and proteins.<p>

Intra-specific fusion in different strains of Arabidopsis thaliana has
been achieved and multinucleate protoplasts have been obtained (Figure
1).  Shoot and leaf protoplasts have also been observed to fuse.  In
addition, there are some indications that fusion between pea and
Arabidopsis protoplasts is possible.  Among the various chemicals
tried for bringing about fusion, high molecular weight, polyethylene
glycol was found most suitable and efficient.<p>

Isolation of Mutants<p>

Suspected amino acid mutants were obtained after treatment with 16mM
EMS.  These mutants grew well on amino acid rich medium but did not
set any seed and perished later. Attempts are now being made to grow
the callus of these mutants on various combinations of media.<p>

Fusion of Mutants<p>

Protoplasts from the callus of Py mutants and leaf mesophyll of Tz
mutants were observed to fuse by polyethylene glycol treatment.
Attempts are now being made to grow the fused product on a selective
medium in order to pick up the somatic hybrids.<p>

We hope to be able to extend this work by isolating and fusing
protoplasts between different mutants and to regenerate the fused
cells into mature plants showing the hybrid characteritics.<p>
