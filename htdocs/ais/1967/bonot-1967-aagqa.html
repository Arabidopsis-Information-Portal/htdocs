	We have previously observed (BONOTTO, JACOBS, and LEDOUX, 1965) that Arabidopsis seeds take up exogenous 3H-DNA and that the label is partly found in the seedlings after germination.  In order to know whether the penetration of exogenous nucleic acids is in some way related to endogenous DNA synthesis the following experiment was done.<p>

	Presoaked seeds (16 hrs in 0.01 M phosphate buffer, pH=7.0) were irradiated with 10-E5 rad of 60Co gamma rays, a dose which stops completely the 3H-thymidine incorporation into the DNA (BONOTTO, JACOBS, and LEDOUX, 1966).  At different times after irradiation the seeds were incubated during two hours in 0.01 M phosphate buffer containing Escherichia coli 3H-DNA (1.5 x 10-E6 dpm/microg) or 3H-thymidine (3 C/mM).  Suitable controls were treated in the same way.<p>

	The incorporation of 3H-thymidine into the DNA and the uptake of 3H-DNA by the seeds were followed by means of a technique utilizing centrifuged DEAE-cellulose paper pulp columns (DAVILLA, CHARLES, and LEDOUX, 1965) and results refer to the sum of radioactivity found in the acido-insoluble fractions.<p>

	The incorporation of 3H-thymidine into the DNA and the uptake of 3H-DNA by the seeds were followed by means of a technique utilizing centrifuged DEAE-cellulose paper pulp columns (DAVILA, CHARLES, and LEDOUX, 1965) and results refer to the sum of radioactivity found in the acido-insoluble fractions.<p>

	It was observed that for at least 3 hours after irradiation DNA synthesis was stopped or strongly reduced (Table 1).  Under the same experimental conditions, the seeds were able to take up exogenous DNA (Table 2).<p>

	These results seem to suggest that (a) the uptake of exogenous nucleic acids by the seeds takes place even in absence of endogenous synthesis of DNA, and (b) gamma rays inhibit the DNA synthesis but not the uptake of exogenous macromolecules.<p>
