A method for the aseptic culture of an intact higher plant Arabidopsis
thaliana (L.) HEYNH. in liquid medium is described.<p>

Various methods for the aseptic culture of the small Arabidopsis plant
have been reviwed (1). The plant was generally supported by agar,
silica gel (2), "perlite" (3) or soil (4).  Under these conditions,
the withdrawal of culture medium or the fast equilibrium of additives
with the medium during the course of experiment would be difficult.
Also, under such circumstances removal of the intact root system for
analysis would be problematical. This problem can be solved by liquid
culture such as reported by REDEI and PERRY (5). Their method is not
desirable if an aerial shoot system is also required for the
investigation. Therefore an aseptic culture method which fulfills the
requirements of using liquid medium and the development of an aerial
shoot system together with a normal root system of an intact plant is
reported here.<p>

This method utilizes a thin layer of Pyrex fiberglass wool for the
support of the plant while allowing for the supply of nutrients on its
moistened surface during germination stages. The piece of fiberglass
wool was in turn supported by a glass frame made by four 1" pyrex
galss rods (diameter 1/4").  The glass frame was formed by arranging
two glass rods parallel to each other but 1/4" apart.  The other two
glass rods were arranged in the same manner but were placed on top and
perpendicular to the bottom pair. The four contact points of the
glassrods were fused by heat.  The glass frame was then put on the
bottom of a cylindrical flat-bottomed glass vial (diametr 1 7/16",
height 4 3/4").  A circular piece of a single layer of fibrglass wool,
obtained from Corning Glass Works, Corning, New York, of 1 1/4"
diameter was cut out and placed on top of the glass frame.<p>

The composition of nutrient medium in mg per liter:
<pre>
glutamic acid       20
Ca (NO3)2. 4 H2O     1.8
MgSO4. 3 H2O         8.87
NH4NO3               8
KNO3                 8.4
KCl                  4.27
K2HPO4               8.4
H3BO3                2.86
MnSO4. H2O           1.8
ZnCl2                0.22
CuSO4. 5 H2O         0.08
(NH4)6 Mo7O24. 4 H2O 0.08
Fe2(SO4)3. 6 H2O     3.26
EDTA                 0.78

The nutrient medium was adjusted to pH 6.1 with HCl.  Sucrose was
added at 20 gm per liter.<p>

An aliquot of 5 ml nutrient medium was transferred into the glass
vial. The central portion of the piece of glass wool should be above
the level of nutrient medium while its periphral area submerged. The
entire piece of glass wool was then moistened with nutrient medium due
to the capillary action of the fine fiberglass wool structure. The
culture glass vial was covered with aluminum foil and sterilized in an
autoclave at 15 lb pressure for 7 minutes.<p>

The Arabidopsis seeds were surface sterilied by immersion in a mixture
of 95% ethanol: 1% H2O2 (1:10,v/v) for 3 minutes and washed three
times with strilized distilled water.<p>

Under aseptic conditions, a seed was transferred with a Pasteur
pipette to the center of the surface of the fiberglass wool. A square
piece (3" x 3") of Saran Wrap, which previously was sterilized in an
autoclave, was used to seal the top of the culture vial and was
secured with a rubber band. The Saran Wrap, made by the Dow Chemical
Company, Midland, Michigan, was used because it is transparent and has
a low transmission rate for H20 vapor.<p>

Immediately after planting the seed, the culture vial was maintained
at 24*degrees*C and illuminated continuously with 150 f.c. from
Wide-Spoectrum Grolux fluorescent light tubes in an environmental
growth chamber.<p>

After 2-3 days, germination began. The primary root penetrated down
through the porous fiberglass woold and eventually the whole root
system grew submerged in the liquid medium. The shoot system developed
above the fiberglass woold. Efflorescence started at about the 16th
day.  In general the plant frew as well as on 1% agar.<p>

The described aseptic liquid culture technique provides an easy and
economic assembly arrangement for the growth of an intact plant with
both submerged root and aerial shoot systems. These advantages may
prompt its use in the studies of physiology, agronomy and genetics.<p>
