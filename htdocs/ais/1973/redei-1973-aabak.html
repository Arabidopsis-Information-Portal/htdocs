<h2> Genetic and nutritional control of the glycolytic pathway in Arabidopsis, Cardaminopsis and Hylandra</h2><p>

Data of last year (REDEI, 1972) have shown that growing Arabidopsis,
Cardaminopsis and Hylandra on autoclaved fructose containing media
results in reduced levels of fructose-1,6-diphosphate aldolase.<p>

Continuation of the study with additional enzymes working in a
sequence (Fig. 1) revealed noteworthy trends (Table 1).  For the sake
of simplification of the extensive data, the information collected
with the three species is condensed to averages. Enzyme activities are
expressed anomalies of substrate cleaved or produce formed, as
applicable, per mg protein per minute.  It is remarkable that the
activities of enzymes depending on each other so closely, displayed
such large differences. Triosephosphateisomerase activity exceeded ca.
4,000 fold the activity of phosophofructokinase. There is only one
enzymatic step between the product of the latter enzyme and the
substrate of the former one.  Similar, although not of quite that
magnitude, differences are obvious among several other activities in
the plants grown on all three media.  One may wonder on the rationale
of this apparent absence of coordination within a single pathway.  It
is conceivable that the in vitro activity may not reflect the status
inside the cells of intact tissues, yet the differences are quite
impressive.<p>

Figure 2: The activity of some glycolytic enzymes extracted from
plants grown on autoclaved fructose (F) and autoclaved glucose (G),
relative to that obtained from plants raised on sugar-free media. The
average of the experiments condensed in Table 1.  The numbers refer to
the sequence of enzymes as listed in Table 1.<p>

If the activity of the enzymes in the plants grown on the two diffrent
hexose media is expressed as a percent of that in the extracts of
plants raised on sugar-free solutions an interesting tendency becomes
obvious. The relative activity of enzymes involved in deposition of
carbohydrates into starch, cellulose or in the diversion of them into
the pentose phosphate cycle is either unchanged or somewhat increased
under the condition of nutrition on autoclaved hexose media. The
activity of enzymes involved in the processing of sugars through
energy yielding reactions is somewhat decreased, however.  This
reduction is especially obvious in the activity of fructose-phosphate
aldolase when the plants were grown on fructose media.  Upon
autoclaving, fructose rapidly yields hydroxymethyl furfural,
hydroxyacetyl furan and a series of other compounds, highly toxic to
these plants. The breakdown of glucose is much less under the
conditions prevailing.<p>

This trend of enzyme activities was nicely reflected by the increased
starch, cellulose and anthocyanin production under sugar nutrition.
The same time, in accordance with the expectations based on enzyme
activities, a shortage in pyruvate, keto glutarate, phospholipids,
chlorophylls and carotenoids was obvious. Thus the genetically
determined level of enzymes could be modified to some extent by the
conditions of nutrition of the plants.  Addition of autoclaved
fructose to the incubation mixture does not affect the activity of
aldolase. The activity of the hexokinases is higher, however, in the
presence of their substrates in the extraction mixtures.<p>
