<h2>Indirect measures of embryo development in interspecific crosses</h2><p>

According to MULLER (1963) the testa of the Arabidopsis seed colours
brownish as soon as the pollen tube enters the embryo sac.  This
discoloration happens even without embryo development, but only after
fertilization. Without fertilization the ovule collapses into a white
mass of tissue. For an early determination of seed setting as well as
for analyses of the basis of interspecific incompatibilities between
species related to Arabidopsis this character proved to be of specidl
interest. Silique elongation was included into the following study on
indrect measures of seed development.<p>

19 different species of the genera Arabidopsis , Cardaminopsis,
Arabis, Cardamine, Sisymbrium and Turritis were combined in 194
different crosses (for details cf. BERGER, 1968).  In most of the
combinations the siliques started ripening under the prevailing
culture conditions 3 weeks after pollination.  At this time the colour
of the ovules and the length of the siliques were determined and
simultaneous paraffin preparations were examined.<p>

The results demonstrated a close correlation between testa coloration
and the stage of the embryogenesis.  It was possible to distinguish
the following 5 different types of seed development:<p>

1.  The ovule is collapsed to a white mass of tissue - the egg cell is
unfertilized;<p>

2.  the testa is light brownish, and only in the region of the chalaza
dark brown - tightly coiled pollen tubes may be observed in the
embryosac of some ovules (3 weeks after pollination!); in other cases
enlarged "zygotes" or proembryos with up to 4 cells are found in the
paraffin sections;<p>

3.  not only the size of the ovule, but also its dark brown colour is
similar to that of normal ripe seeds - the embryo, however, does not
pass over the juvenile stage of a globular embryo;<p>

4.  the outward appearance equals to the foregoing stage 3; the ovule
is definitely not collapsed - the included embryo is "heart-shaped"
with the cotyledons clearly differentiated;<p>

5.  the seed is fully developed, its coat normal brown - the embryo
reaches its final shape.<p>

As another criterion for seed setting the final length of the silique
was used. The figure shows the dependence of the silique length on the
number of the fertilized ovules.  It was interesting to note that the
elongation of the silique - similar to seed coat coloration - was only
induced by fertilization and independent of any further development of
the embryos.<p>

In addition to the results obtained in studies on pollen tube growth
(BERGER, 1966; 1968) the compatibility between Arabidopsis and 18
related species was determined with the aid of these 3 criteria: ovule
coloration, silique length, and final stage of embryo development.<p>
