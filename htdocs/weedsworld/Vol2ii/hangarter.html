Environmental factors such as light, gravity, temperature, 
and
touch provide essential information that serves to modulate 
plant growth
and development so that plants can continuously adjust 
to their
surroundings.  Of these environmental stimuli, light 
is particularly
important because it regulates nearly all stages of 
development beyond
supplying energy for photosynthesis.  Examples of light-regulated
development include germination, stem growth, leaf and 
root development,
tropic responses, chloroplast development, branching, 
and flower induction.
These light-regulated processes are mediated by several 
classes of
photoreceptors, including the phytochromes, blue-light 
receptors, and UV
receptors.  Often, the same process is controlled by 
more than one
photoreceptor system and, therefore, the growth response 
that occurs is the
result of the coordinated action of multiple sensory 
systems.  Moreover,
many light-regulated responses are also modulated by 
other environmental
stimuli and are dependent on endogenous organ, tissue, 
and cell-specific
factors in controlling gene expression and physiology. 
 Thus, plants seem
to use a complex signal transduction network to fine-tune 
their responses
to inputs received from a range of stimuli.  Genetic 
and molecular studies
of light-dependent responses in Arabidopsis are providing 
important
insights into the nature of this 'environmental sensory 
network'.<P>

Although much is known about the biochemistry and molecular 
biology
of the phytochrome family of photoreceptors, the mechanism 
of action of
phytochromes has remained elusive.  Several presentations 
described
interesting approaches that suggest that an understanding 
of phytochrome
action may be within reach.  It has generally been assumed 
that the
phytochromes are cytoplasmic proteins but in two posters, 
Akira Nagatani
and Kojo Sakamoto presented compelling evidence from 
immunochemical and
GUS-PHYB fusion protein experiments suggesting that 
PHYB is localized in
the nucleus.  These findings raise the intriguing possibility 
that
phytochromes may express their regulatory activities 
in the nucleus.
Several laboratories have been using transgenic approaches 
to map the
functional regions of the phytochrome protein.  Experiments 
presented by
Dorris Wagner, R.M. Kuhn and P.H. Quail using overexpressed 
hybrid
phytochrome A and B constructs in Arabidopsis indicate 
that the N-terminal
domains of phytochromes A and B determine the photosensory 
specificity of
the photoreceptors.  In addition, mutational analyses 
of overexpressed
phytochromes indicate that a small region of the C-terminal 
domain is
critical for regulatory activity.  Results from tobacco 
plants (presented
by Emily Jordan et al) overexpressing a number of small 
deletion mutants of
oat phytochrome A indicate that the N terminus contains 
two functional
domains: one confers conformational stability and the 
other is involved in
attenuating the response of active phytochrome.  The 
Yeast two-hybrid
system was used to identify gene products that interact 
with a C-terminal
fragment of phytochrome B (Ted Elich and Joanne Chory). 
 A single clone
that specifically interacted with the PHYB bait was 
isolated and has been
designated PIP for Phytochrome-Interacting-Protein. 
 A full-length PIP cDNA
was isolated and plants overexpressing an antisense 
PIP cDNA exhibited
several phenotypes that are opposite of those in phyB 
mutants.  Others have
been isolating suppressor mutants of hy2 and hy3.  The 
availability of a
potential reaction partner of PHYB (PIP) and several 
interesting suppressor
mutants opens new doors to studies of phytochrome signal 
transduction.<P>

Blue light perception systems are also critical regulators 
of plant
development.  Margaret Ahmad and Tony Cashmore presented 
recent finding on
the molecular and biochemical characterization of the 
recently cloned blue
light photoreceptor, HY4.  Molecular studies indicate 
that the HY4 gene
evolved from a DNA photolyase gene: HY4 has strong structural 
similarities
and shares the same blue-light absorbing chromophores. 
 Photobiological
analysis of a number of allelic mutants show that some 
mutations affect the
action spectrum and absorption spectrum in similar ways, 
thus, showing that
HY4 is a functional blue light photoreceptor.  Because 
HY4 can carry out
blue-light-dependent redox reactions, it's mode of action 
is expected to be
unique from that of the phytochromes.  Myeon Cho and 
Edgar Spalding found
that an early response to blue light is a transient 
depolarization of the
plasma membrane in Arabidopsis hypocotyl cells.  The 
depolarization begins
within a few seconds and precedes the rapid inhibition 
of elongation caused
by blue light.  Their results indicate that the depolarization 
is caused by
an anion channel that could be blocked by the channel 
blocker, NPPB.
Moreover, the depolarization response is greatly attenuated 
in the hy4
mutant.  Because the depolarization response is extremely 
rapid and
dependent on HY4, the anion channel may play a crucial 
role in
blue-light-regulation of cell elongation in Arabidopsis 
hypocotyls.  In
addition to the results on HY4, Dr. Ahmad presented 
data suggesting that
blue light responses require the action of phytochrome 
since hy1phyA and
phyAphyB double mutants appeared to lack blue-light-dependent 
inhibition of
hypocotyl elongation.  Although coaction between phytochrome- 
and
blue-light-dependent responses has been observed in 
other species, earlier
work had suggested that the phytochrome and blue-light 
sensory systems work
largely independently.<P>

In addition to studies on the photoreceptors and early 
events in
the light-dependent-sensory network, downstream components 
are also being
investigated.  Mutants that exhibit photomorphogenic-like 
development in
the absence of light (e.g., det and cop mutants) are 
providing interesting
insights into the mechanisms controlling these processes. 
 Many of the loci
encode regulatory proteins which act as suppressors 
of photomorphogenesis
in the absence of light signals.  Ning Wei and others 
from Xing Wang Deng's
lab presented recent results that indicate that the 
COP9 gene product is a
component of a large protein complex that includes at 
least the COP8 and
COP11 gene products.  Immunochemical and GUS-COP9 localization 
indicate
that the complex is located in the nucleus.  It appears 
that COP9, together
with COP8 and COP11, constitute part of a novel regulatory 
complex
mediating light-dependent control of plant development. 
 Evidence was
presented by von Armin et al suggesting that the COP1 
protein moved between
the nucleus and cytoplasm in a light-dependent manner 
but it is not known
if COP1 interacts with the nuclear-localized COP9 complex. 
 The DET1 gene
 also encodes a novel nuclear encoded protein that acts 
to suppress
photomorphogenesis in darkness (D. Poole, R. Cook and 
J. Chory).  DET1
expression is not regulated by light and it is suggested 
that its activity
is regulated post-transcriptionally.  All of these gene 
products appear to
be essential downstream components that are involved 
in coordinating
developmental responses to the phytochrome and blue-light 
sensory systems
and, thus, represent key nodes in the environmental 
sensory network.<P>

In an attempt to get at genes that may be involved in 
other parts
of the environmental sensory network, Nobuyoshi Mochizuki 
and Joanne Chory
have been isolating and characterizing mutants that 
express CAB3-promoter
reporter genes independently of chloroplast development 
(gun mutants).
Five complementation groups have been identified and 
some of them appear
function as part of an intracellular regulatory pathway 
that is involved in
coordinating the expression nuclear and plastid-encoded 
genes during
plastid development.  Thus, the GUN genes seem to represent 
a specific
branch of a complex interorganellar regulatory network 
that is an important
part of the overall network regulating light-dependent 
development.
Another important component of the environmental sensory 
network is its
coordination with circadian regulation.  Andrew Millar 
et al showed that
circadian period and phase shifting are controlled by 
phytochrome and
blue-light receptor systems.  Moreover, the amplitude 
of light-dependent
CAB2 transcription is dependent on the phase of the 
circadian clock.   Hai
Hong Zhong et al found that the Arabidopsis CAT3 gene 
is negatively
regulated by phytochrome and that the phytochrome response 
is mediated
indirectly through the circadian clock.<P>

Although this summary is not inclusive (many other interesting
findings related to light dependent developmental responses 
were presented
at the conference), it is clear that plants use a complex 
signal
transduction network to fine-tune their responses to 
inputs received from a
multitude of photoreceptor systems.  It is also clear 
that Arabidopsis is
playing a central role in elucidating the complex machinery 
of the
light-dependent sensory-response network.<P>
