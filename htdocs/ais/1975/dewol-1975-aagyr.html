Successful cloning defined as a multiplication of an identical
genotype to an indefinite number of fully developed copies has been
achieved so far by REINHOLZ, E. (1972).  She obtained vegetative
reproduction by shifting plants from the generative to the vegetative
phase applying short day conditions.  Flower buds thus developed a
small leaf rosette. When these rosettes were planted in soil and
exposed to long day conditions, they gave rise to normal
inflorescences. Since we did not succeed in repeating REINHOLZ result
with genotypes at our disposal another approach, starting from
Arabidopsis cuttings, was attempted.<p>

Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh race "Go"-o" were grown under long day
conditions (19 h artificial light per day) at 21*degrees*C +/-
1*degree*C and a relative humidity between 90% and 70%. The minimal
medium is basically that of HOAGLAND and ARNON (JACOBS 1964)
supplemented with 0,5% glucose, 2,5 ppm fungicide (carbendal) and
solidified with 0,8% agar. Shoot cuttings were collected at the time
the petals were distinctly visible or fully open and taken just above
the rosette leaves, while the shoot leaves were facultatively
eliminated.<p>

In our experiments a synthetic auxine, PRB-8 (ORTHONIL or *gamma*
chloro *beta* (3-chloro-o-tolyl)-propionitrile) was used since its
assimilation is considerbly higher compared to other growth regulators
(DIERICKX, P.J., VENDRIG, J.D., 1973, 1974).<p>

Cuttings held under the above mentioned conditions and continuously
exposed to 5 ppm PRB-8 showed callus and root development respectively
after two and three weeks.  When the cuttings were held in a double
strength PBB-8 solution for a 24 hour period, root development was
observed without prior production of callus. Although rooting was not
dependent on the presence of leaves, a direct influence on the rate of
growth became evident.<p>

With respect to reproduction, the further devlopment of the
inflorescence was seen to be dependent upon the phase of florescence
at cutting.  In case the petals became visible at the time of cutting
further growth of the main shoot was completely inhibited, followed by
an abundant proliferation of the lateral shoots.  A different pattern
was observed when the cuttings were taken at a later phase of
florescence. Although the main and lateral shoots showed a further
development, their fructification had been altered. Flower buds
present at the time of cutting grew out without bearing fruits, while
the frucification process appears to be normal through the newly
formed flower buds.<p>

treated with PRB-8 (10 ppm) for 24 hours.<p>

A similar pattern was observed on a lateral shoot cutting.
Consequently, this method may be considered as useful for vegetative
reproduction of Arabidopsis thaliana.<p>
