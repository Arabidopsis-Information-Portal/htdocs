<h2> Concentration - mutagenic relation following dimethylnitrosoamine (DMNA) treatment</h2><p>

(Institute of Experimental Botany, Praha, Czechoslovakia)<p>

Given a 3 hr treatment with DMNA (25*degrees*C), a maximal frequency
of segregating M1 siliquae was found following 300 to 600 mM and then
with an increasing concentration the mutation frequency decreases.
The decrease in the mutation frequency at higher concentrations is
accompanied with a pronounced decrease in germination.  A possible
explanation could be a selective DMNA action, which at higher
concentrations causes a lethality of seeds, which could give mutated
plants.<p>
