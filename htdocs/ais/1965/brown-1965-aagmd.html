Vol 01S: <h2>Lethal, Laggard and Flowering Time Variants in Generations Following Thymidine Analogue Treatment of Arabidopsis Buds</h2><p>

J.A.M BROWN C.R. BHATIA and H. H. SMITH<p>

Reports that competitive 5-halogen analogues of thymidine cause
mutations in microorganisms (FREESE, 1959) led to experiments which
demonstrated that the analogue 5-iododeoxyuridine, (IUdR), was
incorporated into chromosomal DNA of plant root cells (SMITH et al.,
1963).<p>

More recently, it has been shown that I125-labelled IUdR applied to
premeiotic buds of Arabidopsis becomes incorporated selectively into
nuclei of gametophytic cells (BROWN and SMITH, 1964).  Such
incorporation into DNA of cells which are progenitors of gametes is a
prerequisite for the production of sexually transmissable genetic
change in higher plants that can be attributed to the proposed
mechanism of base pair substitution following analogue replacement of
thymidine in DNA (FREESE, 1963). Our observations on Arabidopsis
thaliana progeny populations derived from plants treated with 5-iodo
or 5-bromodeoxyuridine, (IUdR or BUdR), were aimed at detecting any
visible changes due to genetic alteration induced by such treatments.
Deviations from the control populations were readily discernable under
the uniform conditions of growth obtained.<p>

Materials and Methods<p>

Surface sterilized dry seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana race "Estland"
were planted aseptically on mineral agar (0.78%) in individual 15 x
150 mm Pyrex culture tubes closed with glass caps designed to
facilitate gas exchange between the tube and the outside while
maintaining asepsis. After cold treatment (2-4*degrees*C for 1-5
days), such cultures were transferred to controlled environment
chambers and grown at either 24*degrees*C or 25*degrees*C +/-
0.5*degrees*C under continuous illumination of ca. 800 ft-c provided
either by General Electric "slim-line" fluorescent and incandescent
lamps, or a combination of Sylvania "cool white" and "Gro-lux"
fluorescents.<p>

The progeny populations observed were derived from seed set on plants
treated with IUdR or BUdR while in the bud stage; 10-20 *micro* l of a
5 x 10-4 M solution of either analogue, combined with 0.1% "Tween 20"
as a wetting agent, were applied by microsyringe directly to the bud
region of plants 12-14 days after sowing. The treated generation
is designated as T1 and subsequent ones as T2, T3, etc.<p>

Results:<p>

In two independently conducted studies we have noted that the progeny
of normal Arabidopsis plants derived from seed produced on plants
treated with either IUdR or BUdR contain a high frequency of lethal or
laggard seedlings compared to control populations established at the
same time using identical procedures. This result is shown in Table 1,
and again in Figure 1. These lethal and laggard types are the only
gross variants detected.<p>

The lethal laggard phenotype germinates simultaneously with normal
plants but does not grow beyond the cotyledon stage, becomes chlorotic
and evantually dies. The viable laggard phenotype, after normal
germination, lags in development of rosette leaves by from 6 to more
than 12 days, but once the retarded leaf initiation commences, growth
continues and in a proportion of such plants flowering occurs and
apparently normal seed is set. Viable and lethal laggard seedlings are
illustrated in Figure 1 as they appear 13 days after germination; in
normal plants after 13 days both leaf and bud formation has occurred.<p>

seed set on plants treated with 5 x 10-4M BUdR<p>

Figure 2A illustrates that if the laggard phenotypes are discarded
before flowering their frequency declines in each succeeding
generation of selection for normal plants. The second generation data
are based on control and "treatment-derived" populations of 320 plants
each and the third and fifth generations involve 450 plants of each
category per generation. Figure 2B demonstrates that repeated bud
treatments with 5- iododeoxyuridine, alternating between one genertion
of selection for normal plants, causes the frequency of laggards to
increase in the generation following treatment and nullifies the
effect of selection for normal progeny. These data summarize results
obtained with 450 plants in each group per progeny generation.<p>

Because some "viable laggard" plants flower and produce seed, it is
possible to select for the "laggard" phenotype. The criteria for
classification and the percentage of normal and laggard types in
progeny from normal plants grown from seed set on plants treated with
5- bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR) is shown in Table 2. The frequency of
third generation lethal and viable laggards in progeny derived from
first generation BUdR-treated plants is clearly much greater than that
of the control progeny, even though the parental second generation
plants in both cases were normal. Table 1 summarizes the details
contained in Table 2. There were 280 seeds sown in the "BUdR-derived"
group together with 60 controls.<p>

The viable laggards that provided seed were selected and sown for the
purpose of demonstrating a response to selection and to establish a
further generation from which it was hoped a "pure line" of uniform
viable laggard phenotype might be obtained as the starting point for
genetic and biochemical analyses.<p>

Criteria for classification and percentages of each type in control
and "BUdR-derived" lines are shown in Table 3. It is evident that
selection of viable laggard phenotypes as parents resulted in a large
increase in the proportion of laggards in the fourth generation
progeny. Details of the family lines and numbers of control plants
versus plants in the "BUdR-derived" class are shown in Table 4.
Control progeny numbered 110 compared with 80 "BUdR-derived" progeny.<p>

seed set on control and IUdR treated plants. A, following single
treatment; B, following treatment in alternate generations.<p>

The results of a further generation of selection for the viable
laggard phenotype are shown in Table 5. Hetrogeneity among the various
lines exists, but the overall percentage of laggards, which is 50%,
again shows an increase, and in 2 of the 12 derived lines all progeny
were "laggard". The control population of 80 plants has, in contrast,
only 5% of the progeny classed as laggards. Circumstances have not yet
permitted further analysis of progeny from these selections derived
from BUdR treatments, but the response to selection obtained in this
experiment, combined with the data obtained on laggard progeny
following IUdR treatment, indicates a possible genetic component to
the laggard effect induced by the analogue treatment.<p>

Selection for early and late flowering was carried out among normal
progeny following treatment of plants with IUdR. The first 20
seeds to ripen from the treated buds were harvested, and 15 were
planted for the next generation. The number of days to opening of the
first flower bud was the criterion of flowering time; and all
observations were made between 10:30 a.m. and noon. Early and late
flowering plants were selected in 15 families of 10 plants each,
giving 150 "IUdR- derived" plants per generation in each selection
group for comparison with an equal number of selected and unselected
controls. Means and variances for each generation are given in Tables
6 and 7, while the distribution of the 15 family means in each
selection group is illustrated in Figure 3.<p>

The data show that selection following IUdR treatment shifted the mean
toward lateness; but this result was not significant at the 5% level.
The majority of the increases in variance were, however, significant
at either the 1 or 5% level following single (Table 6) or cyclic
treatment (Table 7). The F ratio of the larger to smaller variance was
used to test for significant differences between the variation in
treated derivatives versus unselected controls. In general, the
variance appeared to decrease in selected generations of inbreeding
following a single treatment with IUdR; and to increase in successive
generations of selection and inbreeding following treatment of
alternate generations with IUdR. Comparative data for the unselected
control shows no obvious trend in changes in variance from one
generation to another.  However, the selected control group (Table 6)
did have significantly higher variances than the unselected control in
the early and in the late flowering selections of the second
generation, as well as in the third generation of the early flowering
selections. Although there was no statistically significant shift of
family means in any of the selected lines, the bias was toward
lateness in all, and this was most pronounced in those that were
treated with IUdR and were selected for lateness.<p>

Discussion:<p>

The data show that treatment of Arabidopsis buds with the thymidine
analogues IUdR and BUdR increased the frequency of "laggards" in the
progeny of treated plants. The laggard phenotype also arises in
untreated control populations but with comparatively low frequency,
and possibly due to environmental stresses which lead to malfunction
in embryo development. The increase in frequency of laggards in
progeny derived from treated plants could be due either to
physiological effects of the analogue treatment or to a breakdown in
matabolic processes which is of genetic origin. The observed increase
in laggard frequency following selection for the laggard phenotype and
the decrease in frequency following selection for normal plants
strongly suggests a genetic basis for the phenomenon.<p>

It has not yet been possible to stabilize an inbred line which breeds
true for laggard phenotype. Segregation in the T5 generation grown
from self-pollinating T4 viable laggards gave on an average, 58.6%
laggards; although in two families, of 10 plants each, no normal
plants occurred (Table 5). Some possible explanations for the genetic
results so far obtained are: 1) the viable laggard phenotype is the
expression of a heterozygous condition; 2) many genes are involved and
the approach to homozygosity slow; and 3) the laggard phenotype is of
low penetrance under the environmental condition imposed in these
experiments.<p>

In so far as the laggard phenotype is a gene controlled phenomenon it
may be interpretable as a biochemical mutant governed by one or a few
base pair alterations in the normal DNA. These changes in code may in
turn give a less efficient mechanism for synthesis of new proteins and
enzymes which are in particular demand as the young seedling reaches
the sensitive stage for de novo syntheses required for true
autotrophic growth in a higher plant. The viable laggard may be viewed
as one in which the products requisite for normal growth are
eventually accumulated, but at a slow rate. The lethal laggard as one
in which the rate of synthesis of constituents vital for growth is
"too little or too late".<p>

We know of no published evidence, at present, that analogues of DNA
precursors cause mutations in higher plants, though they have been
proven by a number of investigators to be mutagenic in bacteria and
bacteriophage. Recently 2-aminopurine has been shown to increase the
frequency of adenine-3 mutants in Neurospora (BROCKMAN and DeSERRES,
1963), and there is indirect evidence that 5-bromouracil causes
mutations in platid DNA in Euglena (SCHER and COLLINGE, 1965)<p>

Our selection experiments were based on the idea that at the molecular
level the so-called micromutations governing quantitative characters
may be attributable to an alteration in the rate of enzyme synthesis
or to a modification of the rate of enzyme catalyzed reactions brought
about by a change in enzyme structure. Depending on the character,
this could be controlled by a single cistron or, more likely, by a
number of effective factors located thoroughout the chromosomes.  The
expression of the mutant form would depend largely on the extent of
base pair change in the DNA of the viable zygotes produced by the
treated plants. Considering all the factors involved and the number of
DNA strands per chromosome, the probablility of a single base pair
change in a cistron being finally expressed as a mutant phenotype
appears to be rather low, except for lethals. The high frequency of
laggard phenotypes perhaps represents protein alterations more drastic
than changes involving only single amino acids. Thus, to realize base
analogue-induced phenotypic mutants in higher plants, it seems
important to have "enough" base pair changes accumulated in each
cistron in viable zygotes. Our results so far are only an indication
that by repeated analogue treatment and continuous selection, altered
phenotypic expression, characterized by a genetic component, can be
obtained. It may be possible by further repetition of analogue
treatment and further accumulation of nucleotide changes over several
generations, to achieve viable changes of greater magnitude, to define
the biochemical blocks, and to make genetic analyses of the induced
heritable changes.<p>

Summary<p>

In two independent experiments, treatment of buds with 5-halogen
anologues of thymidine-5-iodo- or bromodeoxyuridine increased the
frequency of laggards in the progeny of treated plants.  Selection for
normal phenotype resulted in a decrease in the number of laggards
while selection for the laggard phenotype increased their frequency.
There was an increase in variance for flowering time in progeny of
normal IUdR treated plants. Treatment of buds with IUdR in alternate
generations resulted in an increased number of laggards and also
showed a further increase in variance for flowering time.  Selection
for early and late flowering variants showed a slight but not
statistically significant response toward lateness.<p>

Discussion:<p>

REDEI: If you use conventional genetic terms, what would you call
these laggards, "Dauermodifikationen" or small mutations?<p>

BROWN: We really can only say that they are apparently mutants. To use
the word mutant in the strictest sense we have to obtain a homozygous
line, and in a cross to a wild type remove the mutant phenotype in the
F1, and then recover it again in the subsequent generation and show it
to persist as a pure line. So indeed classical genetic analysis is
necessary with any phenotype in order to say without doubt, this is a
mutant. These phenotypes we can at least say are "presumptive"
mutants, and that is the strongest word.<p>

REDEI: If you self normal types, do you get laggards segregating in
later generations?<p>

BROWN: Yes. In small percentage of the control population you find
such laggard seedlings, but we hae not been able to get seed to
provide an extra control from these spontaneous laggards in the
control populations, since none have survived to flower. Selection for
normals gives progeny with no greater laggard frequency than the
spontaneous frequency found in controls (J.A.M. BROWN and H.H. SMITH:
Mutation Res.  1, 45-53, 1964).<p>

REDEI: This is interesting from another standpoint. These various
laggard defects were induced by the base analogues, and several
generations were needed to stabilize them. With this material one may
test whether there are multiple strands in the genic DNA which would
need time to sort out transversely. Laggards may or may not be
homozygotes in all parallel lines. This may yield information on the
mechanism of delayed mutation or delayed expression of mutation.<p>

BROWN: I wonder whether you could comment also on the following point:
How can one isolate a biochemical mutant in the 3rd generation, if you
do not know the final expression of the phenotype: Maybe the
biochemical mutant may grow when you supplement it with some
metabolite, but then it might also grow after a lag, without the
supplement. But you cannot tell in this segregating generation whether
these seedlings really require a biochemical supplement.<p>

REDEI: Well, you do not need necessarily biochemical mutants for this.<p>

BROWN: In different experiments we have treated buds with EMS or used
gamma-irradiation of buds and found in populations of equivalent size
to those discussed here morphological mutants as well as the late
flowering mutant (BROWN, J.A.M.: Genetics 50, 237-238, 1964). However,
with the base analogues we have seen no such visible morphological
mutants, only the laggard phenotypes. Perhaps the visible
morphological mutants arise only by more drastic alterations than
those within a genetic codon, although they are supposed ot be true
gene mutations.<p>

REDEI: Do you think that the label which is incorporated into the
nucleus is incorporated into the genetic material or in genetically
inactive sites?<p>

BROWN: I think you can't say more than that the DNA of the chromosome
is labelled.<p>

REDEI: I am asking this because I do not know of any good chemical
evidence which would support the model for base analogue mutation of
FREESE which is widely accepted or claimed. I only know of the one
important experiment of TRAUTNER, SWARTZ and KORNBERG (Proc.  nat.
Acad.  Sci., Wash. 48, 449-455, 1962) in which replication mistakes in
the presence of bromodeoxyuridine were analysed. The results, obtained
in vitro, do not support the hypothesis of mutational mechanism
suggested on the basis of genetic experiments.<p>

BROWN: Yes. The nearest neighbour analysis did not give a pattern of
base replacement in accordance with the theory of FREESE, but these
authors found that the incorporation of guanine was vastly stimulated.<p>

REDEI: As far as I remember the incorporation of guanine was random,
contrary to the expectation.<p>

BROWN: They used a synthetic adenine-thymine polymer, this replicating
in the presence of all four nucleotide tri-phosphates and the KORNBERG
enzyme and co-factors. If the thymine in the adenine- thymine polymer
was replaced by bromouracil then there was a very significant
incorporation of guanine in the replicating polymer, but not strictly
in accordance with the pairing mechanism proposed by FREESE.  But the
main thing is to change the code of bases, and this is demonstrated in
vitro by this very experiment.<p>

BONOTTO: Did you try the thyidine analogues at different times of the
Arabidopsis life cycle? And do you have an idea on the possible
mechanism of action of these analogues?<p>

BROWN: When the same concentration of analogue is applied to a
vegetative rosette type plant at an early stage the effect of the
analogue is to stimulate development. The concentration stimulating
development of the plant in the vegetative stage does not act in this
way when plants become reproductive. There is a lot of work still to
be done on this. It has been found by some workers in Czechoslovakia
that the analogues of thymine, bromo-uracil, and nitro-uracil have
very peculiar morphological effects when applied to seedlings (Z.
SORMOVA, K.  SEBESTA, J. BAUEROVA, O. MELICHAR, and F. SORM:
Experientia 16, 189, 1960), and this is not completely explained
either. It is not explained by incorporation into DNA, but these
effects are obsreved at a very late stage of development and
treatments were given to very young seedlings.<p>
