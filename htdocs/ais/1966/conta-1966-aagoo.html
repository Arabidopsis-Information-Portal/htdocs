	Nine months old dry and 48 h presoaked Arabidopsis seeds (race Li-2) were given 9 doses of fast neutrons from reactor B.A.R.N. at this institute, from 0 up to the lethal dose for dry seeds; 100 seeds were irradiated per dose, for each of the two treatments.<p>

	Germination, although delayed, still occurs at exceedingly high doses; it bears apparently no relation to survival (germination delay probably does, for a given kind of radiation, but seems a rather unsuitable parameter).  The formation of leaves may be examined under the binocular 6-7 days after germination; the proportion of plantlets forming leaves at that time is a good measure of ultimate survival in this experiment. The shape of the dose/survival curves is typically sigmoid, with a broad shoulder even for soaked seeds. The differences in sensitivity between dry and soaked seed, in respect of survival, are connected more strongly with differences in shoulder width than in the slope of the curve. This stands in contrast to fertility reduction and reduction in root growth, in which the slopes of the curves are markedly different for dry and soaked seed. This illustrates the fact that with fast neutrons % survival is a very inadequate means of predicting fertility.<p>

	The first 40 capsules on the main stem were harvested on each surviving plant; date of harvest was recorded for each capsule.  Mean harvest date was calculated per plant, for the first 10 capsules and for all 40 capsules.  The corresponding dose/harvest-date curves ran entirely parallel and the correlation, for each dose, of (mean harvest date 10 capsules) and (mean harvest date 40 capsules) was almost perfect.  Mean harvest date is delayed linearly with dose or dry seeds, and also for soaked seeds with the exception fo the highest dose (which showed a relatively big delay).  Maximum delay was 17 days for dry seed and 13 days for soaked seed.<p>

	Fertility was determined as the total weight of seeds in the 40 capsules harvested (husks having been carefully sieved out); this weight is 35-40 mg per unirradiated plant.  With increasing dose, fertility decreases sharply; soaked seeds were as usual more sensitive than dry seeds.  On linear scales, comparison of the curves is not easy.  Very satisfactory linearity was obtained, however, when log(dose) is plotted against fertility-reduction expressed as a percentage of the control fertility, on log/probability paper.  Consequently, the dose/fertility-reduction curves can be completely characterized by the log(dose) value at the median effective dose 50%= "log ED 50" and the slope (b) of the line.  Dose may be expressed in neutrons/cm2 or, in our case, where fast neutron fluxes are not yet precisely known, in units of exposure time for a rigorously standardised experimental setup.  Sensitivity comparisons may thus be made by (1) calculating the ratio of the ED 50 (soaked) /ED 50 (dry) = ).63 and (2) by calculating the ratio of b (comparative treatment)/b (standard treatment), which for this experiment was b (soaked)/b(dry)=1.269.  The latter value gives the ratio of the standard deviations of the distributions or, in other words, the relative increase in effect per unit dose for the comparative treatment (FINNEY, 1964).  The confidence interval for both ratios can be calculated.<p>

	The transformation discussed here has been applied to many data from fast and thermal neutron irradiations, on several species, and was in all cases found to be very satisfactory, although it still seems impossible to explain satisfactorily the biological significance of the log(dose) transformation. The possibilities for application of techniques of probit analysis to radiation-dose/response relationships is at present being studied.<p>
