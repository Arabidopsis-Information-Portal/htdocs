Arabidopsis can be cultured by a wide variety of aseptic techniques
using whole plants, isolated organs or tissues (cf. REDEI, 1970).<p>

In aseptic media the plants are generally supported by agar or
perlite.  NEALES (1968) grew isolated roots in liquid media, however.
Methods for growing intact higher plants under aseptic conditions in
liquid submerged culture do not seem to be available (cf. KLEIN,
1970).<p>

In the past years we successfully grew Arabidopsis in liquid culture.
The basic mineral solution is the same as generally used (REDEI, 1965)
and with 2% glucose added this constitutes the "minimal" nutrient
medium. From this liquid 80 ml is distributed to 250 ml Erlenmeyers,
then plugged and autoclaved. After cooling 30 seeds (disinfected by
treatment with 5% calcium hypochlorite for 8 min and washed with 4-5
changes of sterile distilled water) are dropped into each flask under
aseptic conditions. The Erlenmeyers are placed on a slow moving
reciprocating shaker to insure sufficient aeration.  Under such
conditions the plants grow more rapidly than on agar. The improved
growth can be attributed to the fact that a large surface of the
plants is exposed to the nutrients and apparently the uptake through
the leaves is very efficient. The growth of the roots is remarkably
good in such submerged cultures. This technique seems very promising
for investigations on nutrition through the leaves of intact plants, a
problem of interest for plant physiologists and agronomists (cf.
BOYTON, 1954; WITTWER and TAUBNER, 1959; SARGENT, 1965; FRANKE, 1967;
EPSTEIN and JEFFERIES, 1964), but difficulty to study on plants of
large size. The generally used spray techniques are hard to
quantitate, besides leaf burns often occur because of the evaporation
of the solvents.<p>

This type of culture also facilitates the eocnomical, aseptic
production of fair quantities of plant material for biochemical
analyses.<p>
