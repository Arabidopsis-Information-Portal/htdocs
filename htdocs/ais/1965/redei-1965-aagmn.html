VANDENDRIES in 1909 published a beautiful treatise on the embryology
of some crucifers including Arabidopsis thaliana (Sisymbrium
thalianum).  According to his observations the young ovule contains a
multicellular archesporium in which only a single archesporial cell
(cellule parimordiale) enlarges and develops into a functional
megaspore mother cell (cellule-mere definitive).  My observations on
our Columbia wild type are in complete agreement with his description.
In a material containing factor Gf also a different type of
differentiation was observed.  In some ovules not single megaspore
mother cells but twin sporocytes were present, rarely even twin
embryosacs devloped.  According to VANENDRIES in Cardamine pratensis
and Sisymbrium taraxacifolium multiple tetrads are formed regularly in
each ovule; only one embryosac develops however.  It appears that the
pattern of megasporogenesis may be under a relatively simple genetic
control.  In Arabidopsis thalianum (GAY) & MONN.) from Saharanpur,
India, single- celled archesporium was reported by MISRA (1962).  It
would be interesting to know whether this is really a new type of
megasporogenesis or just information on the earliest stages has not
been collected.  If the type of sporocyte development is different
from that observed first by VANDENDRIES, the genetic basis of the
difference would be of interest from evolutionary point of view.<p>
