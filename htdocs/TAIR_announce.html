<blockquote>

 Dear Arabidopsis researchers,

 <P>We are pleased to announce the inception of The Arabidopsis
 Information Resource (TAIR), which assumed responsibility for
 Arabidopsis information from AtDB on September 1st, 1999. TAIR is a
 collaborative effort between the Carnegie Institution of Washington,
 Department of Plant Biology, at Stanford, California, and the National
 Center for Genome Resources (NCGR) at Santa Fe, New Mexico.

 <P>TAIR will expand and improve on AtDB to include comprehensive
sequence and map information, community information (people, labs,
companies, and databases), expression data, and experimental data from the
literature. We also plan to improve the interfaces with considerable
input from users. Anyone interested in more information regarding this
project, please see <a href="/TAIR_proposal.html"><B>TAIR proposal</B></a>


 <P>Our goal is to ensure that the users of AtDB will not be negatively
affected by the transition to TAIR. We will implement this plan in the
following ways:
<ol>
 <li>Full-time curators at AtDB have transferred to TAIR and will continue to
address questions and suggestions sent to atdb-curator and atdb-suggest;

<P>
 <li> The AtDB Web pages and database will continue to be hosted by the
Stanford Department of Genetics until a comparable site is set up and
tested at NCGR. The Web pages will be hosted by NCGR by Nov 1st, 1999
and data in AtDB's database will be available from NCGR by Jan 15th, 2000;

<P>
 <li> The interfaces and structure of the web pages of TAIR will evolve
from those of AtDB in an incremental manner. The changes and new
tools will be tested by a focus user group, followed by announcement
on our home page and to the Arabidopsis newsgroup. Older versions will
remain for a few weeks after the public release of the new versions;

<P>
 <li> Starting November 1st, 1999, TAIR will host the Web pages, map
displays, updates of sequence datasets, and sequence analysis programs
at NCGR, including BLAST and FASTA. TAIR will link to Stanford for data
in AtDB's database. Stanford will keep up the previous Web pages for a
few weeks and then start redirecting to TAIR's home page. Please edit
your bookmarks at your earliest convenience.
<P>
 <li> Data in AtDB's database will be transferred to TAIR and
the new interfaces will be released by January 15th, 2000. AtDB's database will be
available until all the data are in TAIR and have been released to the
public for some time.
</ol>
 <P>We will notify the community of any updates and changes of TAIR using
the Arabidopsis newsgroup mailing list and on AtDB's home page.  If you have any
questions, concerns, or comments regarding this transition, please contact
us at:

<a href="mailto:curator@arabidopsis.org"><B>curator@arabidopsis.org</B></a>

 <P>For more information please see <a href="/"><B>TAIR</B></a>


<P> We would like to thank Mike Cherry, PI of the AtDB project, for
 graciously agreeing to continue hosting the AtDB site beyond the end
of AtDB's funding, until a comparable site is created and tested at
TAIR. We would also like to thank Mike and his staff at AtDB for their
contribution to the project to date.

 <P>Best Regards,

 <P>Sue Rhee, Carnegie  -Director
<br>Eva Huala, Carnegie -Head Curator
<br>Margarita Garcia-Hernandez, Carnegie -Curator
<br>Allan Dickerman -NCGR Project Leader
<br>Don Kiphart, NCGR -IT Architect  
<br>Andrew Farmer, NCGR -Database administrator
<br>Chris Town, TIGR -Exec. Committee
<br>David Meinke, Oklahoma State U. -Exec. Committee
<br>Bruno Sobral, NCGR -PI
<br>Chris Somerville, Carnegie -PI
