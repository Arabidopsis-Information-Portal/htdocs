The adaptive value of a genotype represents a relative measure of
Darwinian fitness expressing the mean number of descendants left by
the representatives of this genotype as compared with another
(reference) genotype. At least two components take part in
constituting fitness: the ability to survive from zygote to adult, and
the fertility of the latter. The two compoennts can be also given in
relative units as relative viability and relative fertility,
respectively.  In spite of this, relative viablilities were often
substituted for adaptive values (cf. Allard, Jain and Workman, 1968).
In Arabidopsis thaliana, Cetl and Plchova (1975) attempted to express
the adaptive value, w, as a product of relative viability, v, and
relative fertility, f:w = vf.<p>

Seven artificial populations each of them carrying one recessive
allele for a certain visible mutation, m, were established.  In the
generation t = O, seeds were harvested from m+m heterozygotes so that
po = qo = .5 and Ho = 1 (cf. Cetl, 1976).  In the next generation,
t=1, relative viabilities, v1 and v2, and relative fertilities, f1 and
f2, were measured in four replications with 200 seeds sown in each by
means of the survival rates and the seed numbers in the two
homozygotes, m+m+ and mm, respectively, and expressed in relative
units as compared with the heterozygote, m+m.  Because of the
unlimited apical growth of the inflorescences only seed ripening
during 10 days after the harvest of the first pod of the plant were
counted.<p>

Table 1: Relative viabilities, v1 and v2, relative fertilities, f1 and
f2, and adaptive values, w1 and w2, in the homozygotes m+m+ and mm,
respectively, in artificial populations carrying the recessive allele
m for a visible mutation.<p>

Relative viabilities, relative fertilities, and adaptive values in the
two homozygotes are given in Table 1.  It is evident that there is no
clear relation between the viability and fertility in particular
populations. Thus relative viability by itself cannot be used in
predicting the further development of the population.<p>

The adaptive values of the dominant homozygote were generally twice
compared with those of the recessive homozygote.  In five populations
(with mutant alleles L, lc, lc(S), ln, and chm3) transitional
polymorphism might be expected on the basis of theoretical
considerations for one locus (Cetl, 1976).  It means that heterozygote
advantage seems to be wide-spread in Arabidopsis not only in the
genetic systems with lethal chlorophyll mutations (Cetl and Plchova,
1975) but also in those with visible mutations.<p>

It seems that the way described for measuring adaptive values in
Arabidopsis is applicable also for other plant species.<p>
