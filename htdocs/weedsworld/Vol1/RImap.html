<H2>Updated version of the RFLP map generated on Landsberg erecta x 
Columbia Recombinant Inbred lines.</H2>

<hr>

    An updated version of this map was released on 26/9/94 and is included in the latest release of AAtDB. <P>
    The map gives the position of 379 RFLP markers. There are a 
few changes in the order of previously mapped markers compared 
with the last map (June 1994). This is partly as a result of the 
addition of 43 new markers, but also in the random way in which 
"Mapmaker" selects markers to produce an order. Also we must 
apologise for a few mistakes in marker names on the previous map 
and hope this has not caused too much confusion! <P>

    A drawn map has not in fact been produced, instead a list of 
the marker orders and the cM distances to the next marker are 
shown. The maps for Chromosomes 1, 2, 3 and 5 have been 
generated completely using "Mapmaker". For Chromosome 4 we have 
used the physical map data, from Renate Schmidt and her 
co-workers, to create the framework for the map around which the 
new markers have been positioned. <P>

    The accuracy of the map is determined by several factors, 
the most important of which is the quality of the segregation 
data submitted. Secondly, the use of 100 lines means that 
recombination events between closely linked markers are becoming 
limiting. <P>

    To obtain either a hard copy or an e-mailed copy of the map 
please contact Mary Rayward-Smith at ARABIDOPSIS@BBSRC.AC.UK
Any enquiries about markers on the map should also be directed 
to ARABIDOPSIS. <P>

    The next new map will be produced in time for the Plant 
<a href="gopher://probe.nalusda.gov/00/.plant/.pg3.txt">Genome III meeting</a> in January. <P>
<B> Please send your segregation data to LISTER@BBSRC.AC.UK</B>
