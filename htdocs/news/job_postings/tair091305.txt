Post-doc: Metabolic networks of Arabidopsis thaliana
Availability: Available immediately.

Job description:


A postdoctoral position is available immediately to study metabolic 
networks of Arabidopsis 
thaliana bioinformatically. S/he will analyze the Arabidopsis 
metabolism database, AraCyc 
(www.arabidopsis.org/tools/aracyc), and Arabidopsis genome annotation 
data at TAIR to identify 
the candidate genes whose function could be best determined by 
metabolite profiling and analyze 
the results of the profiling experiments in the context of the 
metabolic networks in AraCyc. 
The candidate will work with a team of metabolism database curators and 
researchers in leading 
metabolite profiling labs to demonstrate how metabolite profiling can 
enhance our understanding 
of metabolic networks in Arabidopsis and how the systems-level analysis 
of metabolism could 
lead to new insights in plant biology. Some specific tasks include:


developing a set of criteria and a program to select best target genes 
for metabolite profiling 
using genome annotation information in TAIR, pathway data in AraCyc, 
sequence or structure-based 
enzyme prediction methods, and information in the literature

developing methods to quantitatively and qualitatively compare AraCyc 
pathways with respect to 
gene expression and metabolite profiling data

incorporating metabolites identified from metabolite profiling 
experiments into AraCyc

Applicants should have a Ph.D. in biochemistry, plant biology, 
molecular genetics, bioinformatics or related field.
Experience with programming in Perl or Java and databases such as MySQL 
are a plus.

Carnegie Institution, Dept. Plant Biology, is located on Stanford 
University campus, in the San Francisco Bay Area.

To apply, please email a cover letter, CV and names of three references
