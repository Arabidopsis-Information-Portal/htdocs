<p>Applications are being accepted for a Post-Doctoral Associate -- Biology
    Department in the Laboratory of Jonathan Monroe at James Madison University
    (JMU) beginning August 2013. The research involves investigating the
    functions of a family of beta-amylases in Arabidopsis using expressed
    proteins, T-DNA insertion mutants and measurements of starch metabolism.
    This work is funded through a Research at Undergraduate Institutions (RUI)
    grant from the NSF. Candidates should have a Ph.D. degree in Plant Molecular
    Biology and be seeking a career at a predominantly undergraduate
    institution. Experience with protein-protein interactions is desirable. In
    addition to gaining experience in mentoring undergraduate researchers, the
    postdoc will also undertake some classroom and laboratory teaching in a
    sophomore-level Cell and Molecular Biology course and in an upper-level
    course fitting the background of the postdoc. Travel support is available to
    attend the national conferences of ASPB and the Council on Undergraduate
    Research. The position is offered for one year, with the option to extend
    one additional year.</p>

    The Biology Department at JMU is housed in a new Bioscience building that
    opened fall 2012 (<a href="http://www.jmu.edu/biology/mural.shtml">http://www.jmu.edu/biology/**mural.shtml</a>).
    JMU is located in Harrisonburg, VA, in the heart of the Shenandoah Valley,
    and is about a two-hour drive from Washington, D.C. The area affords many
    opportunities for outdoor recreation, with the George Washington National
