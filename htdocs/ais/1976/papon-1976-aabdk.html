Field investigations and herbarium pattern study have made it possible
in general to outline the area of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. on
the territory of the USSR.  It includes practically all the European
part of this country, the North boundary going along the middle part
of the Karel ASSR, along the banks of the Onega, the North Dvina, near
the city of Kirov, along the central part of the Western foothills of
the Urals.  In the Asian part of the USSR its Eastern bounds lie near
Abakhan, then they go to the South until Afghanistan, in the North the
plants have been found as far as Tobolsk region.<p>

The structures of the populations of the studied species have been
observed stationarily in their natural sites.  Our investigations have
shown that in the Western foothills of the Urals the species is
represented by small centres of reproduction, some of them consisting
of tens, others of thousands of plants. They usually occupy small
plots of tens or hundreds of square metres where one can observe the
changes of the quantity within the years. Thus the characteristic
feature is the scantiness of the territory occupied.<p>

Natural selection at the boundary of the species area promoted the
formation of a number of adaptive modifications such as the ability of
seeds not to germinate during one or two years.<p>

The species is represented in general by ephemeral forms, but
sometimes there occur autumn and winter forms the quantity of which
depends on the location of the population, its size, weather
conditions and microrelief as well.<p>

Modifications of the growth of the overground and root systems may be
adaptive. For example, the seeds of fasciated plants have been
gathered and sown into an experimental plot in the open air and into
the ground with artificial lighting.  Examining the offsprings of a
fasciated plant showed the noninheritance of the feature studied. This
modification has an adaptive character, for fasciated plants in
natural populations are late maturing and this affects the composition
of seasonal races.<p>

The study of the peculiarities of root system grown in crop fields has
shown that the main root will grow in natural associations; in some
instances the main root stops but the lateral roots spread
horizontally in one or several directions on creeping shoots forming
sometimes adventitious roots.<p>

Modificative changes permit the growth of the species under these hard
conditions and changing ecological factors.<p>
