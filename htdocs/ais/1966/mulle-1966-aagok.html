	Simultaneous treatment with NaN3 or KCN has been found to decrease the frequency of mutations induced by nitrosoalkylureas in seeds of Arabidopsis (VELEMINSKY et al., 1965; MULLER, 1965).  Further studies showed that with other mutagenic agents these inhibitors of metabolism have the opposite effect:  They enhance the mutagenic effectivness.  The following table includes data from simultaneous treatments (sim) and from post treatments (post) with NaN3 and KCN.  In all cases presoaked seeds were treated.  Degree of sterility (s) and frequency of recessive lethals were determined by the embryo test.<p>
