Three postdoctoral positions are currently available at the Iowa State University. 

The selected candidates will be able to contribute towards the following research objectives: 
(i) map-based cloning of Arabidopsis nonhost resistance genes and their application in creating 
broad-spectrum and durable disease resistance in soybean; (ii) trans-specific silencing of 
pathogen genes from transgenic soybean plants to retard pathogen's growth for generating disease 
resistance in soybean; (iii) identification of synthetic toxin-interacting peptides and their 
use in creating toxin-insensitive transgenic soybean plants; and (iv) identification and use of 
candidate genes in enhancing disease resistance in transgenic soybean plants. Transgenic soybean 
plants will be developed at the Iowa State University Plant Transformation Facility. Three 
positions for up to 3-5 years funded by USDA-NIFA are currently available. 

Applicants should have strong publication records in the area of molecular genetics and biology. 
Knowledge in the area of plant-pathogen interactions is desirable. Should have a Ph.D. degree in 
plant science, plant pathology or in related areas. Positions will be filled out at earliest 
possible time starting December 1, 2012.
