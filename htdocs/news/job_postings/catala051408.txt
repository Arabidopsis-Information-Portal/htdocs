Postdoctoral Associate Position

      A postdoctoral position is available at the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant 
Research, Ithaca, New York, in the area of auxin homeostasis and signaling in tomato 
fruit development. Two areas of interest in the lab are the control of cell wall 
modification by auxin during rapid cell expansion and the mechanisms of auxin 
synthesis, transport and metabolism during tomato fruit development. Experimental 
approaches will include the use of genomics and proteomics to study the nature of auxin-
regulated signaling networks for cell wall modification and the characterization of auxin 
transport systems in developing fruit.

Requirements:

A Ph.D., and demonstrated experience and expertise in plant molecular biology or plant 
biochemistry are essential. A background in the study of plant hormones or plant cell 
walls would be highly advantageous. Candidates must have strong written and oral 
communication skills

Please send a curriculum vitae, statement of interest and the names and contact 
information of three referees to Dr. Carmen Catalá (cc283@cornell.edu) 
(http://bti.cornell.edu/).
