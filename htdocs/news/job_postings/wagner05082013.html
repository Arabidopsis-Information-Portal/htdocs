    Effective immediately, I am looking for a postdoctoral researcher to
    investigate the regulation of the vital developmental switch to flower
    formation in Arabidopsis. My lab is studying how the plant specific
    transcription factor LEAFY directs floral meristem formation. In addition,
    we are investigating how the onset of flower formation is timed for optimal
    reproductive fitness. We use a combination of genetic, genomic, cell
    biological and molecular approaches to address these questions. More details
    about my lab’s work can be found at <a
        href="http://www.bio.upenn.edu/people/doris-wagner">http://www.bio.upenn.edu/people/doris-wagner</a>.
    The successful candidate should have completed his PhD recently, have a
    strong publication record and prior knowledge of Developmental Biology as
    well as of molecular and genetic approaches. Prior experience in gene
    regulatory networks or computational biology is a plus, but not required.
</p>
<p>The University of Pennsylvania Biology Department has an active Plant
    Biology research group and excellent research facilities. Salary will be
    commensurate with qualifications and experience. The position will be
    initially available for one year, with renewal based on performance and
    funding availability. The successful candidate will be encouraged to apply
    for independent fellowships to gain independent programs for his/her future
    career path.</p>

    Those interested should submit a cover letter (1-2 pages) outlining their
    research interest and career goals, current curriculum vitae, and name and
    contact information of three referees to <a
