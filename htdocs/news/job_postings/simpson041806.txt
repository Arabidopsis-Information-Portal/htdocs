Technician (Grade C): Arabidopsis Flowering

A technical position is available to support studies on the regulation of gene expression 
controlling flower development.
The position, funded by the BBSRC, will involve the production of recombinant clones, 
transformation of Arabidopsis, and high-throughput DNA sequencing.
Candidates should be educated to an appropriate level in a science subject and should 
have 2-3 years relevant laboratory experience. Practical molecular biology experience 
is required (PCR, cloning, DNA sequencing, RNA and DNA gel blot analysis etc). Previous 
experience of working with Arabidopsis would be an advantage, but is not required as 
training would be given. The successful candidate should be highly organized, 
enthusiastic and be able to work as part of an interactive team.

The position will be based in Dr Gordon Simpson's lab, which along with other Dundee 
University Plant Research Labs, is located at the Scottish Crop Research Institute, 
Invergowrie, Dundee.

readers of The Scientist magazine in 2004 and 2005 and the School scored the highest 
possible 5* in the most recent research assessment exercise. Culturally vibrant, with 
easy access to the Highlands and other Scottish cities, Dundee offers one of the 
strongest possible combinations of quality of science with quality of life.

Technician Grade C: £14,372-£16,946. Flexible working hours may be possible:
