*  We have been looking at the timing of pollen abortion in some male 
sterile mutants of Arabidopsis.  Using this procedure it is possible to 
follow the development of pollen mother cells through to mature pollen.  
The male steriles were made using irradiation mutagenesis of Landsberg 
erecta seed (from Maarten Koornneef).  We use buds harvested from 
the primary inflorescence just before bolting.  This is because in our 
hands this material seems to give more consistent results, i.e., 
reasonable chromosome pictures, than buds which develop later.  Buds 
are harvested and fixed from populations which we know will segregate 
male steriles.  Then the plants are allowed to flower and bolt a.second 
time round!  At this stage plants are scored for sterility or fertility.  Then 
we go back to the relevant fixed buds and start looking.

1.  PROCEDURE
  (i) Sow seeds in Petri dishes on a layer of superfine grade Perlite 
(Silvaperl) prewetted with B5 medium (Gamborg, O. L., Miller, R. A.  & 
Ojima, K. (1968) Exp.  Cell.  Res. 50, 151-158).  For further details see 
the "Protocol for Growing Arabidopsis", given in this manual.  Incubate in 
a growth chamber at 21+/-2oC under cool white fluorescent light (1500-
2200 lux). 
  (ii) After 7 d, transplant the seedlings into compost and continue 
growing in the incubator.  The primary inflorescence should be 
harvested 18-20 d after sowing using watchmaker's forceps (size 5A, 
A.R. Horwell).  The critical point is that buds must be harvested before 
bolting begins.
  (iii) Fix the inflorescence in ethanol:acetic acid (3:1) for 24 h then 
transfer to 70% ethanol for storage at 4oC until required.
  (iv) Under a stereomicroscope and using a miniscalpel (e.g., Beaver 
Miniblade No. 65, Wilkinsons, Nottingham) dissect the inflorescence 
bud by bud.  Dissect individual buds in a drop of 45% acetic acid.  
Anthers showing even a hint of yellow colouration will contain fairly 
mature pollen.  Most of the action is thus found in the smaller buds with 
whitish anthers.
  (v) Remove all material apart from anthers.  Carefully remove excess 
acetic acid with a piece of filter paper and immediately add a drop of 1% 
propionic carmine (Sharma, A.K. & Sharma, A. (1980). Chromosome 
Techniques:  Theory and Practice, 3rd edn, 711 pp.  Butterworths, 
London).  Gently tap the prep with a copper rod (or failing that use the 
flat end of a dissecting needle handle) to release cells from anthers.  
Place a cover slip on the prep.  Pass the slide through a spirit-burner 
flame 2-3 x and then apply gentle pressure to the cover slip to squash 
preps for viewing.
  (vi) View and photograph slides (using a green filter for enhanced 
contrast and Ilford FP4 film).  Within the buds obtained from an 
inflorescence you should get pictures of pre-meiotic pollen mother cells, 
meiosis, tetrads, microspores and mature pollen.
