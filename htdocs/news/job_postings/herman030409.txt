Postdoctoral Associate 
 
 
Description 
A postdoctoral position is available immediately to conduct research to investigate the potential to 
express foreign proteins in Camelina, a Brassica with many similarities to Arabidopsis. The 
project will have both basic and translational applied goals consisting of investigating how to 
redirect more of the source nutrient flow to the production of protein and to produce specific 
foreign proteins as a demonstration of the effectiveness of the research progress. The candidate 
will need to be familiar with Arabidopsis molecular biology with construct production, 
transformation and screening that will directly translate to Camelina. The incumbent will need to 
be able to use proteomic analysis to evaluate the output trait. The postdoctoral associate will 
function as a member of a team that will include several postdoctoral associates working toward 
the general goals of investigating the biological processes that control seed storage substance 
accumulation and its use to reconstruct seed composition.
