2-year postdoc position, at LIPM, Toulouse, France__
To study the mode of action of the F-box "GALA" type III effector proteins of 
/Ralstonia solanacearum /on Arabidopsis.

_Location:_
The LIPM (www.toulouse.inra.fr/centre/lipm), in Toulouse, France, is a dynamic 
and international group of researchers studying plant-microbe interactions. It 
provides an excellent scientific environment and facilities to carry out this 
project.

_The Position:_
Together with the project leader, a PhD student and technical assistance 
(protein biochemistry, plant transformation and microscopy facilities), the 
candidate will carry out Arabidopsis molecular genetics, cell biology and E3-
ubiquitine ligase related biochemistry in order to identify and characterize the 
targets of the GALA proteins injected by /R. solanacearum /in plant cells in 
order to understand the contribution of these type III effectors to the 
virulence of this bacterium.

The candidate should have experience, with a proven track record of publication, 
in plant molecular genetics, protein biochemistry and/or cell biology. The 
candidate is expected to have a strong enthusiasm (not necessary previous 
experience) for plant-pathogenic bacteria interactions. Good English scientific 
communication skills are essential.

Annual Gross salary of 25 611 EUR (expected Net salary around 1800 EUR/month 
including health and unemployment benefits).
Starting the 1^st of February 2008 or soon after.

_Application:_
Please send email inquiry and application, with subject header "postdoc GALA", 
to Nemo Peeters (peeters@toulouse.inra.fr <mailto:peeters@toulouse.inra.fr>). 
Application should contain a cover letter outlining previous experience, a 
curriculum vitae and up to three reference contact details.

_Living in Toulouse:_
Fourth largest city in France, Toulouse is attractive in terms of cultural and 
sport activities. The South of France is renowned for its quality of life!
