[Arabidopsis] job posting/postdoctoral position

   A postdoctoral position is available immediately for an NSF2010
   project on “Functional Analysis and Phosphorylation Site Mapping of
   Leucine-Rich Repeat Receptor-Like Kinases in Arabidopsis.”  The
   project will involve studying the biochemical properties of
   recombinant receptor cytoplasmic domains, identifying
   autophosphorylation sites using MALDI-ToF-MS, and investigating
   possible in vitro interactions between kinase domains in pairwise
   combinations (Plant Cell 17: 1685-1703).  Prior experience with
   protein biochemistry, proteomics, mass spectrometry, and expression of
   recombinant proteins is desirable.  Applicants must possess a Ph.D.
   degree in Biochemistry, Biology or Molecular Biology, or closely
   related field, and should have a strong interest in protein
   phosphorylation.  Good interpersonal skills are required for
   exchanging information and maintaining interactions with collaborators
   on the project.  Competitive salary is commensurate with experience
   and qualifications.  The University of Illinois is an equal
   opportunity employer and provider.
   APPLICATION:  E-mail CV, brief summary of research experience,
   interests and professional goals, contact information for three
   references, and approximate availability dates to Steve Huber at
   [1]schuber1@uiuc.edu.
