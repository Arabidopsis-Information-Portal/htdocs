Post Doctoral researcher in plant receptor signaling 
Applications are invited for one PostDoctoral researcher to join the lab 
of Dr Jenny Russinova at the VIB/Department Plant Systems 
Biology/University of Ghent, Ghent, Belgium 
(http://www.vib.be/en/research/scientists/Pages/Jenny-Russinova-Lab.aspx). 
The funding is provided via the "Boost your career in plant 
biotechnology" initiative of the Department 
(http://www.psb.ugent.be/jobs/579-5-postdoctoral-positions). 
The project will take advantage of recent developments in the study of 
endocytic regulation of receptor-mediated signaling pathways in 
Arabidopsis. The aim of the project is to define the molecular machinery 
responsible for endocytic trafficking using proteomics and chemical 
genomics approaches, and generate proof of concept that endocytosis 
contributes to signaling activity in Arabidopsis. 
The applicants must have PhD in cell biology, development or molecular 
biology. A proven record of scientific productivity is obligatory. 
Experience with biochemistry, confocal microscopy, image analysis and 
Arabidopsis genetics will be advantageous. 
Before application, please e-mail your CV including statement of research 
experience and the contact information of three referees to Jenny Russinova 
(0032 933 13931; jenny.russinova@psb.vib-ugent.be).
