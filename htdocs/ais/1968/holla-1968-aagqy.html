Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) HEYNH. was used to investigate the
efficiencies of different plant breeding methods when selecting
simultaneously for two quantitative characters in self pollinated
plants.  Two such easily measured characteristics in Arabidopsis are
flowering time and growth rate.  Measuring flowering time and growth
rate of a single plant (which is necessary in early generations where
heterozygosity is high) rules out to take the standard measure of
growth rate in the exponential phase, namely, log plant fresh weight
at 11 days, as this is preflowering.  BROCK (1967) selected for growth
rate by weighing plants at 22 days, post flowering, and measured and
the response to selection by weighing plants at 11 days.  He found
that this selection technique for early growth rate was not efficient
and warned against its use.  I felt that a better technique would be
to measure the plants' weights as they flowered rather than to measure
them all at the one fixed time after flowering irrespective of their
flowering times, in the hope that the growth rates estimated in this
way would be an index of the growth rates during the exponential
phase.  An experiment to test the usefulness of this technique by
constructing growth curves of several homozygous Arabidopsis lines of
differing flowering times was performed.<p>

Four lines of Arabidopsis were used: Landsberg/Warthe (La), Estland
(Est), and Hannoversch-Munden (Hm), originally from the LAIBACH
collection, and an early flowering mutant of Estland (A136) produced
by Dr. BROCK, C.S.I.R.O.  The mean numbers of days to flowering were:
16.84 (0.15)* for A136, 17.67 (0.12) for La, 19.39 (0.10) for Est, and
25.78 (0.24) for Hm.  Plants were grown aseptically one per test tube
(diameter 1`50mm x 16 mm) in sterile nutrient agar at 25*degrees*C, in
1800 f.c. continuous light, and 65% rel. humid. using the technique
described by LANGRIDGE (1957).  At seeding there was a 7 ml aliquot of
nutrient agar in each tube.  Four plants from each of four replicates
were sampled from each line at a harvest. Due to poor establishment in
some lines there were fewer plants and hence fewer harvests from them.<p>

Arrows indicate flowring times.  &#207;lags below each harvest time
indicate either L.S.D. 5%, or 95% fiducial limits.  Open symbols in
Hm, Est, and La represent data from plants sown on a different date to
the rest of the experiment.<p>

Figure 1 illustrates log whole plant fresh weight measurements.  There
were relatively large error variances in early harvests, probably due
to uneven germination, and these may have masked differences between
lines in these stages. The exponential growth phase ended soon after
14 days for all races.  Final plant weight was ranked according to
flowering time, the latest flowering race being the heaviest, as one
would expect. Growth rates estimated for each line by three different
methods are shown in the following table.  Method 3 is the technique
that was hoped to be useful.<p>

Table: Comparison of growth rates as measured by different methods:<p>

These data show that delaying the measurement of plant fresh weight
until flowering and calculating the plant growth rate on this basis
underestimates the growth rate during the exponential phase of the
later flowering races.  Estimates calculated the same way but based on
log dry weights showed a similar tendency.  These races may have
genetically passed their period of exponential growth by flowering, or
the decreased growth rate over the latter part of their vegetative
stage may have been environmentally induced due to poor lighting of
the rosette and a decreased root medium. &#160;The agar had dried to
approximately one half its volume after 20 days pulling the still
green parts of these later flowering races down into the wells in
which the tubes sat.  An analysis of the relative proportions of tops
to roots and of root growth did not help to explain this
underestimation of the exponential growth rate.<p>

Whatever the cause, the conclusion must be drawn that under the
environmental conditions described, taking the log fresh weight of a
plant at flowering as an index of its growth rate while in the
exponential phase is not valid.  It therefore is not feasible to
select simultaneously on the one plant for both growth rate and
flowering time.<p>
