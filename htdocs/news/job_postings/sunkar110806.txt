A postdoctoral position is available for an individual interested in  a project focused on 
molecular aspects of plant abiotic stress  responses with emphasis on the role of microRNAs 
and small- interfering RNAs [Sunkar and Zhu, Plant Cell,16, 2001-2019, 2004;  Borsani, Zhu, 
Versules, Sunkar and Zhu, Cell, 123, 1279-1291, 2005;   Sunkar et al., Plant Cell 17, 
1397-1411, 2005; Sunkar et al., Plant  Cell 18, 2051-2065, 2006]. The successful candidate 
will develop a  vigorous project to elucidate the role of small RNAs in stress  regulatory 
networks. Applicants with strong experience in molecular  biology and plant stress biology 
and a record of publications are  especially encouraged to apply. This position is available,  
initially, for 2 years with an evaluation after first year for  continuation.

To apply, send your CV and a list of contact details of three  professional references to 
Dr. Ramanjulu Sunkar, Department of  Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 
246 Noble Research Center,  Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK 74078-3035. 
Email:  rsunkar@biochem.okstate.edu. Review of applications will begin  December 1, 2006.
