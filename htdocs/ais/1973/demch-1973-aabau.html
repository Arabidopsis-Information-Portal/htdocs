According to our earlier reports (DEMCHENKO et al., 1972), we hoped to
clarify the nature of chimerae in M1 by tissue culture experiments.
The transition of the changed somatic cells through the
non-differentiating callus growth and subsequent redifferentiation
into plantlets was chosen as appraoch to analyse the type of
alteration which has taken place in the sectors. For the same purpose
DULIEU (1971) redifferentiated chimerae of tobacco plants from
chlorophyll deficient sectors by the use of tissue culture.<p>

The results of our first experiments are as follows.  We examined
chlorophyll chimerae in M1 arising in the race En-1 of Arabidopsis
thaliana HEYNH. after treatment with N-nitrosomethyl urea.
Chlorophyll-deficient sectors of leave tissue were isolated
aseptically and pieces of 2-5 mm2 were transferred onto culture media
for the sake of induction of callus growth. Similar explants taken
from normal green leaves of untreated plants were used as control. The
control and the tested explants responded likewise to modifications in
the composition of the nutritional media, which definitively affected
the explants' further development. We used agar media MS (MURASHIGE,
SKOOG, 1962) supplemented with 3% sucrose, kietin and NAA (1 mg/l) and
vitamins after Staba.<p>

Callus develops from the explants in 8-14 days.  A combination of NAA
and kinetin in medium MS induced callus formation more efficiently
than a combination of IAA and kinetin in medium G.  Unlike medium G,
medium AS caused abundant rhizogenesis in the explants. This
observtion holds true for both normal and dfectie tissus though in the
latter growth and differentiation were inferior compared to the
normal.  On the control medium G after a month time stem buds
appeared; after 2 1/2 months the numbe rof tube sdisplaying
refifferentiation amounted to 83% of the total.  On medium MS NAA stem
buds differentiation was inhibited.  In case of chlorophyll deficiency
stem bud regeneration was reduced, and on GAMBORG's medium it reached
only 25%.<p>

The regenerated plants arising both from the defective or control
explants differed in morphogenesis from the normal plants grown in
test-tubes from seed. They were smaller, poorly foliated, often
without rosette leaves, and they had only flowers.  While plants
redifferentiated from normal tissue hardly differed from the plants
grown from seeds in the state of development including organogenesis
and sporogenesis, the plants redifferentiated from the chlorophyll
deficients sectors displayed disturbances in both micro-and
macrosporogenesis (Table 1).  In the control, about 80% of the
regenerants yielded normal seeds; no seeds were obtained from the
plants redifferentiated from the chlorophyll deficient tissue,
virespective of the albina, chlorina, viridis or xantha colour of the
explants.<p>

Most interesting is the finding that regenerants from some explants
retained their original colour.  Namely, among 4 regenerants grown
from callus derived from viridis explants three had uniformly viridis
colour and one was normal green. Segregation into the original
defective colour and normal "wild" green was noted in all viridis and
chlorina cases. Albino explants normally gave rise to
chlorophyll-deficient regenerants, only once green plants were also
obtained.  No other colour nor variegated phenotype were ever
observed. That chlorophyll-deficient tissue growing on culture media
rich in kinetin showed no repair of colour may be treated as evidence
for the genetic rather than physiological nature of the variegation.
The emergence of green regenerants on "defective" callus may be due to
several reasons (admixture of green cells in the original explants,
reversion).  Our further exploration will be aimed at understanding
the reasons for segregation of the colour in the regenerants and the
identification of the cell genotype in chimeric M1 plants.<p>

Sterility of the tested regenerants may not be an intractable
obstacle. The possibility should not be ruled out that subjected to
the proper conditions regenerants may pass through sporogenesis.
Since there was 20% sterility among the regenerants in the control, we
believe that besides genetics, also the suboptimal cultural condition
are responsible for the infertility.<p>

A similar tissue culture technique can be applied in the future for
the analysis of anthers and haploid tissues.<p>
