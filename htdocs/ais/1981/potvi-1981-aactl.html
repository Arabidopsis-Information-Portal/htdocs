INTRODUCTION<p>

This research is a part of a continuing effort directed towards a
better understanding of adaptive mechanisms by which higher plants
regulate rates of essential metabolic processes as a function of
climate (Simon, 1979a, b, c, d; Brouillet and Simon, 1980; Davidson
and Simon, 1981 a, b). We are surveying systematically widely
distributed plants associated with particular environments and
differing in growth forms and life cycles. The objective of this
particular study was to determine if there was effectively any
ecotypic differentiation related to temperature conditions in the
natural environment of two genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.)
Heynh and to ascertain eventual effects due to acclimation. As a first
step, we have studied morphological modifications and growth-rate
patterns of the two genotypes acclimated to four different
thermoperiods. Our main effort is directed towards a comprehensive
analysis of adaptive and acclimatory mechanisms involved in the
thermal regulation of catalysis controlling metabolic fluxes in higher
plants. For this purpose, we have selected two enzyme systems,
NAD-Malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and Glutamic oxaloacetate transaminase
(GOT) and analysed their kinetic and thermal properties as a function
of the original thermal environment of the two genotypes and the
experimentally induced acclimatory conditions. NAD-Malate
dehydrogenase (MDH, EC.1.1.1.37) is a pivotal enzyme in carbon
metabolism. It is involved in the citric and glyoxylate pathways (Ting
et al., 1975; Banaszak and Bradshaw, 1975). Molecular forms of the
enzyme are found in the cytosol and in organelles such as
mitochondria, glyoxysomes and peroxisomes. The enzyme has a role in
ionic, osmotic and redox regulation through the production of malate
from oxaloacetic acid and the regeneration of NADH. The cytosol forms
had a role in non-autotrophic CO 2 fixation while the peroxisome form
functions in photorespiration. Glutamic oxaloacetate transaminase
(GOT, EC. 2.6.1.1) is a crucial enzyme linking sugar and aminoacid
metabolic pathways. In addition, GOT is associated with MDH to insure
the transfer of electrons through the itochondrial membrane as both
mitochondrial and cytosol forms of the enzyme are involved (Lenhinger,
1973). The pivotal and multiple roles of MDH and GOT in the regulation
of carbon metabolism make these enzymes likely targets for adaptive
genetic shifts in response to thermal selective pressures imposed by a
plant's environment.<p>

Arabidopsis thaliana has a number of advantages for an analysis of
thermal adaptation and acclimation. Its distribution is cosmopolitan;
the geographic distribution is extensive covering an area encompassing
a 48*degree* latitudinal gradient across the equator (Redei, 1970).
The plants are short lived annuals and predominantly self-pollinated.
The species has been the subject of many ecological, physiological and
genetic studies. Finally, the species is easily grown from seeds under
controlled conditions and its life cycle may be shortened considerably
under appropriate simulated environmental conditions (Redei, 1975).<p>

MATERIAL AND METHODS<p>

Seeds of the two genotypes, Martuba-2 (MAR) and Wilna-2 (WIL) were
obtained from Dr. A.R. Kranz, Arabidopsis Information Service,
Frankfurt/Main Germany. Wilna-2 was originally collected near Wilna,
USSR (Lat. 54*degrees*, 41'N) and Martuba-2 originated from the
mediterranean coastal ranges of Lybia (Lat. 32*degrees*, 35'N). These
sites are associated with climates of contrasting temperature
conditions during the growth period of the species as indicated in
Table 1.<p>

Table 1: Monthly average minima and maxima temperatures recorded at
the localities of the two genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana. Data are
based on Van Chi Bonnardel (1973) and Walter and Lieth (1964).<p>

Seeds were germinated in a 3:1 sand-potting mixture and grown for 7
days at a 15*degree*/25*degree* C (night/day) thermoperiod, a
photoperiod of 16 hours (10,300 lux) and a constant relative humidity
of 80%. Seedlings of each genotype were then transferred to controlled
growth chambers (Conviron, model no. 20D0018) set at
5*degree/10*degree*C, 7*degree/15*degreeC, 15*degree/25*degreeC and
25*degree/28*degreeC to simulate the range of temperature conditions
experienced by the plants in their original environments.
Morphological parameters were measured 9 weeks following these
transfers. To determine growth rate patterns, similar measurements
were made on plants of the two genotypes, acclimated at
15*degrees*/25*degrees*C, 3, 4.5 and 6 weeks following their transfer
to that particular thermoperiod.<p>

Kinetic analyses for MDH were made on extracts from leaves of plants
aged between 3 and 6 weeks, depending on the thermoperiod, and
prepared according to Simon (1979a) and Davidson and Simon (1981)
using a spectrophotometric assay described by Simon (1979a). Km,
energy of activation (Ea) and specific activity of MDH were calculated
according to Wilkinson (1961) and Simon (1979a) using as reference
Sigma purified MDH from procine heart. Substrate was oxaloacetic acid
in halved concentrations ranging from 4 mM to 0.0625 mM. For GOT,
extraction techniques and the spectrophotometric assay at 340 nm were
essentially those of Berg-Meyer (1973). Km, Ea and specific activity
of GOT were calculated as for MDH, using as reference Sigma purified
GOT from porcine heart. Substrate was *alpha*-ketoglutaric acid in
halved concentrations ranging from 3 mM to 0.0967 mM.<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

Morphology and growth rates<p>

Acclimatory changes occurred for several of the parameters analysed
for this study (Table 2). For both genotypes, the average length of
leaves was significantly reduced for plants acclimated at lower
thermoperiods. In addition, for WIL a similar trend was observed for
root and foliar dry weights. These results are comparable to those
reported for several terrestrial (Treshow, 1970; Heslop Harrison,
1964; Teeri, 1978) and aquatic plants (Wooten, 1970; Suda et al.,
1977; Jones et al., 1979; Davidson and Simon, 1981) and reflect a
reduction in metabolic activity associated with a reduction in
environmental thermal energy.<p>

plants of two genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana acclimated to four
different thermoperiods. Averages based on 8 plants per subpopulation.

Plants of the two genotypes acclimated to the same thermoperiod for 9
weeks could not be differentiated for any of the parameters measured,
exxcept for root dry weight for plants acclimated at
7*degrees*-15*degrees*C (Table 2). These results were surprising
considering the contrasting temperature conditions at the original
sites of collection of the two genotypes. A priori, one would expect
that selective pressures imposed by the climatic conditions would have
determined differential adaptive growth and morphological
modifications for the genotypes (Heslop-Harrison, 1964). These
analyses were made on fully developed plants which, according to the
thermoperiod imposed upon them, had, in some cases, already flowered.<p>

In order to investigate the possibility that genotype differentiation
may occur earlier during plant development, plants were analysed, in a
new series of experiments, after 3, 4.5 and 6 weeks of growth at
15*degrees*-25*degrees*C. Results indicate that, even if the
morphological characteristics of the two genotypes are very similar at
an advanced stage of development, the growth rates are different
(Table 3).<p>

The growth rate of WIL was slower than that of MAR when considering
any of the parameters analysed. This difference in growth between the
two genotypes is particularly noticeable when comparing the length and
the dry weights of leaves of the two genotypes (Table 3). Although
this comparative trend was still observed for 6 week-old plants,
differences were not significant. This was due, in part, to the high
variability, expressed as higher standard error values, for
measurements made on WIL plants.<p>

Flowering was greatly affected by acclimation and differences in the
response were observed among the two genotypes, particularly at low
and high temperatures of acclimation (Table 4).<p>

Table 4: Period of time (days) following germination required for 50%
of the plants to flower and range (in days) of the flowering period
for two genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana acclimated to four different
thermoperiods.<p>

No plants flowered at 5*degrees-10*degrees*C even after 5 months of
growth. At 7*degrees*-15*degrees*C, plants of MAR flowered earlier and
over a shorter period than those of WIL. At 15*degrees*-25*degrees*C,
flowering was synchronous for both genotypes although WIL plants
initated flowering over a longer period of time. At
25*degrees*-28-*degrees*C, WIL failed to flower almost completely
(less than 2% of 500 seedlings reached the flowering stage) while all
MAR plants flowered on the 30th day following germination (Table 4).<p>

Differences in growth rate and flowering pattern between the two
genotypes appear to be adaptive and related to climate at the original
site of collection. The WIL genotype originated from a cool
temperature climate having a relatively long Spring season (Table 1).
During the normal growth period, plants of this genotype are
confronted with initially cool temperatures and a gradual moderate
warming by the end of the growth period. Therefore, growth rates are
adjusted to modulate the longer favourable period of time available
for growth in this environment. On the contrary, the MAR genotype is
associated to harsher climatic conditions; the Spring period is
reduced and diurnal temperatures increase rapidly and dramatically
during the short period (Table 1). The developmental cycle and
reproductive strategy of MAR plants need to be accelerated to modulate
the short favourable climatic period. Our flowering data support
previous studies which indicate that the flowering period is the most
variable character differentiating races of Arabidopsis thaliana
(Redei, 1970) under the influence of temperature and photoperiod
(Jones, 1971).<p>

Kinetic studies of MDH and GOT<p>

Short term acclimation<p>

In stationary ectotherms, like Arabidopsis thaliana, metabolic rates
have to be adjusted quickly via enzymatic rate compensation to
modulate sudden and unpredictable temperature changes in the plant's
environment. Short term acclimation for immediate compensation is
effected through nearly instantaneous modifications of
substrate-binding affinity of enzymes (modulation strategy). This
affinity is better expressed by the reciprocal of the Michaelis-Menten
constant, or apparent Km. Lower Km values indicate increased
substrate-binding affinity of the enzym (Somero, 1978). We have
calculated apparent Km values, at three different assay temperatures,
for MDH and GOT for each of the two genotypes acclimated to different
thermoperiods (Table 5).<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol18/vol18-pg108-tab5.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

Table 5: Apparent Km of malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and glutamic
oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) at three assay temperatures for two
genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana acclimated to four thermoperiods.
Values are X10E-2 mM of oxaloacetic acid for Km of MDH and, X10E-2 mM
of *alpha*-ketoglutaric acid for Km of GOT.<p>

For MDH, apparent Km increases as a positive function of temperature
for all the subpopulations analysed. The general pattern of apparent
Km-temperature responses is similar to that documented for several
ectothermic animals (Hochachka and Somero, 1973; Somero, 1978) and
plants (Simon, 1979c; Davidson and Simon, 1981 and described as
positive thermal modulation (Somero, 1975, 1978). The importance of
positive thermal modulation as an efficient rate-compensating
mechanism of metabolic processes has been stressed by Hochachka and
Somero (1973) and by Somero (1978). Increased substrate binding
affinity of the enzyme at low temperatures will compensate for a
reduction in environmental kinetic energy (Hazel and Prosser, 1974).<p>

For GOT, no such compensatory pattern is observed (Table 5). Km values
remain relatively constant at the three assay temperatures for any of
the acclimated subpopulations of Arabidopsis. This lack of response
may be realated to the function of the enzyme and to the complexity of
its catalytic involvement (Lehninger, 1973). GOT is implicated in a
transamination where the never freed amine group is first transferred
to a prostetic group (pyridoxal phosphate) and then to the substrate.
GOT has all the characteristics of a Eury-tolerant enzyme (Somero and
Low, 1977), since its catalyses a biphasic reaction in which each
phase develops similar but opposed enthalpies (*delta*H) . In this case, we
would expect that the overall kinetic reaction would be independent of
temperature.<p>

Middle term acclimation<p>

There are two acclimatory "strategies" for enzymes of ectotherms that
do not result in immediate metabolic adjustment. The first involves
the modification of enzyme concentration (quantitative strategy) and
the second, changes of the energy of activation of an enzyme, Ea
(qualitative strategy). Previous studies have shown that these
strategies are working for many enzymes in animals and plants (Hazel,
and Prossr, 1974; Hochachka and Somero, 1973; Somero, 1978; Simon,
1979b, d; Davidson and Simon, 1981) although not always in the
direction expected.<p>

For MDH and GOT, our study do not disclose a clear pattern of
modifications for energy of activation as related to acclimation.
Results of this analysis are not presented in this paper.<p>

Concentrations of both MDH and GOT increase at lower acclimatory
temperatures (Table 6). Our results are similar to those reported for
several enzyme systems in ectothermic animals (Somero, 1978) and for
some plants (Chabot, 1979).<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol18/vol18-pg110-tab6.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

thaliana acclimated to four thermoperiods. Values are micro g of
enzyme/gm of leaf fresh weight. Assays were made at 20*degrees*C.
Statistics are P values for student t-tests analyses of pair
comparison.<p>

However, for MDH, previous studies in this laboratory have shown a
reduction in enzyme activity at lower acclimatory temperatures (Simon,
1979b; Davidson and Simon, 1981; Robert, 1981). However, a similar
pattern as that reported in this study has been found recently in this
laboratory for GOT in wheat, rye and Triticale (Peloquin, Charest and
Simon, unpublished data).<p>

The quantitative strategy, based on the modulation of enzyme
concentration as a function of temperature is considered both a
metabolically expensive and relatively inefficient strategy if the
organism is confronted to large temperature variations during its life
cycle (Somero, 1978). However, the adaptive Spring life cycle strategy
of Arabidopsis thaliana appears to be directed towards the avoidance
of temperature extremes so that genotypes are confronted with rather
similar narrow temperature ranges during their short annual life
cycles (Radcliffe, 1961; Redei, 1970, 1975). Modifications in growth
rates and flowering period between the Martuba and Wilna genotypes, as
described in this paper, illustrate well this phenomenon. In this
case, the quantitative strategy may be favoured since it may become
relatively more expensive to maintain a whole arsenal of qualitatively
differentiated isozymes to cover such a narrow range of temperature
variation.<p>

Adaptive trends<p>

For MDH, no clear adaptive trends are noticeable when comparing the
kinetic data for WIL and MAR genotypes (Tables 5 and 6). Since for
this enzyme, thermal adjustment is effected through the more efficient
modulation strategy (via Km), no additional adaptive modifications
would be required to enhance catalytic activity of this enzyme over
the range of temperatures expected at each genotype's original site.<p>

Adaptive modifications in the kinetic properties of GOT are shown for
the two genotypes when plants acclimated to the lowest and higher
thermoperiods are compared (Tables 5 and 6). For plants acclimated at
5*degree*-10*degree*C there is significantly higher activity and
relatively lower apparent Km values for WIL than for MAR and this
trend is reversed for plants acclimated at 25*degrees-28*degrees*C.
Genetic differences are, therefore, expressed only at extreme
thermoperiods.<p>

For WIL, the enzyme would be more efficient at lower temperatures
which are more likely to occur during the early period of the life
cycle of this genotype in its original environment. It is at this
period that plants would require more efficient metabolic rates to
counter slow vegatative growth imposed by the low energy input. The
opposite situation prevails in the original environment of MAR and the
enhanced GOT kinetic properties for this genotype at higher
temperatures may reflect the need to increase growth rates during the
critical final development and flowering stages. Selective pressures
imposed by the inceasingly warmer climate in later Spring may have
modified the MAR genotype to adopt a highly efficient regulatory
mechanism for catalytic efficiency to cover the higher temperature
range of its original environment.<p>

SUMMARY<p>

Two genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana, Wilna-2 and Martuba-2 were
studied to detect differences in morphology, development, and
flowering patterns, and to analyse kinetic modification of two enzyme
systems in response to variations of temperature. The genotypes,
originally collected in two sites of contrasting thermal environments,
were grown under controlled conditions at four different thermoperiods
5*degrees/10*degrees*C, 7*degrees*/15*degrees*C,
15*degres*/25*degrees*C and 25*degrees*/28*degrees*C (night/day).
Acclimatory changes occurred for several of the morphological and
development parameters analysed and adaptive differences for these
parameters were found between the two genotypes which were related to
the thermal environment at the original site of collections. Specific
activity of malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and glutamic oxaloacetate
transaminase (GOT) increased at low temperatures of acclimation.
Apparent Km increased as a positive function of temperature for MDH of
the two genotypes. Adaptive shifts in the modulation of the Km of MDH
and specific activity of GOT may be related to the original thermal
environment of the genotypes. GOT activity was significantly higher
for Wilna at lower acclimatory temperatures while the opposite
situation prevailed for Martuba. Apparent Km for GOT did not vary with
assay temperature.<p>
