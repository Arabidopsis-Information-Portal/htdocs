INTRODUCTION<p>

Ionizing radiation effects are commonly based on total dose and not on
microdosimetric evaluation of single ion particles. Therefore a more
detailed evaluation of single hit effects could not be achieved
(Bucker, 1974). With broadened availability of heavy ions and nuclear
track detectors methods of microdosimetric measurements have been
elaborated by which the distances of particle tracks from the
biological objects are measured under an improved microscope equipped
for micropositioning. In this way dose calculation was based more
directly to the energy deposition in microspace of the particle track
(Schafer et al., 1977). In parallel an improvement of the particle hit
inside uni- or multicellular organisms could be achieved (Scheidemann
et al., 1978). In the scope of studies on the biological effectiveness
of heavy ions in powerful accelerator as well as in space flight
experiments a new approach has been made for improving the biophysical
basis of dose parameters (Barckhausen et al., 1981).<p>

Seeing that a large number of seeds (Arabidopsis thaliana) and spores
(Sordaria fimicola) have to be examined (Schott et al, 1983) it was
decided to install a computerized system for microdosimetric
measurements of HZE particles with seeds and spores.<p>

OPERATIONS<p>

Presently, the installed system consists of the microcomputer SIRIUS I
with 256kByte RAM with two printers and Leitz Orthoplan microscope
with a desk which is micropositioned by step-motors through an
interface unit. The step-motors can be controlled by the computer
which is installed presently (Figure 1).<p>

At the time being the software for controlling the microscope and
executing measurements of seeds or spores and tracks with analysis of
the obtained data are being developed.<p>

The program is divided into several parts by overlay procedures
because of the limited space available. At the beginning of a
measurement you can call the Main Menu, which allows to select from
some subprograms that one you need for your purpose (Figure 2). The
subprograms also have a menu-structure with different number of
possibilities to select. The subprogram for measurements of seeds or
spores is divided into 6 subprograms (Figure 3). The most important
parts of this program are, the subprogram for getting the data of the
objects measured, e.g., localization of the object on the detector,
and the subprogam for calculation of this form with data storage on
disk, and afterwards plotting the object. The plotted form of the
object is determined by an ellipse but instead of two different
semiaxis it is necessary to use four different semiaxis. In case of
seed the position of the radicle meristem is specified by only one
measurement. The form of the meristem is calculated out of the data of
the seed. The suggested form of meristem is the half of an ellipse.
With a spore, specific compartments of a cell (nucleus, vacuole) may
be measured.<p>

The subprogram for measurement of tracks is divided into four
subprograms (Figure 4). Within this program it is possible to
determine a track by measuring two points of it and to store these
data on a minidisk.<p>

The subprogram for calculating the impact parameter (Figure 5) needs
the data of the two programs discussed before. It calculates the
distance between each track measured and a spore cell compartment or
the radicle meristem of a seed. The object and the tracks within a
certain impact parameter may be plotted on the screen and on the
needle printer with some mo-information (Figure 6).<p>

The whole program is written in BASIC, but to accelerate the graphics
and the handling of the large number of data we do use a BASIC
compiler. In order to accelerate the graphics and the calculation of
the impact parameter it is planned to rewrite the parts of the program
to Fortran or even to Assembler. It is expected for the near future
that the whole system will be available.<p>

The sequence of operations will be divided into three parts: a) At the
beginning the seeds or spores which are fixed on a HZE particle
detector are completely measured out, and the individual data are
stored on a minidisk. The measured object can be plotted on the screen
of the microcomputer and the plot may be printed by the needle printer
with additional information of position and size of the object (Figure
6).  b) Following these measurements the tracks of the HZE particles
can be measured out and the data stored on a minidisk.  c) After step
b) it will be possible to calculate the impact parameter of the HZE
particle and the objects measured. The hit or nearly hit objects and
the corresponding tracks may be plotted on the screen; the plot is
then printed by the needle printer with additional information of the
object and the HZE particle.<p>

After this procedure the most interesting objects may be selected,
removed from the detector and the biological effects can be finally
examined by seeding on relevant culture media.<p>

CONCLUSION<p>

The system described allows rationalizing of the time-consuming
microdosimetric operations and, furthermore, the complete storage and
data processing permits effective statistical analysis of the
measurements performed.<p>
