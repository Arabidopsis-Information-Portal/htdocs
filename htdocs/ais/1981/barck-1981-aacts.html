During the last decade effects of cosmic radiation especially HZE
particles (heavy ions) on dry seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.)
Heynh. flying in space with Apollo 16 and 17, Cosmos-613, and
Apollo-Soyuz have been investigated (BUEKER, 1974, 1978; BUEKER et
al., 1976; KRANZ et al., 1978, 1979; BENEVOLENSKY et al., 1975). By
such studies some modified biological processes of hit seeds, e.g.
germination, growth and development of the seedling have been
observed.  However, clear evidences for gene mutations failed, although
multicalus, chlorophyll defective plants were found in M1. In this
respect there were more or less significant differences between HZE
hit plants and the earth control.<p>

Frome numerous radiation genetic experiments with Arabidopsis seeds
(REDEI, 1969; IVANOV, 1974) we know that the frequency of induced
mutations depends on the dose rates of radiation as well as the number
of genetic effective cells (GECN) in the multicellular meristem of the
shoot apex. This GECN may vary between two and more cells with
increasing growth of the developing seedling (Figure 1). Thus, the
assumption that HZE particle induced damage might become manifest if a
significant number of nonreplacable cells (such as GECN) are affected.<p>

Consequently, several improvements were elaborated concerning the
physical and geometric determination of particle track location
outside and inside the seed, by the so-called Biostack- or
Biobloc-conception (Benevolensky et al., 1975; Bocker et al., 1976).
If a particle penetrated a given detector (cellulose nitrate foils,
monolayer AgCl-crystal) to which the seeds were fixed, it could be
determinated from the coordinates of the track points and of the main
seed axis whether the particle had crossed the cotyledons or the
radicle of the seedling. Higher optical resolution of external and
internal seed structure could neither be outlined by direct nor
indirect light under the microscope of high optical resolution (Figure
2).<p>

In November 1980 most of the criteria were fulfilled in favor of
microlesions produced by single HZE particles in studying the mouse
cornea under the scanning electron microscope (Tobias et al., 1980).
At the same time we started a program for solving our problems of
track location inside the seed by scanning electron microscopy.<p>

It was our intention to improve the exact location of the lesion
induced by the particle inside the seed, and last not least to
determine the probably hit GECN by this technique. In the following a
first, preliminary report on our studies is presented.<p>

Material and Methods<p>

As part of a ground control experiment of the Spacelab Experiment
"Advanced Biostack" samples of 150 to 200 seeds of A. thaliana, race
Enkheim (En-2) were exposed to argon of 728 MeV/amu and to iron of 602
MeV/amu. In order to determine the number of hits the seeds were fixed
to particle track detectors. In the iron experiment CN foils were used
whereas in the argon experiment the seeds were closely fixed by
luviskol on an AgCl-detector (Schopper and Schott, 1977). During the
exposure to 2 x 10E-4 particles/cm 2 the tracks were stabilized by
yellow light, thereafter decorated at the Institute of Nuclear Physics
of the University of Frankfurt (Schott, 1974). A mean number of hits x
= 17.4 +/- 5.7 per seed was calculated from the evaluation of the
track detectors using the LEITZ Orthoplan microscope.<p>

Preparation of seeds for scanning electron microscopy was as follows:
Loosing the luviskol fixative with water (aqua dest.) and transforming
the seeds from the AgCl monolayer crystal, fixing the seeds with
UHU-hard on a metal block, drying, steaming and coating with gold in
vacuum for 4 min., placing into the scanning electron microscope
(Hitachi S-500) and observation, rsp. photographing at 25 to 30 kV.<p>

in A. thaliana<p>

Preparation for light microscopy of sections through the seedling
(Figure 1) was as follows: Three to four days after sowing germinating
seedlings frozen in ethylalcohol (5%) were cutted with LEITZ freezing
microtome 1310, prepared in luviskol (10%) on slides, observed and
photographed under LEITZ Orthoplan microscope plus Varioorthomat
camera.<p>

RESULTS AND CONCLUSION<p>

Firstly, seeds of an experiment with argon were investigated. The most
important finding was an occasionally single hole in the outer cell
wall of the seed coat. The diameter of the hole (2 to 3 micro m) was
in the range of the supposed damage area. Optimum contrast was only
observed for holes located at the thicker part of cell wall (Figure
3c), where the normal wall structure is quite homogeneous. Number of
such holes per seed did not exceed the mean number of estimated HZE
particle tracks.<p>

In the middle of the cell the wall is more folded and elevated forming
a hill (Figure 3b); evidently, this structural pattern is related to
mucillage production upon imbibition (Koornneef, 1981). Therefore this
area is disadvantageous for finding holes. Moreover, soaking of seeds
produces a massive destruction of the seed surface. Thus, artefacts
may be obtained of similar structure than the holes mentioned above.
The series of photos in figure 3a demonstrates such presumed "non-HZE
induced" holes, though this control seed was also treated at the
accelerator. Holes of such kind were also obtained occasionally with
seedlings of an iron experiment. Their structure was clearly disrupted
and their diameter ranges from 1 to 10 micro m; moreover, the holes
were clustered around restricted parts of the seed surface. We suppose
that such artefacts might be caused by the fixative luviskol.<p>

Evidently, the lesions produced physiological defects (modifications)
in HZE-hit seeds. In the argon experiment seed germination of M 1 was
reduced (10 to 20%); comparable data for the iron experiment were 20
to 40%. Moreover, frequency of sublethal seedlings and those with
localized chlorophyll defects, necrotic as well as tuberous growth
increased significantly.<p>

The results so far obtained clearly show that one year of experimental
experience with microlesions is still at premium. Now, it is feasible
to plan further improved experiments to investigate lesions produced
by HZE particles under the scanning electron microscope. For finding
complete evidence of microlesions the criteria defined by TOBIAS et
al. (1980) have to be modified and adapted to the seed of Arabidopsis
as follows:<p>

1. A single HZE particle should produce exactly one structural lesion.<p>

2. The lesion may appear in adjacent cells along the track of the
single heavy particle.<p>

3. Position and geometric parameters of the microlesion should fit the
corresponding parameters of the particle identified by the track
detector medium.<p>

4. The fine structure of the hole and the track channel set by the
HZE-hit should fit the expected residual and lateral range of physical
and chemical intractions leading to nonreversible damage.<p>

5. The lesions may produce structural and functional defects elated to
the affected tissue and organ of the seedling which may either repair
or develop into larger defects in M 1 generation (modification).<p>

6. In sequence of the damage radiochemical and biological processes
may induce genetic aberrations (mutations) as far as cells of the
germline (shoot apex) were physically penetrated by the HZE particle.
Thus, clear evidences should be obtained by analysing the following
generation (M 2).<p>

SUMMARY<p>

Although we did not find conclusive evidence for microlesions that
would satisfy all 6 criteria stated above, with scanning electron
microscopy, however, some of the criteria were fulfilled. A certain
type of the holes observed for the first time at the surface cell
walls of the seed coat of a higher plant is a good candidate for
supposed microlesions induced by HZE particles. Since the size and
extent of the lesions observed are still in doubt, improved
experiments are prepared presently.<p>
