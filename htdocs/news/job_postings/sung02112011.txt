Postdoctoral Fellow Position
Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California, Berkeley

A postdoctoral fellow position is available in the Department of Plant 
and Microbial biology, University of California, Berkeley, to study 
epigenetic regulation of gene expression, specifically on genes 
regulated by the Polycomb Group proteins. Applicants should have a PhD 
in Genetics, Biochemistry or Molecular Biology with excellent 
communication skills. Experience in Arabidopsis growth and 
development, genomics and biochemical skills in immunoprecipitation, 
and chromatin biology are desirable. Interested candidates should send 
CV, 2 letters of recommendation with a brief description of long term 
research interest and career goal to sungr@berkeley.edu
