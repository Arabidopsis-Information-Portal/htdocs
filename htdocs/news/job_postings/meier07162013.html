POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH POSITION
<p>An NSF-funded postdoctoral research position is available in the
    Department of Molecular Genetics, The Ohio State University. We have
    recently discovered in Arabidopsis the first plant nuclear envelope bridging
    complex, which connects the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm by direct interactions
    in the nuclear envelope lumen. In animals and fungi, these complexes are
    involved in nuclear positioning and anchoring and their loss leads to
    developmental and neural defects, involving heritable human diseases. The
    plant complexes are evolutionary only distantly related to their animal
    counterparts, and we have begun a broad program of their structural and
    functional investigation, involving roles in pollen development,
    plant-microbe interactions, and other nuclear-movement related processes in
    plant. This work combines computational, cellular, molecular, and genetic
    investigations.</p>
<p>The successful postdoctoral candidate has a Ph.D. in plant molecular
    genetics or biochemistry, preferably with experience in Arabidopsis,
    first-author publications in widely respected scientific journals, and is
    proficient in written and spoken English. Experience in state-of-the-art
    live imaging or proteomic techniques is a plus.</p>
