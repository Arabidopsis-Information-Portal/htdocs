SUMMARY<p>

The common formula for the probability calculus for possibilities of
distribution of several mutations in the apices with the given number
of initials was elaborated. Experimentally the excess of multimutated
nucclei in comparison to the expected number was found. A possible
explanation is based on the different mitotic activity of the cells in
the time of mutagenic treatment. Experimental data indicate the
existence of the diplontic drift influence between initial and
temporal specific repair processes after the mutagenic treatment.<p>

INTRODUCTION<p>

Treating the seeds at mutation induction with regard to the mutation
realization in the next generation we are interested in genetically
effective initials in the embryo shoot apex in those seeds. Many
authors dealt with manifestation of the apex organization in
Arabidopsis, i.e. M 1 chimerism. The number and size of mutated
sectors either by M 2 segregation analysis or directly by localization
of mutations inside inflorescences were studied (Muller, 1965;
Shevchenko et al., 1975; Relichova; 1977; Mednic and Usmanov, 1982).
So it was stated in Arabidopsis that the number of genetically
effective initials (GECN) which gave rise to sporogenic tissue of
mature plant was small, most probably from 2 to 4 (Langridge, 1958;
Muller, 1964; Ivanov, 1971; Relichova, 1977; Grinikh et al., 1979;
Bork et al., 1987).<p>

Under certain conditions of mutgenic treatment when higher mutation
frequencies were reached, results showed a possibility of rise of
multimutations since some M 1 offspring segregate in M 2 more than one
mutation in Arabidopsis (Muller, 1965; Balkema, 1971). It was proved
(Relichova, 1977) that the occurrence of more mutations in the embryo
apex include both principally different ways of distribution of these
mutations, i.e., either each of them in another initial cell or
several mutations in the single cell nucleus, i.e., the real
multimutation. Also a system of classification of possible ways of
distribution was elaborated for several mutations in the shoot apex
(Relichova and Cetl, 1972) where e.g. the distribution of two
mutations in the apex with two initial cells can be {1/1} or {2/0},
while the second alternative represents the real double mutation.<p>

This paper adds to the theoretical model of mutation distribution
(Relichova, 1981) a common formula for the probability calculus of
distribution possibilities of several mutations and verifies it
experimentally in Arabidopsis.<p>

MATERIAL AND METHODS<p>

Dry Arabidopsis seeds (race S96) were treated with different
concentrations of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU .04, .08, .12 mM during
24 hours at 25*degrees*C and then 3 hours washed in water). Progeny of
five succeeded pods per individual M 1 plant were grown in M 2. In M 2
the occurrence of chlorophyll and morphological mutations were
observed and in case of occurrence of more than one mutation in the M
2 family the stability of mutants was examined in M 3.<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

A common formula was established for probability calculus of
possibilities of the distribution of several mutations (m) in apices
with the given number of initial cells (k) which presumes an
independent distribution both from the mutation and the initial cells
inside. The probability of specific distribution of mutations in the
given apex is:<p>

From the experimental results of the topographic study of the
occurrence of several mutations in the individual M 1 pod progenies it
was possible to estimate GECN and the location of mutations in those
cells (Table 1).<p>

In any case it is necessary to bear in mind that the distribution of
mutations in the initial cells are evaluated according to their
derivatives, i.e., as mutations realized in the M 1 inflorescences. It
is well known that the apex structure goes through numerous changes
during the development from the seed embryo to the mature plant.
Regardless of the mutation induction, those changes concern GECN,
while at least two initials in the dormant seed (Grinikh et al., 1979)
about five GECN reach to the rosette stadium (Shevchenko and Grinikh,
1985). Simultaneously the same group of initial cells in the embryo
apex give rise both to the generative tissue of the main and secondary
inflorescences, and to the somatic tissue of the stem leaves
(Shevchenko et al, l1977). In the mutation induction the fate of those
mutations is important (i.e., initial cells carrying mutuation) in the
embryonic developmental process. Diverse DNA repair systems are
involved there (Veleminsky and Gichner, 1978) as well as the diplontic
drift or diplontic selection (Muller, 1963; Balkema, 1971). The
mathematical model of fixation or loss of mutations, be it selectively
neutral or under diplontic selection, elaborated by Klekowski and
Kazarinova Fukshansky (1984) emphasize the stochastic apex growth. At
validity of that model it is evident that we cannot trace back the
primary number of initials and the mutant changes induced in them
according to the occurrence of the mutated sectors. Nevertheless, we
can say that the experimentally obtained data represent their minimal
values. These facts should be considered with the evaluation of the
experimental data.<p>

For verifying the model of mutation distribution the part of Table 1
was chosen where the frequency of several mutations was highest (Table
2).<p>

A conspicuous difference between the two alternative distributions can
be seen favouring multimutated nuclei. One of the possible
explanations is offered itself supposed already by Balkema (1971): In
the time of mutagenic treatment the initital cells can have different
mitotic activity, and then be differently sensitive to the mutagenic
treatment.<p>

From the cell side the mutation induction favoured some of them. The
fate of these initials can be estimated as late as after the final
realization in the M 1 inflorescence (via M 2). The cases when only
one genetically effective initial manifested itself in the M 1 apices
(Table 1), testify to the influence of the diplontic drift or
diplontic selection. According to rather insignificant reduction of
GECN with increasing concentration we can judge, that primarily random
selection resulting in the diplontic drift is involved which takes
place in the developmental process of the apex carrying the mutation.
To this further cases bear witness in which the mutated sector
involves the substantial part of the apical meristem.<p>

At the topographic tracing of the occurrence of several mutations in
the apex one more interesting finding was registered. In many cases
proved through M 3 analysis, one mutated sector carried still one more
smaller mutated sector. In those cases repair processes could be
involved taking place in some time after the first division of the
treated initial cells.<p>
