Oostindier-Braaksma and Feenstra (1973) isolated mutants of a.
thaliana which were blocked in the uptake or reduction of nitrate by
selection of chlorate-resistant seedings in M2's. In our studies we
try to develop a method for isolation of nitrate reductaseless mutants
of A. thaliana using the technique of tissue culture. Our aim is to
investigate whether mutants can be found which differ from those that
could be isolated as intact plants.<p>

In order to establish the appropriate chlorate concentrations, callus
cultures derived from anthers of the mutant type "erecta" of the
ecotype "Landsberg" of A. thaliana (L.) Heynh. and a nitrate
reductaseless mutant (B25; Oostindier-Braaksma and Feenstra, 1974)
were used to inoculate suspension cultures (the ploidy-level was not
determined). Media, culture conditions and plating technique were
essentially as described by Negrutiu et al. (1975). From callus
cultures of wildtype a cell line (A28) was isolated showing a vigorous
growth on solid media. In suspension culture this line forms
aggregates of uniform size (about 50 cells). When A28 is plated on
solid media bright yellow colonies can be seen within a week. This
makes A28 very suitable for plating experiments.<p>

The nitrate reductaseless mutant B25 and line A28 were plated on solid
media with increasing concentrations chlorate up to 2000 ppm. Our
first results showed a growth inhibition for A28 with concentrations
above 300 ppm. No colonies are formed when concentrations above 800
ppm are used. The growth of B25 is not affected with increasing
concentrations chlorate above 300 ppm. The increase of dry-weight of
wildtype and B25 calli showed the same pattern when these calli were
incubated on solid media with increasing concentrations chlorate. The
ratios of nitrate reductase activity in extracts of calli of wildtype
and B25 grown on medium with nitrate and ammonium are comparable to
that of young wildtype and B25 plants (18.2 and 19.8 rsp.) Muller and
Grafe (1975) isolated nitrate reductase mutants of Nicotiana tabacum
by selection for haploid chlorate resistant calli using chlorate
concentrations above 500 ppm.<p>

Our results suggest that with regard to the resistance to chlorate
tissue cultures of A. thaliana show the same pattern as N. tabacum.<p>

We conclude that chlorate-resistance can be employed for the selection
of nitrate reductaseless cell cultures of Arabidopsis.<p>
