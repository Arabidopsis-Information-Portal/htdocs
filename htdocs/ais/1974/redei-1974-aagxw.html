<h2>Improvements in screening mutations</h2><p>

An impressive endeavor has been devoted to studies of mutation in
Arabidopsis.  In the majority of experiments MULLER's (1963, 1965)
embryo test has been used and the induced mutations were screened by
the examination of 1-5 siliques of the M1 plants, and the mutants were
discarded. When the mutants have to be saved for genetic studies, the
seed of the M1 plants is carried to M2.  The number of the plants
needed in M1 generation will be determined by the (a) mutation rate,
(b) level of ploidy, (c) the number of cells in the germline at the
time of the treatment and (d) by the effectiveness of the recovery of
the mutation induced. When parameters (a), (b) (c) are known (LI and
REDEI 1969), by the use of the following formula the minimal size of
the M1 population (n) can be calculated (REDEI 1974) n = (log desired
probability/log expected frequency).<p>

The size of the M2 will determine how many of the actually induced
mutations will be retrieved.  If the M1 is chimerical, the sector size
has to be also considered (REDEI 1974) and the actual testing of the
offspring of each sector may be necessary.<p>

In the simplest case the following relations apply betwen M2 size and
the probablility of the recovering at least one mutant in the progeny
of a non-chimerical heterozygote.<p>

The interpretation is simple, if the M2 (or F2) is tested with 24
offspring, 0.999 is the chance that at least one recessive mutant will
be found.  If we use only a single plant in the M2 (or F2), there is a
0.25 probability for finding the same mutant.  In other words at the
expense of working with 24 fold larger population the chances of
retrieving that mutant improves only 4 fold; similarly the use of only
8 seedlings in M2 does not involve a serious risk of missing a
particular mutation if the transmission and survival are normal.<p>

Thus we can save substantial time and space by reducing the size of
the individual M2 population. The saving may make possible to grow a
comparably larger number of M1 plants.  If we grow 1 heterozygous
plant and test its progeny with 24 offspring, the maximum number of
different mutations is 1, (and this may occur in ca.6 copies).  If we
grow 24 M1 plants and test their M2 progeny with 1 offspring each, we
have an equal chance to find 6 mutations and the probability is good
that they are all independent. Thus, if the cost per plant is the same
in M1 and M2, in the first example the cost of an independent mutation
is 25/1 (25) while in the second, the same is 48/6 (8). Thus this
simple example shows that the second procedure may cost 1/3 as much as
the first.<p>

If the M1 is chimerical, depending on the number of sectors, the most
desirable M2 size may increase proportionally.  According to the
experiences of my laboratory, after dry seed treatment, there are two
sectors in the M1 plants in the majority of cases.<p>
