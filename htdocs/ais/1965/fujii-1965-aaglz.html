Vol 01S: <h2>Effects of UV-Rays on Arabidopsis Seedlings</h2><p>

(Preliminary Report)<p>

T. FUJII<p>

Mutation studies of ultraviolet irradiation are very interesting from
the view point of fundamental genetics, since UV-rays are absorbed in
a definite and specific manner by nuclei acid, unlike X- or *gamma*
rays. Biological and genetical effects of UV-rays have been studied by
a number of investigators who used microorganisms in most cases. In
higher plants, aberrations produced by UV-rays in Tradescantia and
maize pollen were reported by SWANSON (1943), STADLER and UBER (1942),
FABERGE (1940), KIRBY-SMITH and CRAIG (1957), BAILEY and WOLFF (1964),
etc., and a comprehensive review of the results has been published by
BREWBAKER and EMERY (1962). UV-rays were also applied to barley pollen
by LUNDQVIST (1963) who found several kinds of mutants. LUNDEN and
WALLACE (1961) also obtained several chlorophyll mutants by UV
treatment of barley and oat embryos.<p>

Application of UV radiation to seeds or plant body of higher plants
presents some difficulties because of its small penetrating power.
Hence, seedlings of Arabidopsis which have a transparent slender stem
are a suitable material for such experiments. Killing and mutagenic
effects of UV-rays are here briefly reported; wild growing and
heterozygotic materials were used.<p>

Material and Method: Seeds of a wild hairy type of the race
"Landsberg" of Arabidopsis thaliana and its glabrous recessive mutant
(gl1) were kindly furnished by Dr. G. P. REDEI, University of
Missouri, U.S.A. The present author had already reported about the
convenience of mutation experiments with heterozygotic material, since
the result may be obtained from the irradiated generation (FUJII,
1964). The same method of observation was used in the present
experiment. Namely, F2 seeds obtained from the F1 of crosses between
the hairless mutant and the wild hairy strain were used because it is
somewhat difficult to obtain many F1 seeds.<p>

Seeds were sown on wet filter paper in Petri dishes. About 5 mm long
seedlings were exposed to UV-rays 3 days after sowing. Wave length of
the UV-rays was 253.7m*micro* as mostly used for biological studies;
the absorbed energy or dose rate was 90.3 ergs/mm/2 sec.  Experiments
were carried out under continuous artificial light of about 1000 lux
in an air-conditioned room at 25 +/- 2*degrees*C.<p>

Results and Considerations<p>

Killing effects of UV-rays. Killing effect of UV-rays was examined
prior to the genetic experiment, to ascertain if the severe killing
effect of these rays observed in microorganisms would be also found in
higher plants. Another aim of this experiment was the determination of
the optimum dosage for further mutation experiments.<p>

200 seeds of the wild type were used for each lot. Seedlings were
exposed for 1 - 100 min to UV-rays and were kept in a dark room
immediately after irradiation for fixation of UV effect or elimination
of photoreactivation effect. Seedlings were then removed to the
experimental room and kept in light after 24 hour dark treatment, and
the survivals were counted two weeks later. Killing effectiveness of
UV- rays was very high; about half of the treated seedlings died after
10 min treatment and almost all died out after 100 min treatment.
Moreover, retardation of growth was also marked, for instance, about
half of the seedlings had developed only cotyledons without any
further growth in the 1 min lot (Table 1). Such seedlings are expected
to die out soon.<p>

Table 1: Survival rate in irradiated seedlings<p>

At the second step of the experiment, seedlings of the same material
were irradiated with the same dosages. They were placed after
irradiation in the experimental room, in light, for examination of
photoreactivation effect. Survival rate was checked at the same time
as at the first step, namely two weeks after the UV treatment. The
survival rate was in all lots increased as compared with dark
treatment: the rate after 1 min treatment was similar to that of
controls, being 98 percent, and about 30 percent of seedlings survived
even in the highest dosage lot. By this procedure a photoreactivation
effect was recognized.<p>

When the survival rates after both treatments were represented by
curve, photoreactivation effect was more marked in higher than in
lower dosage lots as shown in Figure 1.<p>

The growth of many plants was arrested when dark treatment was
applied. It is assumed that this is due to pre-mutational damage by
dark treatment after UV-irradiation. This damage was recovered by
photoreactivation processes, and therefore the number of such
seedlings became very small and survival rate in the last experiment
was high.<p>

photoreactivation<p>

From these two experiments, we could recognize a severe killing effect
of UV-rays on the body of Arabidopsis and also, the photoractivation
phenomenon. But I do not know whether the severe killing effect
coincides or not with the induction of gene mutation, because the stem
of young seedlings is very soft and transparent and it seems that
UV-rays act on the stem rather than on the growing point.<p>

2. Induction of somatic mutations:<p>

Usually such dosage of radiation for mutation experiment is applied
which reduce the survival rate to about half or two thirds against the
unradiated control. About 1500 seedlings were used in each lot and 0.5
and 1 min exposures were applied with the same intensity as in the
killing experiment. Irradiated seedlings were kept in a dark room for
24 hours. Seedlings were transplanted to sand in pots when the dark
treatment was terminated. Survival rate after 0.5 min irradiation was
80.8 per cent, and that after 1 min irradiation was about 50 percent
which is in good accord with the results of the killing experiment.<p>

During the growth of seedlings, the segregation ratio of hairless
homozygotes was examined. In the 0.5 min lot, hairless homozygotes
segregated according to the ratio 3: 1, as expected.  Should somatic
mutation from dominant hairy to recessive hairless occur in
heterozygotes, it would have appeared in some parts of the plant body.
Two thirds of hairy plants were expected to be heterozygots. Hairless
sectors appeared in two plants in the 0.5 min lot among 581 presumably
heterozygotic plants. From the results, the mutation rate was
calculated as 0.34 per cent, as shown in Table 2.<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol01S/vol01S-pg150-tab2.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

Table 2: Segregation ratio and mutation rate in irradiated F2
populations (*Calculated as 1/2 or surviving plants)<p>

Segregation ratio of hairless homozygotes in the 1 min lot did not fit
the 3 : 1 ration. A similar radiosensitivity in both strains was
observed in X-ray and neutron irradiations by the present author
(FUJII, 1964). The small number of hairless plants in the 1 min lot
might be due to their low sensitivity between both strains. Only one
mutated plant was observed in the 1 min lot among 552 hairly plants.
The low mutation rate in this lot seems to be the result of a too
small number of surviving plants.<p>

Usually mutated sectors occupy nearly the half area of a leaf, and
whole leaf was also mutated when X-rays and neutrons were applied to
dry seeds (FUJII 1964). Leaf sectors in the present experiment were
smaller than in the former cases. For instance, two leaves had a
hairless sector among 21 leaves within the same individual and the
area of the sector occupied respectively about 1/3 and 1/4 of the
leaf. Another plant had one leaf with a mutated sector among 12
leaves, and the mutated area was also about 1/3 of the leaf. The
difference in sector size between previous and present experiments may
be caused by the different developmental stage at irradition time,
because UV-treatment was applied to young seedling stage while X-rays
and neutrons were applied to dry seeds. Another plausible reason in
relation to sector size could be the different radiation kind; action
of UV rays depends on excitation of molecules while ionization is the
main source of radiation effect in X- rays or neutrons. For instance,
the difference in chromatid aberration ratio between X- and UV-rays
was observed by KIRBY-SMITH and CRAIG (1957) and others. These
questions wait further investigation.<p>

Conclusion: Somatic mutations were induced in Arabidopsis by UV.
Relative biological effectiveness (RBE) is one of the main problems of
the radiobiologist. KONDO (1963) determined the RBE values of UV-rays
against X-rays using the data from STADLER and SPRAGUE (1963), STADLER
and UBER (1942) and KIRBY-SMITH and CRAIG (1957) to be according to
the basic equation 1 erg/mm2 = 3 x 104 rad. He calculated the RBE for
mutation in maize pollen as 3 x 10-5, and UV's RBE for chromosome
aberrations in Tradescantia to be of the order of 10-3 ~ 10-4. A
preliminary calculation of RBE for somatic mutation was attempted,
though treatment was applied at different growth stages as mentioned
before and with different water content. In relation to these
problems, BAILEY (1964) observed that the increased moisture content
of the material and its condition (dormant and growing) at the time of
exposure to UV-rays modified the response of the pollen tube
chromosomes of Tradescantia. Somatic mutation rate in my experiment
was 0.34 percent in the 0.5 min lot. Similar mutation frequency was
observed in about 15 krad of X-ray irradiation according to the
dose-versus-mutation curve in my previous experiment (FUJII, 1964).
Gamma-ray 15 krad corresponded to 0.5 ergs and 0.5 min UV treatment
represent 2700 ergs. Then UV's RBE for somatic mutation at 0.34
percent mutation frequency was calculated as follows;<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol01S/vol01S-pg151-fig2.gif">Click here for figure</a><p>

Namely about 5400 times stronger energy absorption is necessary for
producing a certain mutation rate from UV-rays against that of X-
rays. RBE of UV-rays was assessed as 1.9 x 10-4 (0.5/2700) on the
basis of the above formula. The order of values in my experiment was
similar to that of KONDO's assessment.<p>

Photoreactivation effect was observed; it is attributed to recovery of
premutational damage. Further studies about these problems and
dose-versus-mutation curves with and without dark treatment are not
under examinaiton.<p>
