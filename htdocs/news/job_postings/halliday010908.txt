POSITIONS AVAILABLE in Integrative Biology in the UK,  at the Universities 
of Edinburgh, Warwick, York and Liverpool. 
(closing date 31st January 2008) 
 
 
We are currently recruiting a high-calibre interdisciplinary research team 
to work on BBSRC funded research that will model the effects of temperature 
on plant development. This large integrative project will operate over four 
sites at the Universities of Edinburgh, Warwick, York and Liverpool, and 
will involve biologists working on molecular signalling and climate change, 
Mathematicians and Informaticians. Excellent facilities are available for 
the modelling of dynamic biological processes and using the techniques of 
computational biology, for molecular genetics, biochemistry and high 
throughput data production. 
 
Positions available 
 
1.      One Lead Experimental Postdoctoral Research Associate (Edinburgh) 
.       Expertise: plant molecular genetics, protein production, 
interdisciplinary work, experienced supervisor 
 
2.      Two Theoretical Postdoctoral Research Associates (Edinburgh, 
Warwick) 
.       Expertise: mathematical biology and/or computational systems biology 
 
 
3.      Two Experimental Postdoctoral Research Associates (York, Liverpool) 
.       Expertise: plant molecular genetics, microscopy (Y), 
interdisciplinary work 
 
4.      Four Lab-based technicians (Edinburgh, York, Liverpool) 
.       Expertise: Arabidopsis, plant genetics, molecular biology 
techniques, spreadsheets, must be highly organised 
 
5.      One Administrator (Edinburgh) 
.       Expertise: knowledge of University, grant and finance administration 
 
 
 
We would like to encourage applicants who are developing a high profile 
track record in innovative research or administration.  Good quality, 
relevant,  peer reviewed papers are essential for PDRA, and desirable for 
technician applicants.
