	The study of the effects of ionizing radiations on biological membranes has received particular attention in the actual biophysical research.  Numerous examples of permeability changes induced by ionizing radiations have been reported in the literature both for animals and plants (SRB, 1964; VAN CANEGHEM and LACHAPELLE, 1965).  Moreover, the release of a number of compounds by irradiated microorganisms (MANIL, 1959) and of dipicolinic acid by irradiated Clostridium spores (MILIC and BONOTTO, 1966) could be due partly to certain permeability modifications induced by ionizing radiations in cellular membranes in addition to eventual induced metabolic disorders. We have studied the effect of low doses of gamma radiation on the permeability of Arabidopsis seeds to EMS.<p>

	Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) HEYNH., Wil-2, presoaked for 16 hrs in distilled water were irradiated in a Gamma-Cell (3.000 c.60Co) at 22-23*degrees*C with a dose of 5.000 rad. After the irradiation the seeds were placed during different periods of time in contact with a solution of 3H-EMS, and digested 2 hrs at 60*degrees*C in a solution of hydroxide of hyamine Packard and methanol (1:1, v/v).  The total tritium radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting with a Packard Tri-Carb spectrometer.<p>

	In the table the amount of 3H-EMS taken up by control and by irradiated seeds is reported.  It appears that gamma radiation activates the uptake of 3H-EMS in presoaked seeds. We have not observed a similar phenomenon in gamma irradiated dry seeds (BONOTTO and JACOBS, l966).  The results reported here could be explained by a permeability change induced by gamma radiation in the cellular membranes of the seeds leading to a higher absorption of the 3H-EMS molecules.<p>
