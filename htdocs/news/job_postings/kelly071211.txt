Research Associate - Biostatistics/Bioinformatics 

Department of Plant Sciences, University of Cambridge, UK 

  

Modelling control of meiotic recombination frequency 

---------------------------------------------------- 

Meiotic recombination generates novel combinations of genetic variation via 
reciprocal exchange between homologous chromosomes. To better understand 
this process we are generating genome-wide recombination frequency maps in 
the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. 

  

The research associate will integrate recombination frequency maps with 
genomic, epigenomic and population genetic data. They will then develop a 
quantitative model for control of recombination frequency, which will be 
tested using experimental genetics. This research has important implications 
for population genetics and food security via crop breeding. 

  

The research associate will work jointly within Dr Ian Henderson's 
experimental research group and the Departmental Bioinformatics Group led by 
Dr Krys Kelly. The bioinformatics group currently consists of five people 
developing statistical methodology and analysing genome-wide patterns of 
small RNAs and epigenetic information in association with Prof Sir David 
Baulcombe. 

  

Applicants should have a Ph.D and substantial experience of a statistical 
language (e.g. R, Matlab). Experience in statistics, statistical genetics, 
quantitative genetics or genomics would also be beneficial.
