Vol 01S: <h2>The Geographical and Ecological Distribution of Arabidopsis and
Comments on Physiological Variation</h2><p>

D. RATCLIFFE<p>

The purpose of this paper is to outline the ecology and geographical
distribution of Arabidopsis and to emphasise the physiological
variation which the species must possess in order to be successful
over such a wide range. The ecological conclusions are based only on
experience of northern and western European habitats and conclusions
on the ecology of the plant in other areas are speculative.<p>

Figure 1: Distribution in Europe. 1 Arabidopsis thaliana, 2 Saxifraga
Tridactylites, 3 Draba muralis and 4 Hornungia petraea<p>

It can be seen from Figure 1 that Arabidopsis has a very wide range
indeed. The dotted lines show where an exact limit cannot be given
because of insufficient information in the published Floras. In
addition, it is present in Madeira, the Canary Islands, the Azores,
Cape Verde Islands, Persia, Afghanistan, Kashmir, Punjab, Western
Tibet, the Pamir-Altai area, the mountains of East Africa and Japan.
It is very difficult to know in which areas Arabidopsis is native. It
is, nevertheless, clear that the plant occurs in areas with widely
different climates, and, native or introduced, it must to some extent
be adapted to the local conditions or it would not survive.<p>

In central England, and most probably in natural habitats everywhere
else, Arabidopsis is one of a group of annuals with similar ranges of
distribution (Figure 1) and having many characteristics in common.
They are all small plants producing many small seeds, in Britain
passing the summer as seeds, the winter as rosettes of leaves, and
flowering in spring. Flowering time varies from species to species but
an after-ripening requirement of the seeds also varies in length in
such a way that germination of all the species takes place at the same
time in the autumn (Figure 2). The optimum temperature range for
germination in all species is 50*degrees*-20*degrees*C and in all
light favours germination.<p>

the approximate time (x) at which germination of many seeds becomes
possible.<p>

It seems safe to conclude that such characteristics common to a whole
group of annuals are, in fact, physiological adaptations to the
environment and if we consider Arabidopsis thaliana on its own we
might expect variations in these characteristics in parts of its
geographical range with a different climatic type. Within the European
range of Arabidopsis, I think, it is possible to distinguish two main
climate types. Figure 3 shows rainfall and temperature data for
Sheffield in central England, Bologna in Northern Italy and for
Frankfurt, Germany.<p>

Bologna has a Mediterranean climate with a marked winter rainfall
maximum, high summer temperatues and rather cool winters.  Sheffield
has a broadly similar yearly climatic cycle but the winters are
colder, the summers less warm and rather more summer rainfall, though
still with a winter rainfall maximum.<p>

Figure 3: Climatic data. The figures below refer to life cycle of
Arabidopsis in Britain: I germination, II vegetative period, III
flowering period, and IV dormancy period<p>

In Britain Arabidopsis is usually confined to places where the soil is
driest in summer and isolation is high in winter - principally on the
south facing slopes on limestone rock; here the microclimate is most
similar to the Mediterranean type.<p>

The yearly climatic cycle in central Europe is very different with a
very clear summer maximum of rainfall, high summer temperatures and
low winter temperatures.<p>

Most of the strains which have been collected and described in the
LAIBACH standard collection of races (ROBBELEN, 1965) are from central
Europe and have been described as "summer" annual races (LAIBACH (cf.
these Proceed. p. 15), however believes that they germinate in autumn
but they flower in spring or summer and do not require a cold
treatment to induce flowering). With very few exceptions all the races
which I have collected from Britain, France and Spain are clearly
winter annual germinating in autumn and flowering in spring, passing
the summer as seeds.<p>

I suggested that the reason for this difference may be found in the
yearly climatic cycle of the two areas, the winter annual habit being
fitted to the Mediterranean type and the summer annual to the central
European type. In central Europe I think it likely that the winter is
too cold and the autumn growing period too short for winter annual
types to succeed for they make most of their growth between the
beginning of September and January, initiating flowers toward the end
of this period. The after-ripening requirement of the seeds prevent
premature germination during the summer where in north-western Europe
in the habitat of Arabidopsis the soil remains moist for short
periods.<p>

Summer annual strains are characterized by their lack of need for
cold-treatment to induce flowering. This could be because favourable
conditions for growth followed by seed setting only exist in the
central European climate type in the spring and early summer and that
any cold- requirement would either not be satisfied at all because
they may be at an insensitive stage during the winter or flowering
must be accomplished quickly to allow successful seed production.
Races without a cold- requirement would not be able to produce seed if
they germinated in autumn in areas where winter annual races are
found, for they could flower when temperatures were too low for
successful seed setting. It is more difficult to know why they are
apparently absent completely from Britain, but I think the most likely
explanation is that our climate is so variable during the summer that
races of Arabidopsis which do not have physiological characteristics
ensuring that they flower and set seed during the most favourable
period of the year cannot succeed in perpetuating themselves. It is
significant that only once a race without a cold-requirement has been
found - near Cambridge, where the climate is more like that of central
Europe (this race has since been lost.  Obviously more work is needed
on the ecology of these so-called "summer" annual races.<p>

So far I have only discussed the two well known race-types of
Arabidopsis and their possible relationship to two basic climatic
types.  Obviously, climate varies from place to place within these
types and it might be expected that Arabidopsis would show correlated
variation.<p>

I have now collected 27 races from Britain and 4 from France and
Spain; all these require cold-treatment before normal flowering can
take place:<p>

4 from France and Spain are definitely winter annual with a cold-
requirement.<p>

21 from Britain are winter annual with a fairly strong cold-
requirement.<p>

6 from the Highlands of Scotland have a very marked cold- requirement.
But it is probable that germination takes place in spring and they
flower during the summer. This has been verified for one race and is
probably true of the other five.<p>

Seven of these races from widely spaced parts of Britain were given 3
weeks cold-treatment (0-5*degrees*C) as germinating seeds and
subsequently grown in continuous light at 20 *degrees*C. For 5 races
this cold treatment induced flowering in 4 to 8 weeks - flowering was
earliest in races from areas with less cold winters. Two races from
the Scottish Highlands did not flower normally but some plants began
to flower in 18 weeks, indicating that they had not had a sufficiently
long cold-treatment.<p>

Seeds of 20 races, including those from France and Spain, were sown in
boxes of soil and given about 6 weeks of low temperatures during the
winter; again the races from the areas with the least cold winters
flowered first. In general, races from the most southerly localities
particularly France and Spain flowered first and those from northern
areas much later. It might be expected that races from the
Mediterranean areas would have a low cold-requirement and would be
similar to "summer" annual races from central Europe-in fact, races
from Catania (Sicily), Cadenabbie (Spain) and Bologna (Italy) have
been described as summer annuals. These are areas with such a dry
summer and mild winter that they probably differ from the central
European races in respects other than the cold-requirement for
flowering. They are probably best thought of as winter annual races
with a low cold-requirement. There is, therefore, a wide variation in
cold-requirement probably correlated with the winter temperatures
which the populations experience.<p>

I have little information about the germination behaviour of the seeds
of these races, but the behaviour in the field of all British races is
so similar to that from central England I will be surprised if they do
not all have an after-ripening requirement. I have pointed out that
this could be related to the need to prevent premature germination.
It is not known whether races from Mediterranean areas have this
characteristic. It is possible that they have not. My information on
summer annual races is limited, but variation has been reported in
length of time to flowering (ROBBELEN, 1965), and this may be related
to local climatic conditions. The seeds of some races need to
after-ripen before germination can take place, others do not. The
seeds of some races germinate in light and not in darkness, others do
not. The significance of this variation is not known. It would be
interesting to know how common is the afterripening requirement, and
whether there is any other mechanism influencing time of germination.<p>

Many of the conclusions I have made about adaptation of Arabidopsis
races to major climatic features are very tentative and many more data
must be accumulated before any clear pattern can be distinguished.
Nevertheless, I think it useful to summarize my conclusions so far in
Figure 4.<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol01S/vol01S-pg42-fig4.gif">Click here for figure</a><p>

Figure 4: Distribution of winter annual (w), late summer (ls) and
summer annual (s) races of Arabidopsis in 4 climatic areas of Europe<p>

I have distinguished four areas and suggest that the races in these
areas have different characteristics.<p>

1. Mediterranean areas.
	Winter rainfall maximum.
	Cold winter. Hot summer.
		Winter annual races with a low cold
 		requirement for flowering.<p>

2. Western European area.
	Winter rainfall maximum.
	Cold winter, Warm summer.
		Winter annual races with a distinct cold
 		requirement for flowering and probably a
 		seed dormancy period.<p>

3. Central European area.
	Summer rainfall maximum.
	Very cold winter. Hot summer.
		Summer annual races with no cold
 			requirements for flowering. Variabile
 		seed dormancy, according to local
			conditions.<p>

4. North Western areas.
	All year round rainfall.
	Cold winter. Cool summer.
		Extreme cold requirement for flowering.
 		Summer annual or late winter annual
 		races.<p>

These are only generalisations and must be supported by much more
evidence. Recently I have learned from Arabidopsis Information Service
(CETL, I., DOBROVOLNA, G., and EFFMERTOVE, E., 1965) that in Western
Moravia winter annual races can be found. It is quite probable that
they are present in other areas of central Europe. I have also left
out entirely the areas outside Europe and here we might expect
adaptations to different climatic types.<p>

Discussion:<p>

NAPP-ZINN: You mentioned one race of Arabidopsis germinating in
spring, and in the beginning of your lecture you showed a diagram
indicating the duration of dormancy, terminating approximately in late
summer or autumn. Do you know the behaviour of your other Arabidopsis
strains with regard to germination, whether they germinate in autumn
or in spring? I have been stimulated to this question by Prof.
LAIBACHs remark this morning that all the Arabidopsis races germinate
in autumn.<p>

RATCLIFFE: All races that I have investigated in detail have been
collected in central England, they germinate in autumn. Within one or
two weeks there are usually two weeks of drought in late August or
September, and then it rains, and the soil remains continuously moist,
and many thousands of seeds of Arabidopsis and other species will
appear! It is easy to recognize the species Arabidopsis at the
cotyledon stage because of these annuals Arabidopsis is the only one
of which the cotyledones enlarge. I can therefore say that almost
everywhere in Britain it is winter germinating, but in the Highlands
at least in one race germination is in spring. It has a very high cold
requirement and probably has this partially satisfied by about June,
but then it is very wet through the summer and after ripening is not
complete up to August.  Then they don't germinate before the winter.<p>

KRANZ: Have you studied the correlation between these winter and
summer types in relation to the distribution of Arabidopsis as a weed?
I think there may be connections between the distribution of
Arabidopsis types and the distribution of winter and summer types of
the cereals, in which they occur.<p>

RATCLIFFE: I considered the possibility that the types which grow with
crops are summer annuals and those which occur in natural habitats are
winter annuals. But in Britain I think it is not one of the most
important characters. In Britain there has been only one summer annual
type found in the surroundings of Cambridge, and this is a totally
agricultural area. Your assumption may be true in parts of Europe.<p>

KRANZ: I wonder if there is any connection between the winter types
and the summer types of both plants I cannot understand the fact your
map shows. There the winter annuals are distributed in the western
areas of Europe; the summer types are mostly to be found in the center
of Europe.<p>

ROBBELEN: You were so kind, Dr. RATCLIFFE, as to supply me some seeds
of your races and I cultivated them from October up to now in the
greenhouse all through the winter time and the temperature in the
greenhouse was never less than 12*degrees*C in minimum. This was
sufficient for all except two races to have full flowering. One race
flowered a little bit and only one was entirely not flowering. Do you
have any estimate about the cold amount which is needed for
vernalization?<p>

RATCLIFFE: At least most races seem to require a period below
15*degrees*C for about 3 months and they then flower normally, but
they produce very large plants with many flowers. If you grow the
plants below 20*degrees*C, then they are much more like the plants in
the field. Can you tell me which race did not flower?<p>

ROBBELEN: These were the two races from the Scottish Highlands, the
races Craig and Lochan and Black Mount. But generally, I think, is the
amount of cold relatively small.<p>

NAPP-ZINN: Auf die Dauer bluhen alle Arabidopsis Rassen, auch die
"winterannuellsten", selbst wenn sie niemals kalter als 20*degrees*C
gehabt haben. Man kann sagen, das die zur Bluhrife fuhrenden Vorgange
bei 20*degrees*C auch noch ablaufen konnen, wenn augh schrecklich
langsam. Aber ein halbes Jahr reicht dazu aus; und wenn die Tageslange
genugt, dann bluhen sie auch, selbst ohne Kalte.<p>

ROBBELEN: That means, that the vernalization interferes with
photoperiod.<p>

RATCLIFFE: I grew plants in continuous light in a greenhouse which was
round about 10*degrees*C during the winter and this had no effect on
initition of flowers whatsoever. This requires only cold, and in
Arabidopsis daylength is important for elongation of the flowering
stems and temperature is not important. In other of these annual
species it is twofold; for instance it is temperature and not
daylength which is most important for elongation of flowering stems of
Hornungia petraea, and for other species that is true too. Principally
daylength is important in determining time of flowering in Arabidopsis
in the field in Britain.<p>

Van der VEEN: Under greenhouse conditions at 20*degrees*C, I found
late varieties like Stockholm or McKELVIEs very late mutant "F" to
flower without vernalization in 3 months time but with high light
intensity (daily light sum).<p>

LAIBACH: Arabidopsis uberwintert immer als Pflanze und nicht als Same.
Die Samen gehen alle schon im Herbst auf. Es ist also eine
winterannuelle Pflanze. Naturlich kann man, wenn man sie gut
behandelt, unter Umstanden im Jahr 8, 9 oder 10 Generationen ziehen.
Das ist eine ganz andere Sache. Hier meinen wir vegatationskundliche
Merkmale. Eine Pflanze, wie Fumaria, uberwintert immer als Same,
Arabidopsis aber uberwintert immer als Rosette, und das bei allen
Rassen.<p>

RATCLIFFE: I would point out the difference in climatic type between
central Europe and western Europe. It is such that in the autumn there
is a very quick change from fairly high temperatures in summer to
those of winter temperatures in central Europe. So there is not much
time in which Arabidopsis can flower. But in western Europe there is a
very slow change, and it can be very warm up to December.  And
certainly from September up to December the summer annual strains
which don't start to flower in the autumn in central Europe would be
likely to flower in the autumn in western Europe, but could not set
seed during the winter. In central Europe, so long as germination does
not take place too early in the summer-annual types the quick change
to the cold of winter will prevent flowering and it does not matter
that they don't require a cold requirement to induce flowering.<p>

ROBBELEN: The point as I see it now is how to define winter- annual?
Does it depend on germination or on flowering earlier than winter?
Prof. LAIBACH definierte winterannuell als eine solche Form, eren Same
vor dem Winter keimt und sich vor Einbruch des Winters noch bis au
einem gewissen Stadium entickeln kann, while you would define as
winter-annual those plants which are flowering before winter.<p>

LAIBACH: Das gilt naturlich nur dort, wo es einen Winter gibt.  Z.  B.
in der Nahe der Sahara, wo es Kaum Winter gibt, da richten sie sich
naturlich nicht danach. Winterannuell ist ja ein vegetationskundlicher
Ausdruck. Der gilt nur fur Gegenden, in denen wirklich die Temperatur
im Winter unter 0*degrees*C sinkt.<p>

RATCLIFFE: I agree entirely with Prof. LAIBACH, that they should all
be called winter-annuals. But the original mistake was to refer to the
summer-annuals as summer-annuals and in fact they are winter- annuals,
too. My definition of a summer-annual is a race which does not require
cold to induce flowering.<p>

NAPP-ZINN: I believe too, that for the definition of summer-annual and
winter-annual one should regard the cold-requirement. One can sow many
plants in autumn and they must spend the winter at a rosette stage,
because they have not the sufficient light quantity at that time, and
they will flower in spring. I think one should regard as winter-annual
only those plants which must necessarily pass the winter in order to
satisfy a cold requirement. The question is, whether the winter-annual
type should be defined merely from a descriptive point of view or on
the basis of physiologic experiments. Probably one can say, that these
terms (summer- and winter-annual) only refer to the physiology of
flowering and not the ecology.<p>
