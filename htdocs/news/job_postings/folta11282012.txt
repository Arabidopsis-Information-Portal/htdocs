*** Postdoctoral Opportunity **** 

Photomorphogenesis as Applied to High-Value Horticultural Crops 

We have support for an innovative project that requires the talents of a 
postdoctoral researcher. 

We are examining how light can control high-value characteristics of 
various horticultural crops. Experiments are fast and the results are 
meaningful to industry. The experiments exploit our unique LED system, 
providing a niche for rapid publication. All experiments are well 
underway, so you will be integrating with an established program, not 
starting from the beginning. 

A candidate MUST possess some background in photomorphogenesis or other 
aspect of light-mediated plant responses. The ideal candidate will also 
possess skills in plant physiology and molecular biology. Background in 
metabolomics or genomics a plus. Experience with HPLC or GC/MS is also a 
plus. 

The appointment is for one year starting asap and may be extended based on 
results. 

Please send a CV and cover letter asap. I will start interviewing 
immediately by skype as qualified applications are received.
