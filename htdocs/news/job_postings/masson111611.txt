A postdoctoral position is open in the Masson laboratory, Department of 
Genetics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, starting immediately, to 
investigate the molecular mechanisms that underlie root growth behavior in 
response to mechanical cues, using approaches derived from systems biology 
and genetics. Candidates should have a Ph.D. and a strong record of 
publication in peer-reviewed journals. Demonstrated experience in molecular 
genetics is required, and preference will be given to individuals with 
experience in the analysis of next-generation sequencing and/or proteomics 
datasets. Candidates should also have good communication skills and be 
willing to collaborate with other researchers. Applications should be sent 
as single pdf files to phmasson@wisc.edu. They should include a short 
statement of research interest, a vitae, and names and contact information 
for three professional references.
