	Arabidopsis thaliana, a small autogamous Crucifer (2n = 10) with a short life cycle, can be grown on an inert substrate (perlite) soaked with mineral medium (JACOBS, 1964) under sterile conditions (LANGRIDGE, 1957), and in a relatively small area.  As LAIBACH (1943) pointed out, it thus seems to be a very useful tool for experimental studies on plant development. By means of the numerous morphological and biochemical mutants recently obtained (LANGRIDGE, 1965; REDEI, 1962; JACOBS, 1965; FEENSTRA, 1964, etc.) it is moreover possible to follow the temporal succession of differentiation  (ROBBELEN, 1965 a) or to study the relations between nuclear and cytoplasmic genes (ROBBELEN, 1965 b; REDEI, 1965).<p>

	Despite this great number of genetical investigations the development of methods for the isolation and the characterization of Arabidopsis nucleic acids has received little attention.  DNA and ribosomal RNA were first isolated by one of us (BONOTTO, 1964 and 1965) following the method of MARMUR (1961) and that of LYTTLETON and PETERSEN (1964) respectively.  At the same time WALLES and AHNSTROM (1965) isolated DNA from the seeds, purifying it moreover from contaminant polysaccharides.<p>

	Groups of 100 plants of Arabidopsis, Wil-2, 8 to 13 days old, were homogenized at 4*degrees*C by hand in a glass homogenizer fitted with a Teflon pestle using 2.5 ml of the following medium:  Na acetate buffer, 0.01 M, pH 5.0; glucose, 0.54 M; EDTA, 0.0001 M; and naphtalene disulfonate, 1 mg/ml.  Non-disrupted membranes were again homogenized with 2.5 ml of the same medium and the homogenates were pooled.  Homogenization was carried out as rapidly as possible.<p>

	Recrystallized sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) was then added to a concentration of 1%.  Freshly redistilled phenol (5 ml : phenol 85-H20 15 v/v) was then added to the homogenate, which was shaken at 4*degrees*C for 5 min.  The aqueous layer was recovered after centrifugation for 10 min at 10.000 rev./min in a refrigerated centrifuge (International) and again treated with phenol in the same way.  The recovered aqueous layer was then shaken with 5 ml of a mixture of chloroform and isoamyl alcohol (35:1, v/v) for 5 min at 4*degrees*C and recentrifuged in the same way.<p>

	The nucleic acids were precipitated from the aqueous phase by the addition of 0.1 vol. of 10% NaCl and 2.5 vol. of absolute alcohol at -20*degrees*C for at least 3 hrs, although an overnight precipitation at -20*degrees*C was preferable for a quantitative recovery.<p>

	The precipitate, collected by centrifugation and washed twice with cold absolute alcohol in order to eliminate eventual contaminant phenol, was dissolved in 0.3 ml of the following buffer:  Na acetate buffer, 0.01 M, pH 5.0; EDTA, 0.0001 M; and naphtalene disulfonate, 10 micro g/ml.  The extract, clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 2.500 to 3.000 rev./min was layered on top of 4.6 ml of a 5-20% sucrose gradient and centrifuged for 5 hrs at 37.500 rev./min in the SW 39 rotor of the Spinco ultracentrifuge.  The bottom of the tubes was punctured and 2 drop-fractions were collected.  To each fraction 250 micro l of water was added and the absorption at 260 m micro was read in a Beckman DU spectophotometer.<p>

	Figure 1 shows the centrifugation pattern of the RNA extracted from 10-day-old plants, from which primary roots were cut before extraction.  Since sedimentation constants have not been determined, we have designated the two ribosomal RNA's as heavy RNA (hr-RNA) and light RNA (lr-RNA).  The r-RNA (hr-RNA + lr-RNA) can be easily isolated from s-RNA by standing overnight at 4*degrees*C in 2M NaCl.<p>

	Figure 2 shows ultraviolet spectra of hr-RNA, lr-RNA, and s-RNA.  The s-RNA showed a maximum of absorption at 270 m micro, possibly due to phenol contamination or to the fact that it may be particularly rich in aminoacyl-s-RNA.<p>

	In conclusion, the method reported here should be useful in studying both normal and abnormal (REDEI, 1966) RNA metabolism in this plant.<p>
