Wheat sequencing project.
 
1 Post-doctoral and  1 technician position at the University of Liverpool (Neil Hall and Anthony 
Hall)
You will join the world class genome sequencing facility and will work on a flagship 
£1.7 million grant funded by the BBSRC to analyse the genome of wheat using next 
generation 454 sequencing.  The project is in collaboration with the University of Bristol 
(Edwards and Barker) and the John Innes Centre (Bevan). This is one of the most 
ambitious next generation sequencing projects to date and we are looking for high-
calibre, motivated and ambitious candidates. The post is available for up to 2 years.
You should hold a PhD in a bioinformatics or related subject area and have experience of 
genome analysis.  Knowledge of plant/crop science and programming will be 
advantageous.
