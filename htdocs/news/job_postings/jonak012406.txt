POST - DOCTORAL POSITION

Stress Signal Transduction and Adaptation in Arabidopsis


Our group is studying the molecular mechanisms of plant stress signal transduction. The class of 
glycogen synthase kinase 3/shaggy-like kinases (GSKs) has recently emerged as a new class of 
important stress signaling components (Jonak and Hirt (2002), TIPS, 7, 457-461). We have shown 
that GSKs are involved in mediating plant stress responses. In a molecular-genetic approach, 
we are functionally analysing stress-activated GSK-signaling pathways as well as the cross-talk 
with other signaling cascades and study the impact of GSK action on physiological responses. 
A 2-3 year postdoctoral position is now available within a network project investigating the 
consequences of various stress conditions on the (epi)genome in plants. In collaboration with 
expert groups in the field of (epi)genetics you will perform stress treatments and evaluate 
plant stress tolerance as well as investigate the role of GSK action in adaptive processes 
at the molecular/biochemical and physiological level. The project starts in spring 2006.
 
Qualifications:
The successful candidate has a strong background in molecular biology and/or biochemistry. 
Experience with Arabidopsis abiotic and/or biotic stress physiology is highly desirable. 
Practical knowledge of Arabidopsis genetics is certainly a big plus.
