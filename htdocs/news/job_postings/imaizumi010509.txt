Post-doc position
 
Department of Biology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA
 
A postdoctoral position is immediately available in the Department of Biology, 
University of Washington, Seattle. The principle investigator, Takato Imaizumi, recently 
moved to University of Washington from Dr. Steve Kay’s lab at University of California, 
San Diego. The Imaizumi group is studying the molecular mechanisms of photoperiodic 
flowering and the circadian clock. The successful candidate will join a project that aims 
to further elucidate the molecular role of the newly identified blue-light photoreceptor 
FKF1 (Flavin-binding, Kelch repeat, and F-box 1) (see details in Imaizumi et al. 2003 
Nature 426: 302-306, Imaizumi et al. 2005 Science 309:293-297, and Sawa et al. 2007 
Science 318:261-265) in photoperiodic flowering using biochemistry, molecular genetic 
and genomic approaches.
 
This project is supported by both the NIH and University of Washington and the position 
could be extended up to three years. Salary will be based on departmental pay scales. We 
are looking for highly motivated individuals who can work synergistically with current 
members. Experience working with Arabidopsis is not required.
 
Individuals who are interested in this position should send a Curriculum Vitae, a brief 
statement of scientific accomplishment and research interest (1-2 pages), and names and 
contact information for three references to Takato Imaizumi (takato@u.washington.edu). 
The starting date is negotiable, though the earliest possible is preferred. Review will 
continue until a suitable applicant has been found.
