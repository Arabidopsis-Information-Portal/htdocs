A recessive mutant ms causing male sterility has been induced by X-ray
treatment (12 kR on presoaked seeds) of "Dijon G".  The M2 family
segregated into 12 fertile and 5 sterile plants.  Pollination of the
sterile plants with wild-type pollen resulted in 96.5 % seed setting
(250 ovules studied).  30 F1 plants were grown to maturity; all proved
to be fertile. The F2 segregated into 22 fertile and 13 sterile
plants. The result of the backross "sterile x F1" was 134 fertile: 146
sterile.<p>

Table :  Classification of anthers<p>

The flowers of the ms ms plants contain 6 anthers of =/- reduced size,
which open somewhat delayed.  126 anthers (2 per flower) from the
basal flowers of 10 sterile plants were studied microscopically. As
shown in the Table, the number of pollen grains pwer anther varied
from zerio to 148 (control: 431 +/-12).  Most of the pollen grains
were abortive and of reduced size, but some were stainable with
acetocarmin and, therefore, classified as normal. With respect to the
mean number jof abortive and normal pollen grains per anthr, there
were no significant differences between various ms ms plants. &#197;fter
natural selfin 835 seeds from about 280.000 ovules were harvested
(seed setting: 0.3%). The genotype of these seeds was confirmd as ms
ms.  In a second sowing performed in winter seed setting was only
0.005% (7 seeds from about 150.000 ovules).  Thus, it is difficult to
propagage the mtuant by natural selfing, although sterility is not
complete.<p>

Growth rate, vegetative characters and flower morphology are entirely
normal.  Only the terminal flowers of all inflorescences are regularly
malformed. They consist of +/- effeminated organs.  The margin of the
sepals forms small white ovules and often a papillose stigma. The
petals and stamens are partially aborted.<p>
