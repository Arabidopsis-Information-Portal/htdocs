<h1 align=center>JIC YACs to cosmids on Chr. IV</h1>

<br><center><img src="/images/line.red2.gif" alt="[line]"></center>
<p>

YACs from the EW YAC library were chosen from across the physical map
of chromosome 4 of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. They were used as
hybridisation probes on filters containing DNA from representative
cosmids of contigs generated in the Goodman laboratory. Cosmids that
showed a positive hybridisation signal were requested from the Goodman
laboratory and they were used in Southern confirmation
experiments. The results of this work are shown below.
