In summer 1968 on the experimental site of our highland research
station Siya Kuh (2500 m above sea level), a spontaneous mutant was
discovered among plants of race &#180;Enkheim showing retarded leaves
and an unusual type of influorescence.  In most cases, three siliques
as well as some single ones were formed.  If in the first type one
fruit failed to appear, a double silique resulted (Figure).  The
branching of the stem was also altered. When grown in tubes, the
mutant started fruiting on the 28th day after sowing, i.e., 3 days
later than the control. Crossing with the wild type revealed a
recessive pattern of inheritance. The absolute penetrance and high
fertility make this mutant a useful marker for the genetic analysis.<p>
