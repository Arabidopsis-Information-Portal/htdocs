Natural Variation in AM Symbiosis in Medicago truncatula 
A post-doctoral position is available to explore natural variation in AM 
symbiosis in Medicago truncatula. The project was initiated several years 
ago and seeks to determine the molecular basis of natural diversity among 
AM symbioses in M. truncatula, through genome-wide association mapping 
(GWAS). So far, over 170 M. truncatula accessions have been phenotyped for 
AM symbiosis and SNP's associated with several AM symbiosis phenotypes have 
been identified through GWAS. Analysis of candidate genes is in progress. 
Requirements: Applicants must have a Ph.D., demonstrated expertise in 
genetics, experience with plant-microbe interactions and a strong 
publication record. Expertise with association mapping and a strong 
statistical background are beneficial but not essential. 
To Apply: Applicants should submit a CV, the names of three references and 
a letter summarizing research interests and relevant experience to Dr. 
Maria J. Harrison, (mjh78@cornell.edu.) (Job # 2012-24). 
Project Location: The Boyce Thompson Institute is a non-profit research 
institute affiliated Cornell University, Ithaca, New York,
