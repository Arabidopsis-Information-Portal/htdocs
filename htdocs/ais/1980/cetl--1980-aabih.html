Discussing genecological problems connected with the clinal character
of flowering-time variability in natural populations of A. thaliana
from Moravia, it was suggested that the accompanying plant species and
the kind of the plant cover seem to be very important in the clinal
distribution (Cetl, 1978). For this reason, we attempted to correlate
the date on the plant cover given by Mikyska et al. (1968), 1972) with
the charactristics of the flowering time of particular population
samples of A. thaliana from Moravia (n=258).<p>

Mikyska's geobotanical map is a 1:200,000 reconstruction map. "The aim
of a map of reconstructed natural vegetation is to obtain a survey of
vegetation in a region which is entirely balanced biologically. A
reconstruction map has to express the function of particular elements
of vegetation in the region and to describe the latter as a result of
autonome vegetation forces. Thus the map does not show the actual
vegetation potency in all cases but the primary situation or the
primary developmental tendency of natural vegetation as caused by the
locality. In the most cases, however, the reconstructed vegetation
agrees with the potential natural vegetation or there are only minor
differences which might be expressed only in large-scale maps."
(Mikyska et al., 1968, p. 16).<p>

The given character of the maps was thus advantageous from the point
of view of a detailed description of the plant cover in particular
localities carrying local populations of A. thaliana within the
territory studied as not only the present state but also the
developmental tendencies of vegetation were taken into account
regardless of possible human influences.<p>

The data given in the maps were correlated with the percent of
generative plants after 28 days from germination under the
experimental growth conditions (25 +/- 3*degrees*C, continuous
illumination 1250 lux), g28. This index of flowering time was chosen
for the reason that the 28th day from germination represents a
threshold separating the group of summer-annual and that of
winter-annual genotypes of A. thaliana as related to Moravian lowland
localities (Cetl, 1978).<p>

The exact position of the particular localities was transferred from
the hyposometric maps 1:100,000 in the geobotanical map 1:200,000
(Mikyska et al., 1972) and the appurtenance of poulation samples and
their localities to plant communities was found in this way.<p>

The results are given in Table 1. The distribution of particular
population samples among the groups of plant communities was found to
be nonrandom both quantitatively and qualitatively.<p>

In total, the 258 population samples could be divided among ten
different groups of plant communities. The corresponding percentages
are given in the last row of Table 1. More than one third of
population samples was found to lie in Carpinion betuli (C),
approximately one fourth in Quercion robori-petraea (Qa), one tenth in
Eu-Fagion (F) and Luzulo-Fagion (LF), respectively, while other
groups, i.e., Eu-Quercion pubescentis etc. (Qp), Potentillo-Quercetum
etc. (Q), Luzulo-Fagetum montanum etc. (Fm), Alno-Padion etc. (AU),
Eu-Fagion (F), Luzulo-Fagion (LF), Eu-Vaccinio-Piceion (Pc) and
Oxycocco-Sphagnetea etc. (V), were represented only by few population
samples.<p>

Table 1: Distribution of population samples according to the percent
of generative plants after 28 days from germination under experimental
conditions (25 +/- 3*degrees*C, continuous illumination 1250 l-x, g28)
and to the appurtance of their localities to plant communties given by
Miksyka et al. (1968, 1972).<p>

Three types of groups of plant communities could be distinguished. In
the first type comprising Qp and Q, winter-annual genotypes (g28 near
to 0) were prevailing; in the other type comprising C, Qa and AU,
respectively, the g28 values were distributed over the whole range
from 0 to 100; in the last type comprising Fm, F, LF, Pc and V,
respectively, summer-annual genotypes (g28 near to 100) were
prevailing.<p>

This matter of fact seems to contribute to our suggestion explaining
the rise of the clinal distribution of A. thaliana natural populations
as to their flowering-time variability within the territory studied.
An upward direction of colonization from lowland to highland was
supposed to be very probable (Cetl, 1978, p. 104). Now, in agreement
with the distribution of particular population samples among different
groups of plant communities, it seems that, above all, Carpinion
betuli and Quercion robori-petraeae served as a channel through which
the upward colonization took place.<p>

"Ancient" polymorphic lowland populations with a low percent of summer
annuals lying in &#180;u-Quercion pubescentis and in
Potentillo-Quercetum served as a resource for the upward colonization.
The outcome of this upward colonization was that A. thaliana got as
far as to the highland Fageta, Piceta and Vaccinieta and produced
natural populations with a high percent of summer annuals there. On
the other hand, Alno-Padion carrying, like to Carpinion betuli and
Quercion robori-petraeae population samples with g28 from 0 to 100,
might serve as a channel of downward colonizations taking place also
recently (Cetl, 1978, p. 99).<p>

The data presented in this paper will be used also in the designed
partial correlation analysis (Cetl, 1978, p. 101). For the present,
the result of the simple correlation analysis, by use of data from
Table 1, leading to r +/- sr = .5749 +/- .0359 can be given.<p>
