ABSTRACT<p>

Unusual phenotypes with morphological abnormalities in F 2 were
observed upon crossing a mutant line with a multimarker line. The
genetic factors responsible for the abnormal traits in subsequent
generation exhibit incomplete penetrance and varying mosaic-like
expression.<p>

INTRODUCTION<p>

The occurrence of forms in F 2 with new, unusual phenotypes were
described in a number of studies (Anderson, 1949; Mangelsdorf, 1958).
This kind of variability is generally called abnormal one. The
mechanism responsible for this phenomenon is unclear, although it has
been suggested to be due to recombination in gene systems with strong
non-allelic interactions (Zhuchenko, 1980). Such type of variability
has been found in di- and tri-hybrid crosses of Arabidopsis thaliana
(Usmanov and Startsev, 1979; Startsev, 1986). The authors attribute
the appearance of unusual plant phenotypes to the interaction of the
genes under study. Similar unusual morphological abnormalities in F 2
have been observed by us upon crossing the mutant line 9.5.9 with the
multimarker line gll'hy2'tt5'er, which led us to undertake further
genetic studies.<p>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<p>

All seeds of randomly sampled F 1 siliques from 9.5.9 x gll'hy2tt5'er
cross were used in our studies. For the phenotypes of marker genes and
mutation see Koornneef's (1983) and Usmanov's (1984) papers,
respectively.<p>

Seeds were sown on Petri dishes containing solution-soaked (KNO 3,
0.1% filter paper, and germinated following the synchronization
technique (Petrov and Vizir, 1982). Plants were grown in soil culture
under continuous fluorescent light at room conditions.<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

Experiment 1<p>

Table 1: Inheritance of abnormal traits over generation.<p>

Phenotypes with abnormal cotyledons, leaves, stems, flowers and
silique frequently occured in F 3, F 4, F 5 populations (Table 1,
Figure 1 A-D). The unusual traits observed at seedling stages often
made it possible to predict abnormalities at later stages.<p>

Experiment 2<p>

In another crossing of the same type, plants with abnormalities
dissimilar to those of Experiment 1 appeared in one of the six F 2
families. F 1 silique distribution of abnormal individuals was
nonrandom, which implies clustering of events inducing respective
changes. In B 2 population (F 1 x gll'hy2'tt5er), obtained by crossing
to the same F 1 plant from which F 2 population containing abnormal
plants was harvested, abnormal plants occurred at a rate of .2%. It is
unclear whether this result is due to incidental pollination of
emasculated F 1 flowers by pollen from near but non emasculated ones.
This requires further investigation to be able to answer certainty.
Non random distribution of abnormal forms among F 2 plants obtained
from seeds coming from different F 1 siliques, as well as nearly
complete absence of such form in the respective backcross population
suggests that some mutation (in heterozygous state) was involved. The
mutation seems to be a recessive one, since it was not expressed in
the F 1 plant. This hypothetic mutation resulted in tessellated
troubles in the formation of cotyledons, leaves, stams and flowers for
which we called it fdil 1 (factor differentiaion instability 1, allele
1). The plants carrying this mutation in homozygous state being fully
sterile, the fdil mutation inheritance was analysed when examining the
progeny from fdil/+ plants in famiies segregating for fdil. The
genetic analysis of the fdil mutation in the F 2 progeny from F 1
siliquaes carrying this mutation showed a significant deviation from
the Mendelian ratio (P fdil= 13.43%, X 2 3:1=14.34). No linkage of
fdil with chromosome 3 markers or 9.5.9 mutation has been detected.<p>

The data set presented allows to suggest that the above phenomenon
represents a kind of genetic instability. This instability system is
somewhat similar to "hybrid dysgenesis" discovered in common wheat
(Hisashi and Tsunewaki, 1985).<p>

CONCLUSIONS<p>

1. Forms with new, unusual traits corresponding to none of original
mutant phenotypes, or combination of these occur in F 2 from the 9.5.9
x gll hy2'tt5'er cross.<p>

2. The genetic factors responsible for abnormal traits exhibit
incomplete penetrance and varying, mosaic like expression.<p>

3. The inheritance of abnormal traits in subsequent generations is
unstable: plants with normal traits, as well as plants with other
abnormalities occasionally appear.<p>

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS<p>

We are very grateful to Dr. M. Koornneef kindly providing us with a
large collection of multimarker lines one of which was used in the
present work, as well as to Dr. P.D. Usmanov for the 9.5.9. mutant
line which was also employed in this study.<p>
