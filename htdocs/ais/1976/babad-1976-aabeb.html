In order to understand photosynthesis' intensity regulation mechanisms
it is necessary to investigate properties and regulation mechanism of
Calvin cycle key enzyme action: ribosophosphate-isomerase
(k.e.5.3.1.6), phosphoribulokinase (k.3.2.7.1.19), and
ribulosediphosphate-carboxylase (k.e. 4.1.19). One of the approaches
for undertanding the characteristics of these enzyme's regulation
activity is the use of mutants with different types of deviations in
structure and in photosynthesis apparatus function.<p>

The purpose of the investigation of potential photosynthesis intensity
and phosphoribulokinase activity (PRK) in the initial form Enkheim
(Arabidopsis thaliana, and its monohybrid segregating chlorophyll
mutant 58/15, induced by 1% ethyl-methanesulfonate solution.  PRK
catalyzes the end reaction of CO2-ribuloso-1, 5-diphosphate (RuDP)
acceptor regeneration. The investigation of this enzyme activity is of
great interest as PRK is one of the most readily regulated Calvin
cycle enzyme.<p>

Since PRK is the most labile enzyme of carboxylation phase in
photosynthesis it was necessary to study the dependence of its
activity on the methods of enzyme preparation.<p>

Method I was described earlier by BABDZHANOVA, HAITOVA, and GORENKOVA
(1971).<p>

Method II differs from Method I in the use of capron powder for leaf
trituration to make them free of phenolic compounds.<p>

In addition to this Method III includes the use of (NH4)2SO4 to purify
the enzyme.<p>

Table 1: The dependence of PRK activity on the method of enzyme
preparations producing from leaves of the initial form Enkheim
Arabidopsis thaliana.<p>

The data in Table 1 show that the highest PRK activity is observed in
the preparations with the capron powder used. The decrease of the
enzyme activity at the addition of (NH4)2SO4 is hard to be explained.
For comparative studies PRK preparations were produced by method II.<p>

Table 2 shows the results of the investigation of the photosynthesis
potential intensity and PRK activity from the initial form Enkheim A.
thaliana and its mutant 58/15.<p>

It turned out that the initial forms of Enkheim and its mutant 58/15
do not differ in the photosynthetic intensity.  The PRK activity from
the mutant 58/15 is 3.5-5 times higher than the enzyme activity from
Enkheim.  In this connection it was of interest to study the kinetics
of enzyme action from both preparations.<p>

Figure 1 shows the ratio of the reaction product accumulation under
standard experimental conditions in the case of PRK from Enkheim for 4
min. and in the case of PRK from mutant 58/15 2 min.  The results of
the kinetic studies suppose that the increase in PRK activity of the
mtuant is due to the enzyme affinity to the substrate.<p>

The gene analysis data show that mutant 58/15 has appeared as a result
of a single nuclear mutation in the fifth linkage group.  Bradbur
(1971) has found that PRK biosynthesis is proceeded on 70-S ribosomes,
i.e., it is regulated by the DNA of chloroplasts.<p>

The increase in PRK activity in mutant 58/15 of Arabidopsis thaliana
supports the view that the enzyme activity is regulated by a common
interaction of nuclear and plastidic genetic factors.<p>
