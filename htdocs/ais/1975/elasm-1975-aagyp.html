This paper continues the first publication in AIS (EL ASMI, 1974).  It
describes experiences conducted as incomplete diallel crosses
(GRIFFING, 1956, methode 2: directo crosses and parents only used)
which has been realized for five inbred lines of Arabidopsis thaliana
including A5 (Dijon, France), A9 (Eastland, Baltique), A64 (Edinburgh,
Scotland), A51 (Bologna, Italia), A80 (Turin, Italia).<p>

We must summarize briefly, that this experiment has been conducted as
a complete randomized block design under artificial light of 8000 lux
during 16 hours a day. Some of those crosses had shown a very
important hetrosis, examined on the rosette diameter length, 19 days
after sowing (EL ASMI, 1974).<p>

In the present paper, we intend to give some further results which are
very important in relation to heterosis expression in the following
stages of growth in those plants observed.<p>

For this purpose, the rosette diameter length (cm) has been measured
each two days. This operation has been realized regularly from sowing
to the stage at which diameter length is stopped in its growth (about
50 days after sowing).  Observations had been made in the hybrids as
well as in the parents, with in each case, about 16 repititions
(blocks).  Those results yield, in each case, a good statistic mean
for the study of the expression of the diameter length at this period.<p>

Figure 1 shows the growth of the hybrid (A9 x A51) comparatively to
their parents.  Values of the graph are the mean of the repeated
measures obtained in each case.  Figure 2 shows the growth in the
cross (A9 x A80). We have chosen these two crosses as an example and
particularly because of their difference in spite of using the same
parent A9.  The two graphs show with great evidence that in the case
of the hybrid A9 x A80 as well as in the case of A9 x A51, growth rate
is always superior to that of the parents in each case and this
difference remains in the same manner from the beginning of the growth
to the sterilization of the diameter length at the final observation
(about 50 days after sowing).<p>

Careful quantitative examination of differences between the hybrids
and their parents for the rosette diameter length at the final stage
of growth gives many important results as follows.  Table 1 shows the
means of the rosette diameter length, according to the incomplete
diallel model described.<p>

sowing)<p>

As it has been studied for the rosette diameter length at an early
stage (EL ASMI, 1974) we have estimated the quantity of heterosis
expressed on the phenotype according to FALCONER (1)<p>

These results and their analysis are summarized in table 2.
Comparisons of the means according to a t-test of Student has been
executed between the hybrid mean and the mid parent in each case as
follows:<p>

Table 2: Analysis of the quantity of heterosis (N.S.: not significant,
S: significant at 5%, TS: at 1% and HS: at 1%)<p>

The data of table 2 show for each cross the superiority expressed in
1% of the hybrid mean relatively to its parent's mean value with the
exception of A5 x A80.  From these results we can see easily that the
same effect of heterosis is significant for the two stages. There is
no difference if we compare with the significance at 19 days.
According to these results we must conclude that the heterosis
expressed by the hybrid genotype has a clear advantage relatively to
the parents (i.e. it is maintained as such) from the beginning until
the final stage of growth.  It doesn't disappear during growth and on
the contrary differences between the hybrid and parent's mean value
increase positively.<p>

Furthermore, there is an important positive correlation between the
rosette diameter length at 19 days and the final diameter for the ten
hybrids presented as well as for the quantity of heterosis expressed
by HF1 as it is shown in Figure 3.<p>
