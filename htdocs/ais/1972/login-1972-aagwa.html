As previously was reported, large-scale genetic-physiological
investigations of species and ecotypes of Arabidopsis are being
carried out in Tajikistan (USMANOV, LOGINOV et al., 1970).  Special
attention was paid to study the processes of photosynthesis and its
relationship to the environmental factors.  In this connection, this
work was designed mainly to study the behaviour of different species
and ecotypes of different areas of habitat, if growing them for many
years in the similar climate conditions and in different vertical
zones of the Hissar mountain range.<p>

Experiments were carried out in Dushanbe (740 m above sea-level) in
the mountain station Siya Kuh (2500 m), and on the Anzob Peak of the
Hissar range (3400 m).  The results described in Table 1 show that
magnitudes of the maximal potential photosynthesis, obtained at the
optimal inner and outer factors, are practically equal.  But species
and ecotypes in different vertical zones showed different assimilative
capacity.  For instance, ecotype Rangon-Tau which grows not higher
than 1100 m above sea level, most actively assimilated CO2 in Dushanbe
(250 +/- 10 mg CO2/g hr).  On the opposite, on the Anzob Peak the
activity of the assimilating apparatus in this ecotype is greatly
reduced, that is probably the result of strong UV-radiation action, as
well as the significant amplitude of temperatures.<p>

Table 1: Eco-physiological characteristics of species and ecotypes of
Arabidopsis<p>

Growing for many years the species and ecotypes in the similar climate
and environmental conditions on the mountain station Sija Kuh showed
that zones of optimal temperatures for photosynthesis become almost
equal with time. Thus, in the 1st year of growing the difference of
temperature optimums for photosynthesis was 9-10*degrees*C, whereas
after 5-year-growing this difference did not exceed 3-4*degrees*C.<p>

Results of these investigations confirm once again the phenomenon of
physiological adaptation of plants, which grow under similar climate
conditions and belong to one florocenotype.<p>
