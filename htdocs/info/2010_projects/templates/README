Notes on index.html.template:

genesearch.pl uses the HTML::Template module to allow us to separate
the HTML from the (admittedly ugly) perl script.  If you plan to
modify index.html.template, you'll see some weird tags in there which
should be explained before making drastic changes.

These tags will get substituted by HTML::Template right before we
print to screen.  For example, where one sees:

    <TMPL_VAR NAME=ACCESSION_NUMBER>

the "template variable" will be replaced by an accession number.  If
you'd like more details about this process, you can look at the
documentation from "perldoc HTML::Template", or shout at me at
dyoo@acoma.  *grin*


Everything between the tags "<TMPL_IF NAME=IS_QUERY_PERFORMED>" and
"</TMPL_IF>" will be displayed only if we're actually doing a query.

Everything between the tags "<TMPL_LOOP name=ROWS>" and "</TMPL_LOOP>"
will be repeated over and over for every row in the query result.
