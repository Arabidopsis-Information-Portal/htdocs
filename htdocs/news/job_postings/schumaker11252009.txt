A postdoctoral associate position is available at the University of
Arizona
as part of a Department of Energy-funded project to study endogenous
programs that control plant growth and development and how those
programs
are altered to enable the plant to grow in non-optimal conditions
(http://www.ag.arizona.edu/research/schumaker/). A major focus of our
work
is to understand the roles of the Calcineurin B-Like calcium binding
proteins in the establishment of developmental specificity during
calcium-mediated signaling in Arabidopsis. We are looking for a highly
motivated individual with a Ph.D. degree and a demonstrated ability to
carry
out outstanding research in the fields of plant development, genetics
or
related disciplines. Proven experience with molecular biology
techniques
and demonstrated written and oral communication skills are essential
qualifications. Ability to interact and work collaboratively with
others is
also critical. The position is available February 1, 2010.

To apply, send a curriculum vitae and the names and contact
information
(address, phone, fax and e-mail) for three references to Karen
Schumaker,
Ph.D. (schumake@ag.arizona.edu), School of Plant Sciences, University
