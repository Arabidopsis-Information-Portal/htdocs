Vol 01S: <h2>Submicroscopic Structure of Mutant Chloroplasts</h2><p>

G. ROBBELEN<p>

Chloroplasts in the palisade cells of Arabidopsis leaves have been
compared light-, fluroescence- and electron microscopically in the
green wild type and in several mutant forms.<p>

In the first instance this report, in comparison to the normal green
initial form, refers to the chloroplasts of the vital chlorina mutant
ch3, which had also been the object of the forementioned
investigations of Dr. VELEMINSKY. While in the chloroplasts of the
wild type form a regular distribution of grana was revealed, this
normal grana differentiation is lacking in the mutant. In the electron
microscope three different types of chloroplasts can be distinguished:
the thylakoid system can remain largely undifferentiated (type I);
stacking processes can take place, that deviate from the wild type
grana (type II); in special cases this stacking leads to a
predominantly conjunctive arrangement, yet with the aspect of "normal
grana" in side view (type III). On the basis of complete series of
cross sections spatial models were made for the complicated stacking
of chloroplast type II, and the development was explained by
invagination and sliding over processes. The detailed data of these
investigations are just in press (WEHREMEYER and ROBBELEN, 1965;
ROBBELEN and WEHRMEYER, 1965).<p>

Just as the retardation of chloroplast differentiation in this
chlorina mutant enables to elucidate the process of grana formation,
many other kinds of genetic blockade of devlopment may be useful for
studying chloroplast morphogenesis and function. Within the range of
the albina, xantha and viridis mutants the differentiation of
chloroplasts is blocked at various points representing a series of
increasing potentialities of membrane formation. The practice,
however, of characterizing such mutants with a single chloroplast
picture of dubious origin, which is frequently found in literature,
may be very bewildering indeed. This can be demonstrated by two
examples:<p>

1) It is not only the age of plants and the culturing conditions,
which vary the chloroplast structure, as has been shown in the earlier
lecture by Dr. VELEMINSKY, but as well the kind of cell used for
analysis. Therefore for comparisons we generally use palisade cells
only. But even within one single cell interactions between different
chloroplasts are demonstrable. This for example is the case in "mixed
cells" with two kinds of genetically different plastids, in the
plastom mutant, I dealt with in my first lecture. The typical aspect
of entirely inhibited white and normal green chloroplasts is only
obtained if the number of both types is about equal. When, however,
the number of normal chloroplasts increases, the blockade in the
mutant chloroplasts, probably in virtue of nutritional conditions, is
postponed to a reasonable extent. Conversely with many mutated
chloroplasts in one cell the green ones are heavily damaged apparently
by diffusable substances from the mutated ones, thus inhibiting the
unmutated plastids at an early differentiation stage.<p>

2) Many external factors are known to influence the chloroplast
morphogenesis. We have investigated light quality effects on the
aforementioned chlorina mutant ch3. Within a lethal xantha mutant
peculiar figures have been revealed after sucrose feeding. Not only
that the outer envelope got highly deformable, the tubulae of the
prolamellar body fused in such a way that in cross sections
rope-ladder figures appeared, originating from small membrane pieces
shaped like a wash- board with many ribs or ripples. Even within one
plastid the variability of the prolamellar bodies was conspicuous.
Besides, condensation products appeared in the matrix, looking similar
to those reported by PERNER, (1962) in isolated chloroplasts of
spinach. A large amount of osmiophilic globuli pointed towards the
fact of inhibition, which was strengthened by higher light
intensities.<p>

Discussion:<p>

KRANZ: Have you controlled the senescence of chloroplasts during
ontogenesis?<p>

ROBBELEN: I studied 10 or 14 days old seedlings. All the investigated
plants were in the same developmental stage. The chloroplasts,
however, might be differently developed. Indeed, frequently the
morphogenesis of chloroplasts was inhibited; nevertheless, the
plastids sometimes may reach a higher differentiation state in later
stages.<p>

FEENSTRA: Can you induce by some external factors, for instance light,
the mutant characters in the wild type, in other words, can you make
phenocopies?<p>

ROBBELEN: Of course you can inhibit the membrane growth by deficiency
of light. On the contrary, you can normalize the mutants by sucrose
feeding. However, these strange piles of grana thylakoids that we
found in our mutant, have never been observed during normal
development. The difficulty is, of course, that in the normal system
the regulation is so well done, that you can't get it in one definite
direction and make it stand there for a longer time.<p>

REDEI: Could you comment a little bit, how these chloroplast mutants
originate? It is accepted generally that the mutation affects protein
synthesis. Could this be true for the extrachromosomal mutants too.
Plastids are in the same cell, it would be difficult to have these
small cellular structures of different nature side by side without
completing each other.<p>

ROBBELEN: In my earlier lecture I pointed towards that scheme of GIBOR
and GRANICK. If one supposes that we have DNA in plastids, and if I
may cite the news that I got from Dr. LANGRIDGE last evening (see
below) that probably the function of DNA in plastids is different of
the DNA-ribosome-pathway of protein synthesis in nucleus dependent
systems, then we can point towards the fact, that the plastom
mutations are exclusively structural ones, while the function of the
plastid seemed to be ruled by the structural genes in the platids,
that do not mutate. The mutation after their hypothesis occurs in the
inducible operon that is concerned with the development of the
plastids, and the development, of course, may be correlated with the
inherent protein synthesis which is going on within the plastid itself
but by different mechanism (cf. Figure 1).<p>

(changed after GIBOR and GRANICK, 1964)<p>

REDEI: If something would be synthesized in the one and not in the
other plastid, it would diffuse from one to the other, if these are
some small molecules.<p>

ROBBELEN: I think you should more stress the possiblity, that the
template is not present in the one, but in the other chloroplast.<p>

REDEI: But how goes the amino acid into the plastid?<p>

ROBBELEN: The supply of amino acids must not be different but the
mutated plastid is unable to compose these amino acids in the normal
manner because of differences in the template.<p>

REDEI: How are the proteins made in the normal plastids?<p>

LANGRIDGE: I have seen some data suggesting that the RNA composition
of the plastids is not complementary to the DNA. KIRK (Biochem.
Biophys. Res. Comm. 16, 233, 1964) has reported, that whereas muclear
preparations give good agreement between the ratio of adenine to
guanine incorporated into RNA and the adenine to guanine ratio of the
DNA, there is no such agreement for chloroplast preparations. So there
may be no messenger going from chloroplast into the cytoplasm, but an
in situ synthesis of protein. This would be analogue to the
self-contained protein-forming system found in some seed endosperms.<p>

REDEI: The bulk of the RNA should not be complementary of the DNA, and
bulk of the RNA is not a messenger RNA. Actually there are still gaps
here which should be bridged.<p>

LANGRIDGE: I understood so from hearsay, but I have not yet seen it
published, that also a DNA complementary RNA fraction has been
searched for in chloroplasts, it has not been found.<p>

BROWN: I think the results obtained by SMILLIE, EVANS and LYMAN
(Brookhaven Symp. Biol. 16, 89-108, 1964) with Euglena certainly
indicated a net synthesis of new protein in light induced chloroplast
formation, and this was preceeded by a synthesis of RNA which could be
inhibited by actinomycin D. Their conclusion was that at least some of
the new RNA synthesised in chloroplast formation is DNA directed but
whether all the plastid located messenger RNA formed in light induced
greening of Englena is synthesised on plastid DNA is not certain.
Perhaps also some plastid RNA is a template, like viral RNA?<p>

BONOTTO: What is the mechanism of the transmission of chloroplast
through the generations and of their division?<p>

ROBBELEN: That is difficult to establish. We have some electron
microscope pictures of division of chloroplasts in later stages, but
in higher plants this division mostly takes place already in the very
young stages of proplastids, where you don't have many thylakoids but
only one or a few prolamellar bodies, and then division is only by
incision in the matrix area.<p>

BONOTTO: You found 30 chloroplasts per cell about. These multiply by
division, so that earlier they had been about 15?<p>

ROBBELEN: No, probably cell division and chloroplast multiplication
coincides in such a way that after each cell division the old
chloroplast number is restored. There are surely differences in
different cell layers, originating by disturbance of this coordination
in cell and chloroplast division. You find more chloroplasts in the
palisade cells than in the parenchyme layers of the leaf.<p>

BONOTTO: What do you think about the correlation between mitochondria
and plastids in these early stages?<p>

ROBBELEN: I think the theory that chloroplasts and mitochondria may
originate from the same precursor is not valid today.<p>
