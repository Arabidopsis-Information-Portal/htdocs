It has been reported (REDEI 1964) that a gametophyte-factor (new
designation Gf) in linkage group 2 caused abnormal segregation.  Since
the unusual female gametophyte factor fails to transmit through the
megaspores (Probability of 1% transmission if 0.0001) by using
appropriate markers e.g., (Gf + / + py) x (py / py) (py = pyrimidine
requiring) the frequency of the recombinant strand (+,+) in the egg
nuclei can be easily ascertained by the aid of the inherent
selectivity of the conditional lethal system (half tetrad).  Through
the male side all four products of the meiosis can be recovered. The
male transmission of Gf is, however, only ca. 32 percent.  Simple test
cross using Gf carrier as pollen parent does not reveal the genetic
constitution of each strand because Gf does not have visible
phenotype; it merely affects the transmission of the carrier strand.
For a complete analysis an additional progeny test is needed beyond
the test cross generation.  A satisfactory estimate of the
recombination frequency can be obtained, by a simple manipulation:
e.g., in a (py as/ py as) x Gf + / + py) test cross from the number of
pyrimidine requiring individuals, the recombination fraction obtained
in the female was substracted and this was the frequency of the male
transmitted Gf+ py strands was derived.  Only the py+ class of the
test cross was subjected to an additional progeny analysis.  From the
cross-overs only the number of the Gf+ py+ strands was used.  If the
recombination in female and male is identical the outlined procedure
should yield information on linkage intensity in the male identical
with that observed in the female.  The experimental results obtained
by this technique were the following:<p>

The variation among experimental series is quite considerable.
Recombination is unfortunately a highly variable phenomenon in all
organisms.  It is clear, however, that in the male low recombination
frequencies overlapping the values observed in the female occurred
only in the two small test populations. The difference is significant
at the 0,01 percent level.  Sex differential recombination in plants
was rerely reported so far.  In animals crossing over is very rare in
the heterogametic sex; in monoecious plants if any difference exists,
recombination occurs with lower frequency in megasporogenic meiosis
(cf.  RHOADES 1941).  There is no information from Arabidopsis whether
sex differential recombination would take place also in the absence of
Gf.<p>
