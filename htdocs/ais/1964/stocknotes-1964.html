<h2>Genetic Material</h2>

This shall be the place for giving in future issues of Arabidopsis
Information Service lists of gene symbols, mutant descriptions and
genetic stocks available for distribution in different laboratories.
Kindly take notice of the corresponding note of Dr. MULLER,
Gatersleben, on page 38.<p>

Stocks available: For the next number of Arabidopsis Information
Service a describing list of all natural races being propagated in the
original sortiment of Professor F. Laibach, Limburg/Lahn will be
prepared.  On this occasion it might be valuable to include as many
races as possible, that might be picked up at other localities.
Everyone being in the possession of natural races not originating out
of the Laibach sortiment is kindly requested to send to the editor
some seeds and a description of the habitat, morphology and
development of these forms for comparison and enrollment in this
standard sortiment.<p>

Stocks wanted: It has to be announced the request of Dr. L.
Muhlhauser, 706 Schorndorf, Silcherstr. 67, Deutschland for seeds of
an early flowering glabrous Arabidopsis mutant together with the
initial hairy form.  Small samples available may be sent directly or
by the way of the editor.<p>
