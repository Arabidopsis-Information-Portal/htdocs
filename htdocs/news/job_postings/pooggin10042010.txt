We are looking for a PhD student to work on a project 

"Next generation sequencing for studying viruses and RNA silencing-based 
antiviral defense in model and crop plants" 

We shall apply the Illumina deep-sequencing technology and develop 
bioinfomatic tools to study the viral genome, transcriptome and small 
RNA populations in experimentally infected Arabidopsis plants and 
naturally-infected crop plants with the ultimate goal to obtain 
knowledge for designing an effective RNA-based antiviral vaccine. 

Virus-infected crop plants including rice, cassava, blackgram, cotton, 
banana and tomato, collected in fields worldwide, will be investigated 
by deep-sequencing of fractionated nucleic acids in order to (i) 
identify and de novo assemble complete genomes of newly emerging and 
resistance-breaking viruses, viral strains and viral satellites; (ii) 
determine the nucleotide polymorphism in virus populations; (ii) de 
novo assemble the viral transcriptome and (ii) create genome-wide maps 
of virus-derived siRNAs. 

The project is part of a large COST action network with more than 20 
member-countries (http://costfa0806.aua.gr/). 


A successful candidate should have a master/diploma degree in molecular 
biology and a background and/or a strong interest in boinformatics. 


The position is available from the 1st of January 2011; earlier or later 
starting dates will also be considered. 


The working places will be: 

1) Institute of Botany, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland 
2) Fasteris AG, Geneva, Switzerland (www.fasteris.com) 

The PhD project will be co-supervised by PD Dr. Mikhail Pooggin (University 
of Basel) and Dr. Laurent Farinelli (Fasteris AG).
