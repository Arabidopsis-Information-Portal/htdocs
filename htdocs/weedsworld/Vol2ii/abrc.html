        Our 1995 Seed and DNA Stock List has been mailed, and we have
received many orders for the new stocks.  If you did not receive a copy of
this catalog and would like to have one, just send us an email message. 
The information for these new stocks has been added to AIMS, and the stocks
can be ordered through the  <a HREF="http://aims.cps.msu.edu/aims/">Web server  </a>.  Images for 
many of the new seed stocks are available in AIMS, and new images are being 
added to the database on a regular basis. <P>

        Donations of new seed and DNA stocks are always welcome.  This is
an especially good time for seed donations since adequate time exists for
seed bulking and stock characterization before the next catalog is
published.  We are currently preparing to send letters to individuals
possessing published mutant lines which have not previously been donated. <P>

        You have probably heard from past Weeds World issues and
Arabidopsis newsgroup communications that the Creelman-Wing TAM bacterial
artificial chromosome library is currently available and that the P1
library from Mitsui Plant Biotechnology and the CIC YAC library from CNRS
have been received and are being prepared for distribution.  These will be
distributed mainly as filters with individual colonies being sent following
initial probing of the filters.  The complete P1 and CIC library will be
available on a limited basis by special request.  The complete BAC library
is available only from the donors.  Since these libraries are being
replicated and blotted to filters outside the Center (by the originators in
the case of the BAC and commercially for P1 and CIC), the modest cost of
this process will be passed on to the recipients.  One P1 filter will cost
$150-300, and $25 is being charged for the BAC filters.  The price of the
CIC library filters has not yet been determined.  An appropriate charge
will be levied for shipping of the entire CIC and P1 libraries as clones. <P>

        We are beginning to prepare to our renewal submission for continued
funding to the National Science Foundation, as the initial 5-year grant
ends August 31, 1996.  As a part of this submission we will document the
usage of our stocks by the scientific community.  Consequently, we request
that investigators who have published papers utilizing ABRC stocks send
reprints of these to us (at the address below).  Citations would be
acceptable if the reprint cannot be supplied.  Also, it is important that
you let us know at this time what services you would like to see maintained
or upgraded, as well as any new services that you would like us to
implement. <P>

        We just completed our third full year of sending stocks.  From June
1, 1994 to May 15, 1995 1000 seed orders and 1200 DNA orders were filled. A
total of 5,000 DNA stocks and 34,000 seed stocks were shipped. Included in
the DNA total are a number of complete YAC library orders and filter sets. 
We are grateful to all researchers who have ordered stocks and made new
donations.  We are always receptive to suggestions about our stocks,
procedures and services.  Stock orders, donations and other communications
can be sent to the appropriate contacts below.   <P>
