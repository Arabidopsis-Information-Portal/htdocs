INTRODUCTION<p>

One of the causes increasing environmental variation is asynchronous
germination of fresh-harvested seeds. The best results on seed
germination synchronisation of A. thaliana were received by Van der
Veen (1965). According to his data all seeds germinate during 23 days.
This method has some inconveniences. It is necessary to collect pods
at the definite stage of maturity then to keep seeds in the thermostat
(32*degrees*C) during 3 weeks to expose seeds to light etc.<p>

MATERIAL AND METHODS<p>

The method suggested has been worked out as a result of the study of
the influence of many factors on the synchronism of germination.
Fresh-harvested seeds of the races Enkheim (En), Estland(Est),
Dijon(Di) and seeds of the different mutants (304, av, 2075/4 selected
from these races have been used. Stage maturity of the pods has not
been taken into account. Seeds were sown in Petri dishes on
solution-soaked (KNO 3, 0.1 M) filter paper. The number of germinating
seeds was estimated every 12 hrs. from the keeping Petri dishes in the
thermostat (+23..+24*degrees*C, dark).<p>

RESULTS<p>

Seeds size (large or small) and pollination method (artificial or
natural) did not influence the synchronism of germination. Geli laser
light during 1-3 sec. initiated germination, but did not influence the
synchronism of germination. This light 1, 2, and 5 min. inhibited
germination. Duration of stratification (+2..+3*degrees*C during 1,
2,..20 days) had powerful effect on the germination. Optimal duration
of stratification was not equal for all genotypes. Variable
temperatures (23 hrs. +2..+3*degrees*C, 1 hr +22..23*degreesC during
2, 4, 6 days; 24 hrs. -4..-3*degrees*C, 24 hrs.+2..+3*degrees*C during
6, 10, 25 days etc.) had different effect on the synchronism of
germination. 98-99% of mutant seeds germinated during 24 hrs in some
experiments. However, nongerminated seeds made up from 1 to 10% in all
above mentioned experiments. The method proposed (+23..24*degrees*C 1
day, dark) ensures germination of all seeds during 36 hours (Table 1).<p>

different methods.<p>

Temperature influence of +23..+24*degrees*C during 1 day before
stratification is, probably, the most important part of the method.
This procedure, performed before treating the seeds both according to
van der Veen's method and to our (Petrov et al., 1976) increases
germination and considerably improves it synchronism. As compared with
all other variants the method suggested conditioned the least
variations of the germination average period (x) and variability (s 2)
both inside and between the genotypes which had been studied.<p>
