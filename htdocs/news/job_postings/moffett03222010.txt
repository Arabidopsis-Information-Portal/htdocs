MSc or PhD student position

Graduate student positions are available in the Moffett lab in the
Department of Biology at the University of Sherbrooke. Research projects
will involve the study of plant disease resistance mechanisms with an
emphasis on anti-viral defence responses. Projects will focus on molecular
mechanisms of the receptor-like proteins that recognize pathogens and their
interplay with RNAi-related mechanisms in anti-viral defences as well as
underlying mechanisms of gene regulation. Students will employ a variety of
genetic, biochemical and cell biology techniques. Enrolment will be
considered at either the masters or PhD level for a start date spring or
fall 2010 with standard graduate stipends.

Applicants should send a cover letter outlining their career and research
goals, a CV, and unofficial transcript, and the contact information for two
references to Dr. Peter Moffett: peter.moffett@usherbrooke.ca
