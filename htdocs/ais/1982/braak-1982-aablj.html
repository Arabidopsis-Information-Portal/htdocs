After the isolation of reverse mutants of the nitrate
reductase-deficient mutant B25 (Braaksma and Feenstra, 1975, 1979,
1982; Feenstra and Braaksma, 1976) we were interested whether also
revertants of another nitrate reductase-deficient mutant, B73, could
be isolated. Reverse mutants of B25 could be isolated as green plants
on a nitrate medium since the mutant B25 forms small yellow plants on
this medium. Among ca. 30.000 M 1 plants (after EMS-treatment of the
seeds) no green seedlings could be found.<p>

Testing 1000 M 2 progenies of B25, 7 independently arisen revertants
were isolated, resulting in a reversion frequency as high as 1.2 x
10E-3. Since B73 also gives yellowish plants on the nitrate medium,
revertants can likewise be isolated as green plants. After
EMS-treatment of B73 seeds (40 mM, during 4 hrs., preimbibed seeds) M
2 seeds from 6 M 1 plants were usually harvested together and sown as
one progeny. After screening for green plants on nitrate medium
surprisingly ca. 90% of the 200 progenies shown contained one or more
green plants. This indicates an extemely high reversion frequency.
Reversions did only occur after mutagenic treatment with B73, without
such treatment B73 has never given a revertant.<p>

The revertants of B73 grew clearly better on the nitrate medium than
B73 itself but worse than wild type. Some relatively well growing
plants were crossed with B73 and selfed. Most seeds germinated poorly
or not at all, however, 4 different crosses evertant x B73 could be
tested and yielded F1's exhibiting the phenotype of &#158;73; the
revertant character in these cases thus is recessive. Normal mutatio
ncan not explain tlhe high fequency of reversions; what the mechanism
which gies these rsults might be is not clear.<p>
