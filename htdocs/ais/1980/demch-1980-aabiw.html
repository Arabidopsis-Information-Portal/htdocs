It has been shown elsewhere (Demchenko et al., 1976) that the genome
of the plant cell switched on to dedifferentiated growth displays
stable and transmits the original penetrance and level of
expressiveness for five morphological markers examined to the
regenerants. However, it remained unclear whether the gene activity in
the cells during callus growth was affected. Direct analysis of gene
activity involving control over its products, i.e., the synthesis of
individual informing DNA molecules, is too complicated. An
electrophoretic study of multiple molecular species of enzymes has
been used more extensively as a method of gene testing (Anonym., 1977;
VITT, G.S.: Schwartz, D., 1960). Qualitatively different genes
determining enzymes and their activity are visualized by zymograms.<p>

The subject of this work is a comparative study of the genome
condition by the isozymes in actively growing tissues and under
natural degradation, and also of the zymograms of tissues of native
differentiated plants and the same tissues switched on to
dedifferentiated growth on a cultural medium. To this end oxidative
enzymes playing a key role in the metabolism, the processes of growth,
differentiation and dedifferentiation, and degradation, i.e.,
peroxidase (PO), polyphenol-oxidase (PPO) and malatdehydrogenase (MDG)
were under investigation. The subject of investigation was the same as
under Demchenko et al. (1976), namely genetic plant model Arabidopsis
thaliana (L.) Heynh., race Enkheim and a mutant line gl'an carrying
two morphological markers: gl'-mutation in the third chromosome
leading to complete absence of pubescence on the leaves and
an-mutation in the first chromosome responsible for narrow elongated
leaves with serated edges.<p>

Plants were grown under similar standard conditions of a long (20 hrs)
day, in a tube culture, on a sterile agar medium. A triple comparison
between the in vivo and in vitro levels, the new and degrading
tissues, and tissus of different genotypes, was made for each of the
three enzymes.<p>

As a differentiated tissue, we used leaves at a rosette stage, in the
period of active growth and function and at a maturation phase at
which the rosette leaves grew yellow and began to die. As a
dedifferentiated tissue, callus grown from the same leaves at a
rosette phase from the plants grown in a sterile tube culture was
used. Callus was grown on the nutritional medium of Murashige and
Skoog containing microelements, vitamins, hormones (Murashige, T. et
al. 1962). It was investigated at the time of active growth (increase
of biomass) and at the degradation phase, i.e., cessation of growth
and beginning of browning of individual cells. Protein was extracted
from acetone preparations of leaf and callus. Electrophoresis of
catalytically active proteins was performed according to the method of
Davis (1964). PO and PPO enzymes were developed using benzidine and
pyrocatechol as substrates for peroxidase and polyphenoloxidase,
respectively. Peroxidase and malatdehydrogenase activity in the callus
was 5.6 times that in the leaves, which was taken into account while
protein was spread on the electrophoretic tube. Protein extracted from
the leaves was concentrated through the ultramembrane placed into
Sephadex G-100. Electrophoretic patterns of the three enzymes studied
are represented diagrammatically in the Figure 1.<p>

The anode isoperoxidase complex examined had a low activity and was
represented for the most part by isoperoxidases of low mobility. In
the degrading leaves and callus anode isoperoxidases of medium
relative electrophoretic mobility (REM) were present. A majority of
anode isoperoxidases was displayed as diffuse bands. A somewhat higher
activity was shown by molecular species with REM 0.08 in mature and
0.15 in degrading leaves; 0.24 in actively growing and 0.09, 0.31 in
degrading callus. It should be noted that a low mobility anode complex
with REM 0.08-0.1 is characteristic of Arabidopsis tissues, as shown
in the work of Gleba et al., 1978, in which another albina mutant was
under investigation.<p>

While examining the diagrammatic representation of the PPO isoenzyme
activity, our attention is first of all attracted by the markedly
higher hetrogeneity of the callus enzyme, which may be due to the
involvement of PPO catalyzing oxidation of different phenols in the
processes of cell growth and division in vitro. Upon leaf degradation
one of the two isozyme components was lost, upon callus degradation
full isoenzyme spectrum persisted.<p>

Of the oxidative enzymes studied the most stable spectrum was that of
the MDG molecular species. Leaf tissue and callus at an active growth
phase and initial degradation stage had four clearcut isoforms: two of
low mobility and lower activity and two of a very high activity with
the medium REM. The highest REM isoenzyme showed a distinct tendency
to increase the mobility under dedifferentiated growth and
degradation. We assumed the REM difference of 0.02 units to be the
experimental error; the higher difference should be considered to be
the isoform mobility difference.<p>

The analysis of the electrophoretic patterns has revealed tissue
similarity visualized by the zymograms obtained for all compared
variants, i.e., all the bands of the in vivo variant were present in
the callus variant, the number of the isozyme components of actively
metabolizing and degrading tissues was most often the same or differed
by 1 unit, as in PPO; both genotypes examined were similar for the
enzymes of oxidative metabolism. Upon degradation and
dedifferentiation there was a general tendency of increase of the
working gene activity visualized as broader bands and incorporation of
new genes expressed as the appearance of additional minor bands. Full
isozyme identity of the two Arabidopsis lines, native race Enkheim and
mutant line gl'an, suggests that the morphological genes are not
connected with the examined biochemical charactristics, i.e., they do
not cause any changes in the oxidative enzyme complex.<p>
