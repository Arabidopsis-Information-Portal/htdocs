Remarkable similarity in quantum requirement of the blue (B) and far
red (FR) wave length to first floral induction was firstly established
in Arabidopsis thaliana by Brown and Klein (1971). They postulated
that this photomorphogenesis probably resulted from continuous
excitation of a stable, FR-absorbing phytochrome (Pfr) by direct
absorption or transfer of energy from an accessory B-absorbing
photoreceptor (Pb). The effects were obtained under monochromatic B
(485 nm) or FR 9730 nm) light (100 microW cm-2) for 20 hours and 4
hours white (W) light per period as well as under continuous high
intensity of the monochromatic light (200-300 microW cm-2) for 22
days. Furthermore Pumpianskaya and Velikanov (1976) concluded from
calculation s by Borthwick and Hendrick's zero-method that in the same
long-day plant, (LDP) A. thaliana ecotype Estland, during the first 8
hours of the 16 hours dark period the Pfr-levels were high, and thus
"reproduction" (flowering) increased after FR treatment.<p>

These data are also in good agreement with recent observation in
variant genotypes of Arabidopsis (Kranz, 1979, 1980) and in other
LD-plant species (Vince-Prue, 1975) showing that floral development is
optimal if sufficient phytochrome (Pfr) is transformed by FR-light
during the critical timing after the first 4 hours dark of short day
(SD) periods. However, Fellenberg (1976) could hardly explain these
data in his review article "soleby the simple hypothesis of
photoreversion of phytochrome promoting appropriate gene activations
or inactivations which are necessary for the production of a floral
stimulus". Nevertheless, Frolich and Nagl (1979) have recently
presented experimetnal evidence for amplification of repetitive DNA
sequences during flower induction of Phaseolus coccineus, and
Nakashima (1973) was able to show that in Lemna gibba phytochrome
works via thymidine metabolism. Since 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrDu), an
analogue of thymidine, which is incorporated during DNA synthesis of
Arabidopsis (Redei et al., 1974) promotes flowering strongly under
noninductive light/dark periods as well as P fr/P tot-conditions
(Kranz, 1979, 1980), consequently, it was interesting to study the
photosensitized flowering through BrDU under inductive treatment of
B-, and FR-light in certain quantitative LD-genotypes of A. thaliana.<p>

On the whole the design of our experiments (material, aseptic culture,
BrDU- and light treatments) were equal to those previously described
(Kranz, 1979) with few exceptions mentioned in the following.
Precedingly, the developmental phase specificity of the BrDU-effect
upon flowering was studied in the wild ecotype Pr-O and the pigment
deficient mutant line ch2. Table 1a ahows that under short-day
conditions (SD, 10L/14D hrs.) the treatment of BrDU beginning from the
second week after sowing yielded highest frequency of flowering plants
after 50 SD cycles plus interfering R light (20 min) in Pr-O whereas
maximum floral induction was from the fourth week in ch2. This phase
specificity of BrDU was not obtained when the R-light followed
immediately the short days (Figue 1).<p>

Table 1a, b: The effect of weekly timed (a) and continuous BrDU
treatments (0.5 x 10E-5M) with interfering blue-(B), red-(R), and far
red-(FR) light (b) after 4 hours darkness of the long night of short
day periods on the floral induction (1st flower open 50 days after
seeding) in the wild ecotype Pr-O and the pigment defective mutant ch2
of Arabidopsis thaliana.<p>

Figure 1: No phase specificity of the BrDU-effect upon flowering under
50 SD cycles (10L/14D hrs.) plus 20 min. red light (R 10) immediately
following the day in two genotypes (Pr-O above, ch2 below) of A.
thaliana. BrDU-free control (C.H2O) on the left side; two test tubes
per treatment of BrDU beginning weekly from second (B 2.) to sixth (B
6.) week.<p>

Since DNA-pyrimidines are photosensitive compounds and the thymidine
analogue BrDU has an absorption in UV (*lambda* max = 283 +/- 37 nm), we
then studied the interaction of interfering B-, R/FR-light (45 min.)
after 4 hrs dark of the long SD night (Table 1b). The aseptic agar
medium contained BrDU (0.5 x 10E-5M) and/or thymidine (10E-3M) and
thus they were continuously effective. As expected 50 days after
seeding flowering was low (Pr-O) or zero (ch2) in the BrDU-free
control and also through nullifieing the BrDU effect by thymidine.
Significant increase of floral induction was obtained by interfering
Fr- or B-light in both genotypes, though in the mutant ch2 this effect
was maximum only through treatments of FR light. Furthrmore the
genotypes may respond differently to the first or second period of
interfering light.<p>

All in all for the time being our experimental results argue for close
interactions between the gene expression via thymidine metabolism, the
photosensitizer, rsp. wavelength transformer BrDU, and the B-, rsp.
R/FR-light receptors mediating the floral induction on shoot meristem
cells of Arabidopsis. Our experimental system may provide an
appropriate model of mimicking the role of cryptochrome (Pb) and/or
phytochrome (Pfr) promoting the gene repressions which impede the
transcription of putative flowering inhibitor (Redei et al., 1974) in
A. thaliana.<p>
