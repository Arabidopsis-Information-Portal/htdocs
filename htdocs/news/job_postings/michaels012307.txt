A RESEARCH ASSOCIATE position is available in the Michaels lab 
(http://www.bio.indiana.edu/~michaelslab/index.html and 
http://www.bio.indiana.edu/facultyresearch/faculty/Michaels.html) to study the 
molecular basis of flowering-time regulation in Arabidopsis. Responsibilities 
will include the isolation and characterization of mutants, generation of 
transgenic plants, and the use of standard molecular and biochemical techniques 
(e.g. PCR, RNA analysis, sequencing, cloning). In addition to experimental work, 
the technician will be responsible for routine lab maintenance and assisting 
graduate students/postdocs. Experience with plants is helpful, but not required. 
Interested parties should send a cover letter outlining interests, complete CV, 
and contact information for two individuals willing to supply letters of 
recommendation via email to michaels@indiana.edu.
