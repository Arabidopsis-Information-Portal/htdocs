*  This protocol allows the efficient and simple preparation of yeast 
chromosomes.  These are subsequently subjected to pulsed field gel 
electrophoresis for separation.  Yeast artificial chromosomes are clearly 
visible on ethidium bromide stained gels and their size can be 
determined.

1.  SOLUTION & MEDIUM
  (i) TE
10mM Tris - HCl
1mM EDTA
pH 8.0

  (ii) YEPD-MEDIUM (l-1)
10 g  Bacto-yeast extract
20 g Bacto-peptone
20 g Glucose
100 mg adenine
 *  Agar medium is solidified with 2% Bacto-agar.

2.  PROCEDURE
  (i) Grow yeast cells are o/n. at 30oC in 10 ml liquid YEPD medium 
(inoculated from YEPD agar plates).
  (ii) Harvest cells by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min.
  (iii) Wash cells with 1 ml 1M Sorbitol, spin down in microcentrifuge tube.  
Remove supernatant.  The packed cell volume should be ca. 50 ul.  If 
necessary, reduce to this volume of cells.
  (iv) Freeze cells in liquid N2.
  (v) Thaw frozen cells at 65oC.
  (vi) Repeat freezing and thawing 2x.
  (vii) Add 60 ul 1% InCert agarose (F.M.C.) made up in 1M Sorbitol, at 
50oC, mix gently and pipette into 100 ul gel plug moulds, place on ice to 
set.
  (viii) Place the blocks into 1 ml of 0.5 mgml-1 Proteinase K in 100mM 
EDTA pH 8, 1% Sarkosyl and incubate at 50oC for at least 1 - 4 h.
  (ix) Exchange buffer for 1 ml of fresh 0.5mgml-1 Proteinase K  in 
100mM EDTA pH 8, 1 % Sarkosyl and incubate o/n at 50oC.
  (x) Wash blocks 2 -3x 15 - 30 min with 1 ml of TE, 1 x 15 - 30 min with 0.5 
x TBE, exchange 0.5 x TBE solution and store in TBE.  In all cases mix
