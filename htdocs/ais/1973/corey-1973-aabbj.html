<h2> Diallel crosses among races of Arabidopsis thaliana</h2><p>

Six races of Arabidopsis from Europe, Asia, and Africa and one race
collected in North Carolina served as parents in a diallel analysis.
The races and all possible F1 hybrids, including reciprocals, were
evaluated in a growth chamber with continuous light of 1600 ft.-c. at
25*degrees*C.  Individual seeds were sown in test tubes on an aseptic
mineral agar. Two levels of nutrients were used; one, the standard for
Arabidopsis culture and the other, 1/12 standard level.<p>

Three characters evaluated were germination time, length of the
primary root 12 days after seeding, and mass green weight of the
entire plant 18 days after seeding.  Significant differences were
obtained among races and among hybrids within each nutrient level and
combined over nutrient levels. The hybrids outperformed the parents
for all races except the race from Tsu Islands, in which case the
performance of the Tsu Islands race surpassed the hybrids.<p>

From the diallel analysis of the hybrids, variance components for
general combining ability, specific combining ability and specific
reciprocal differences were not significant.  However, a large
component of variance existed for average maternal effects, suggesting
that a large portion of the variance among genotypes was due to
maternal seed effects or to the cytoplasm.<p>
