Team Leader or Unit Leader for the Dormancy and Adaptation Research 
Team of the Growth Regulation Research Group at RIKEN Plant Science 
Center, Yokohama Institute 
 
 
[Research Department] 
Dormancy and Adaptation Research Team, Growth Regulation Research Group 
Center Director: Dr. Kazuo Shinozaki 
Group Director: Dr. Yuji Kamiya 
 
[Profile of the Laboratory] 
Plant growth and development is strongly regulated by endogenous low 
molecular weight signaling compounds (plant hormones). In order to 
improve qualitative and quantitative production of plants, this team 
studies the molecular mechanism of dormancy and the adaptive response 
of plants to various environmental conditions. By using genetic, 
genomic and biochemical approaches, we will investigate the 
regulation of these processes by abscisic acid (ABA) and other 
adaptation related hormones.
