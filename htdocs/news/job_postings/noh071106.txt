POSTDOCTORAL POSITIONS
 
Two postdoctoral positions are immediately available in the laboratory of
Dr. Yoo-Sun Noh, the Global Research Laboratory for Flowering, in the
Department of Biological Sciences at Seoul National University, Seoul,
Korea.
 
These positions are supported by the large international collaborative
Global Research Laboratory Program that allows intensive collaborations and
researcher exchanges between Seoul National University and the University of
Wisconsin-Madison (Laboratory of Dr. Richard Amasino).
 
The positions are to study the floral regulatory signaling and the
chromatin-mediated regulation of plant development. Research tools like
forward and reverse genetic analyses of Arabidopsis mutants, gene expression
analyses, transient gene expressions in protoplasts, microarray studies,
chromatin immunoprecipitations, isolation and component characterization of
polyprotein complexes will be used. 
 
Persons with experiences in genetic studies or protein biochemistry are
highly encouraged to apply. Researchers with experiences in systems other
than plants are also encouraged to apply.
 
Seoul National University is a leading university in Korea and provides a
world-class environment for the study of plant development due to a diverse
and highly interactive community of plant developmental biologists and
excellent facilities.
 
To apply, please send CV and contact information for three references via
e-mail to ysnoh@snu.ac.kr.
