<p>


This page provides instructions on how to read current messages,
search for old messages, send messages and subscribe by e-mail, to
arab-gen, the electronic Arabidopsis newsgroup
[bionet.genome.arabidopsis]. It is based upon a message originally
sent to the newsgroup by the Gasser lab, who generously moderate the
newsgroup to screen out undesirable messages.

If you have access to a Web browser, you can read and
post to the newsgroup by using the BIOSCI WWW web site:<p>

http://www.bio.net/hypermail/ARABIDOPSIS/</a>

<p>

The newsgroup is supported by BIOSCI. BIOSCI is a set of electronic
communication fora - the bionet USENET newsgroups and parallel e-mail
lists - used by biological scientists worldwide. No fees are charged for
the service. The U.S. BIOSCI site is supported by advertising raised
through this Web site. The U.K. BIOSCI node is supported by the Daresbury
Laboratory. So, by using this web site, you may ensure a long life to this
newsgroup and other useful BIOSCI newsgroups found at the
http://www.bio.net web site. The WWW Interface to the BIOSCI/bionet newsgroup
also includes a complete <b>searchable archive</b> of all previously posted
messages. <b>The archive may also be searched from 
<a href=/AT-arabgen.html>AtDB</a>.
</b>
<p>

If you do not have access to a Web browser, you can subscribe to the
Listserv mailing list and receive the posted messages automatically. For
the BIOSCI mailing lists, two different types of E-mail addresses are
used for two different purposes. One is for subscribing and unsuscribing to
the newsgroup mailing list and the other one is for posting to that
newsgroup.

<p>

For those in the <b>Americas</b> and <b>Pacific Rim</b>, send the commands:<p>

<b><dd>subscribe arab-gen<br></b>
<dd>or
<b><dd>unsubscribe arab-gen <br></b>
<p>
to the address <b>biosci-server@net.bio.net</b>.  The command should be
in the body of the message. The Subject: line should be left blank.

<p>
<br>

For <b>European, African</b>, and <b>Central Asian</b> users, who want to
subscribe to or unsubscribe from the mailing list, the commands are,
respectively:<p>

<b><dd>sub bionet-news.bionet.genome.arabidopsis<br></b>
<dd>or <br>
<b><dd>unsub bionet-news.bionet.genome.arabidopsis<br></b><p>

sent to the address <b>mxt@dl.ac.uk</b><br>

The command should be in the body of the message. The Subject: line should be left blank. 

<p>



At both sites the user's address must match the one on the list
exactly or the process will fail.  For human assistance contact
biosci-help@net.bio.net in the Americas and Pacific Rim or
biosci@daresbury.ac.uk for Europe, Africa, and Central Asia.

<p>
Once you are on the mailing list, <b>messages to be posted</b> should be sent to
the following addresses:<br>

<p>
For those in the <b>Americas</b> and <b>Pacific Rim</b>:<br>
<dd>arab-gen@net.bio.net

<p>
For <b>European, African</b>, and <b>Central Asian</b> users:<br>
<dd>arab-gen@dl.ac.uk</b>
