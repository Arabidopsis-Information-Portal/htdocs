	Trisomics in Arabidopsis (Columbia wild type) were first described by L. M. STEINITZ-SEARS (1963).  They were unnamed and are termed here according to their phenotype:  R (round leafed), Y (yellow or light), Nc (narrow cut leaf), and Ns (narrow serrated) respectively.  In the race En-2 ROBBELEN and KRIBBEN (1966) selected four trisomics which were numbered I-IV.  McKELVIE (private communication) also found some trisomics in his stocks.<p>

	Trisomics were crossed to homozygous mutant marker lines representing the six linkage groups established by G. P. REDEI (REDEI and HIRONO; cf. also Arabidopsis Research, Gottingen, p. 210) and kindly provided by him. Some additional material was used in Gottingen provided by A. D. McKELVIE.  F2 segregations from trisomic F1 plants were observed and some of the same markers were used at both institutions. The data obtained independently at the two laboratories are presented here in two tables from which some conclusions may be drawn about the location of the linkage groups and the correspondence of the trisomic lines. Detailed reports will follow.<p>

	From the phenotypic appearance jof the trisomic as well as from the genetic data it can be stated that:<p>

	R is the same as III and carries REDEI's linkage group 2.<p>

	Y is the same as I and carries REDEI's linkage group 3, which seems to be the same as McKELVIE's linkage group 2<p>

	The two narrow leafed trisomics (Nc and Ns), regarded as two different types, are the same and identical with IV; it carries linkage group 5 of REDEI and 3 of McKELVIE.<p>

	Trisomic II differs from &#148;, Y, and N and carries REDEI's linkage group 4.<p>

	The fifth primary trisomic (STEINITZ-SEARS, 1963) was lost because of its weak nature and poor transmission.  Efforts are being made to recover this type.<p>
