In an extensive series of papers starting in 1960 (JAIN and ALLARD,
1960), a group of workers of University of California, Davis, have
subjected to a penetrating analysis not only the theoretical
principles governing the population structure of predominantly
self-pollinating plant species but also the statics and dynamics of
artificial and natural populations of those species as, f.i., Hordeum
vulgare, Triticum aestivum, Phaseolus lunatus, Avena fatua, Festuca
microstachys, and others.  The most interesting conclusion was that
the empirical genotypic frequencies corresoponded to a common effect
of a low proportion of random cross-fertilization and of definite
selection pressures favouring heterozygotes.  Some natural populations
were found to be in equilibrium at high frequencies of heterozygotes
and thus in the condition of balanced polymorphism.  In this way, it
was possible to demonstrate that the genetic evolutional potential of
predominantly self-pollinating plant species compared with the
cross-fertilizing ones is controlled by qualitatively same mechanisms.<p>

Three hypotheses are connected with this model: (1) the low proportion
of random cross-fertilization; (2) the selection pressures against
homozygotes; (3) the equilibrium condition at H>O in some natural
populations.<p>

In our experiments with more than 200 samples of natural populations
of Arabidopsis from MORAVIA carried out since 1963 it was shown that
there exists in the genetic determination of the developmental rate
not only a large geographical variability among populations but also a
high degree of variability both between and within lines derived of
them. The geographical variability is clinal the late flowering
genotypes being bound to the lowland with relatively high
temperatures.  On these localities, selection pressures exist against
early flowering genotypes, the latter being, on the contrary, bound to
the highland localities with lower temperatures.  An extensive
transitional zone of "mixed" populations appears in this
grographical-climatical gradient. The 'mixed" populations show an
extemely high degree of variability in the flowering time both between
and within lines (CETL, DOBROVOLNA, and EFFERMTOVA, 1969).  The
genetic character of this variability can be demonstrated by high
values of coefficients of heritability (DOBROVOLNA, 1969).  Alleles
for later flowering are mostly dominant over those for early flowering
(EFFMERTOVA and CETL, 1968). By means of comparison with homozygous
lines it can be shown that often up to 70 percent lines are
segregating for the flowering time and thus a very high proportion of
heterozygotes is suggested (DOBROVOLNA, 1967).<p>

Unfortunately, the number of loci and alleles responsible for the
differences in the flowering time is unknown (KARLOVSKA, 1974), and
more simple model situations must be chosen to analyze the population
structure of Arabidopsis.<p>

If two recessive mutants were sown densely (9 cm2 per plant) in
alternating rows, and complementing standard individuals were counted
in the following generation, the proportion of cross-fertilization was
found to be 1.96 +/- 1.24 percent.  Under conditions favouring
cross-fertilization (artificial motion of flowering plants), the
proportion of random crossing rose to 4.24 +/- 3.34 percent. Thus, in
consent with previous studies, Arabidopsis thaliana goes with other
self-fertiliziang plant species with a low frequency of spontaneous
random crossing.<p>

In the experiments carried out to determine the possible selection
advantage of heterozygotes, recessive chlorophyll mutations lethal in
the seedling stage were used.  Eight artificial populations carrying
different mutant alleles each were started with seeds harvested from
heterozygotes, ch+ch, so that the initial frequency of heterozygotes
was Ho=1.  The embryo test (MULLER, 1963) made possible to distinguish
between dominant homozygotes and heterozygotes and to determine the
frequencies of both surviving genotypes.  In each following
generation, a random sample of seeds of previous generation was sown.<p>

Frequencies of heterozygotes expected in each successive generation
under absence of any selection were compared with those actually
observed. At the same time, relative viabilities (v1) and adaptive
values (w1) = v1 . f1) were estimated in the dominant homozygote
ch+ch+ when all these values in the heterozygote were put equal 1.
Table 1 shows that in seven of eight populations studied, selection
favouring heterozygotes was present.  Only in the population carrying
the ch 42 allele selection againt the homozygote ch+ch+ was not
proved.  In some populations (f.i., with ch 2411), the v1 and w2
values were stable while in other (f.i., with ch 4062), they
diminished from generation to generation. As the frequency of
heterozygotes decreased with each following generation this downward
tendency of v1 and w1 values might be explained by means of the
frequency-dependent selection (JAIN and JAIN, 1970).<p>

H4, with relative viabilities, v1 and adaptive values w1, of dominant
homozygotes ch+ch+.<p>

It is yet difficult to predict whether balanced polymorphism might
arise in some populations.  It is known (CTL, 1974) that w1 values
lower than 0.5 are necessary to attain equilibrium at H>O and to avoid
fixation of the ch+ allele.  Our data suggest that this possibility is
not excluded in the case of populations with ch 2040, ch 4062, ch
1467, and X 28-19.<p>

A numerous group exists among "mixed" populations whose frequency of
early homozygous recessive genotypes amounts from few tenths percent
to about 20 percent.  The members of this group occupy a narrow range
of localities on the outmost S-E extremities of the mountains called
CESKOMORAVSKA VRCHOVINA.  They are scarcely affected by anthropic
influences, and complete selection against early genotypes take place
in them.  One of these populations, HV-3, was found to be in
equilibrium (EFFMERTOVA and CETL, 1968).  As the frequency of
heterozygotes was also known it was easy, assuming complete
self-fertilization, to estimate the adaptive value of the dominant
homozygote, w1=0.46.  Under the assumption that also other members of
this group are in equilibrium, we attempted to determine the w1 values
in them, using several ways of estimation. Similar values were found.
But with the increasing proportion of early genotypes the estimated w1
values decreased and rapidly came to zero just at 25p.c. early
genotypes, i.e., at the upper limit of this group. The estimated
values for this entire group[ are thus always lower than 0.5.  In this
way, the deciding condition is fulfilled to attain equilibrium at H>O
and pass to the condition of balanced polymorphism.  As the estimated
w1 values appraoch rather 0.5 than 0, the equilibrium is attained very
slowly and thus these populations must be of long standing.<p>

Our results confirm that Arabidopsis thaliana proved competent to be
used in testing all three above hypotheses.<p>
