Our attempts to get good preparations of the mature pollen of
Arabidopsis by means of the known methods (staining by Ehrlich's
haematoxylin, Feulgen's reagent, toluidine blue) did not give the
satisfactory results. The method by means of which it is possible to
obtain high quality of preparations is decscribed below.<p>

The sequence of manipulations necessary can be divided into the
following steps:<p>

1. A droplet of proteihn of hen's egg is spotted on the slide, and
after that it is spread to a l cm 2 patch.<p>

2. A swab of pollen is taken on the surface of the spotted protein
slide. This operation made by a separate anther or by a flower without
a perianth.<p>

3. The protein is dried up; the swab of pollen is immediately fixed in
the Carnoy holder (ethanol, chloroform, acetic acid; 6:3:1). The
duration of fixation is 1-30 min.<p>

4. After the fixation the preparations must be properly washed in 2-3
changes of 70% ethanol and then in distilled water.<p>

5. The preparations are placed into 50% hydrochloric acid for 5, 10,
20 min. Thereafter they are washed two times in distilled water.<p>

6. The preparations should be stained in azur-eosin according to
Giemsa-Romanovsky's method during 5, 10, 20 min.<p>

7. After staining the preparations have to be washed two times by
distilled water, then by 2 changes of 96% ethanol, after that it is
passed two times through butanol and finally two times through xylol.
&#160;These steps should be done rapidly.<p>

8. After treatment to xylol the preparations should be enclosed in
Canadian balsam.<p>

Figure 1 A-C: The mature pollen grains of Arabidopsis thaliana (race
Enkheim)<p>

The cytoplasm of the mature pollen grain is coloured in red, but
generative nuclei are coloured in dark-violet. In the latter the round
chromocenters can be seen, the maximum of them being 5 per nucleus
(Figure C). In a small quantity of pollen grains you can also observe
vegetative nuclei coloured in pale-violet. But it is rather difficult
to get a photomicrograph of them.<p>
