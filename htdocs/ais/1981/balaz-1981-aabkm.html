At the Second International Symposium on Arabidopsis Research held at
Frankfurt am Main (Germany) from 13 to 15 September 1976, Professor
Redei in his opening lecture drew attention to Cauliflower mosaic
virus (CaMV) as a potential vehicle to be used in information transfer
in Arabidopsis (Redei, 1976), a plant species from which true
auxotrophs have been isolated (Langridge, 1955; Redei, 960; Feenstra,
1964). In the last few years work with Cauliflower mosaic virus and
with successful cloning with this virus (Szeto et al., 1977; Meagher
et al., 1977; Howell et al., 1980; Hohn et al., 1980; Lebeurier et
al., 1980) has lent weight to the possibility that this virus will be
a good vector for molecular gene transfer in higher plants. Up to now,
however, no experimental data existed as to whether CaMV is able to
infect Arabidopsis plants. Previous studies of the host range of CaMV
have shown infection to occur with 64 species of the Cruciferae
family, but Arabidopsis was not found as a natural host of CaMV, nor
was it tested as an artificial host (Schmelzer et al., 1977; Horvath
et al., 1980).<p>

Using two different strains of CaMV, Cabb-S (Strasbourg isolate) and
D/H (Budapest isolate), we inoculate five different types of
Arabidopsis thaliana stock plants, listed in Table 1, and scored for
symptom severity. Using purified CaMV at a concentration of 10 micro
g/ml we inoculated 30 plants from each population six weeks after
planting. The infected leaves showed small yellow spots 7-9 days after
inoculation, the plants became slightly stunted and the leaves on the
flowering stem showed typical mosaic symptoms and slight deformations.
The flowers became distorted and reduced in number, while their seed
production decreased markedly. The systemic symptoms developed two
weeks after inoculation (Figure 1). From the infected plants we were
able to recover infective CaMV particles which were tested in back
inoculation and visualized by electron microscopy (Figure 2). At early
stages of infection several small inclusion bodies were often
vacuolate, and sometimes were found closely appressed to the nuclei
connected to it with membrane channel. Both strains induced typcial
inclusion bodies in the systematically infected leaves but not in the
inoculated ones. The symptoms exhibited by all the Arabidopsis
populations, kept under identical conditions in a growth chamber were
similar with some differences in severity ranging from mild to
necrotic symptoms.<p>

Experiments are now in progress to test the infectivity of clones CaMV
DNA. If cloned DNA proves to be infectious, we shall attempt to use it
as a vector to introduce genes into auxotrophic mutants of
Arabidopsis.<p>

Thanks are due to Dr. F. Braaksma and Dr. A.R. Kranz for the seed
samples, and to Dr. J. Horvath for providing us with the D/H isolate
of CaMV.<p>
