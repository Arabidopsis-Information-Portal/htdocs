In an earlier report JEFFREY (1966) reported significant stimulation
of flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana after incorporation of Sr90 and
Cs 137. The stimulation was considered as a radiation effect since it
was also induced by acute exposure of dry seeds to gamma rays.<p>

In a preliminary experiment involving acute gamma irradiation of
vegetative stages it has been found that not only flowering is
stimulated but it seems to be of a higher magnitude than with dry seed
irradiation.  Seeds were planted in test tubes on VELEMINSKYs medium
and grown under constant illumination of 40 W cool white fluorescent
lamps at 25+ 1*degree*C.  The planted seeds were given a 4 day cold
treatment at 4*degrees*C before transferring to the growth room.  A
dose of 1000 rads from a Ca 137 gamma beam was used and the material
was irradiated at the same time on different days of growth: (1) Dry
seed irradiation on agar medium, (2) seeds irradiated on '0' day of
growth, i.e., after the cold treatment, (3) young seedlings irradiated
on the 4th day of growth, (4) seedlings irradiated on the 7th day of
growth, (5) seedlings irradiated on the 9th day of growth. The growth
and flowering of the treated plants was compared with that of controls
and is presented in Figure 1.<p>

There appears to be a pronounced stimulation in flowering after
radiation exposure. Furthermore, the stimulation in flowering is
apparently greater when seedlings are irradiated as compared to dry
seed irradiation.  In this experiment the most effective treatment was
an irradiation of 4 day old seedlings. The total time required for
100% flowering in this treatment (3 days) also appears to be very
short.  This preliminary experiment is being repeated at present. But
positive radiostimulation of flowering seems to be of rather general
occurrence in A. thaliana.<p>
