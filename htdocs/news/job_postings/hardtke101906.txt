A postdoctoral position is available starting January 2007 in the lab of
Christian Hardtke at the Dept. of Plant Molecular Biology, University
of Lausanne, Switzerland.

The candidate is expected to build on recent progress in our lab to  characterize the role of 
Arabidopsis BRX-like genes in hormone  signaling in shoot development, using genetic, biochemical and 
cell  biological techniques (see Mouchel et al., 2006, Nature Vol. 443, p.  458, and Mouchel et al., 2004, Genes & Dev. Vol. 18, p. 700).

Strongly motivated candidates with a demonstrated expertise in molecular
techniques are encouraged to apply. Because funding for this
position is secured for one year only, the successful candidate is  expected to apply
for eligible fellowships.

Please forward applications including a curriculum vitae and contact  information for two senior scientist referees 
by e-mail to  christian.hardtke@unil.ch.
