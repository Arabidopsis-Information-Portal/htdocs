INTRODUCTION<p>

Information on linkage in Arabidopsis is still scanty. Parts of
chromosomes on which a number of genes have been arranged linearly are
known of chromosome 1 (Feenstra, 1978), chromosome 2 (Redei and
Hirono, 1964), and linkage group 4 (Hirono and Redei, 1965). To map
the physiological mutants isolated at our laboratory, and to extend
the Arabidopsis gene map in general, a number of genes were located on
the different chromosomes by trisomic analysis (Koornneef and Van der
Veen, 1978). This led to a proper assigning of linkage groups to
chromosomes (Koornneef and Den Besten, 1979).<p>

The location of markers on chromosomes was followed by classical
linkage analyses. In this report preliminary results are given of
linkage studies that involve 8 markers of chromosome 4. This
chromosome was shown to carry the linkage group 6 marker vc-2 (which
we renamed cer-2) (Koornneef and Den besten, 1979). The information
thus far available for this linkage group was limited to reports of
linkage relative to vc-2. Redei (1967) mentioned close linkage of cc-2
with im. Robbelen (1972) linkage of vc-2 with a chlorophyll marker
repesented by the mutants V89, V300, V312 and V318. A recombinant
fraction of 0.185 +/- 0.033 of vc-2 and the lethal chlorophyll marker
ch 42 was reported by Fischerova (1975). Linkage of vc-2 with lu as
described by the latter author could not be confirmed by Koornneef and
Den Besten (1979).<p>

MATERIAL AND METHODS<p>

Marker genes<p>

All markers used for the experiments were recessive mutants induced at
Wageningen by EMS in the pure line Landsberg "erecta", except the vc-2
(cer-2) line used in the cross ga-1/cer-2 which was received from Dr.
Relichova at Brno. The cer-2 line used in other crosses with these
markers was the G8 line described by Dellaert et al., 1979, which was
found to be allelic to vc-2 (cer-2). A description of the markers used
is given in Table 1.<p>

Calculation of recombination fractions and map distances<p>

The majority of the recombination percentages were estimated from F2
data by the Product Ratio Method using the tables of Stevens (1939).<p>

In some cases a sample of aaB. phenotypes was progeny tested in F3 and
the fraction of heterozygotes b + f(aaBb)/f(aaB.) was used to estimate
the recombination fraction and its standard deviation as:<p>

When not all phenotypes could be distinguished recombination fractions
were etimated by the method of maximum likelihood. This was the case
in crosses of ag/cp with ga-1, where the compact growth habit of the
cp mutants could not be distinguished in ga-1 background.<p>

From the estimates of the recombination fractions, map distances were
estimated according to the method of Jensen and Jorgensen (1975). This
method was applied with recombination percentages corrected for double
crossovers by the mapping function of Kosambi (see also Jensen and
Jorgensen, 1975). When linkage between two markers was not
significant, then the estimates of recombination fractions between
them was not used for the ultimate calculation of map distances. The
order of the genes was determined from the estimated recombination
percentages and from the presence or absence of joint recombination in
multiple heterozygotes.<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

The estimates of the recombination percentages are presented in Table
2. The figures in Figure 1 give the map distances (cM) after
correction by the KOSAMBI mapping function. The ultimate map distances
estimated by the method of Jensen and Jorgensen are shown in Figure 2.
The analyses show that the order of the genes as proposed in Figure 1
seems well established except perhaps for cer-2. The recombination
percentages with its closely linked markers have large standard
deviations since they are mainly based on repulsion phase F2 analysis.
The location of cer-2 between ag and ga-5 is rather arbitrary since
the results obtained do not exclude a position between f ca and ag.
The total map length that could be calculated assuming the latter
position of cer-2 had a stnadard deviation only slightly larger than
the length of 70.4 +/- 3.0 cM calculated for the recombination
percentages and gene order as shown in Figure 1. By its total length
the provisional map of chromosome 4 is the largest linkage map
published for Arabidopsis up to now. However, maps of chromosome 1 and
5 are larger and exceed a length of 100 cM (Koornneef et al.,
unpublished). Thus the genetical length of the individual Arabidopsis
chromosomes is now of the same order as that of e.g. tomato and maize
(Rick, 1974; Neuffer and Coe, 1974). Construction of gene maps of all
other Arabidopsis chromosomes is in progress.<p>
