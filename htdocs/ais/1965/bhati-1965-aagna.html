Availability of Cu and Zn ions during EMS treatment was reported to
enhance the frequency of chromosomal aberrations (MOUTSCHENDAHMEN
1963).  Information on genetic effects of EMS in combination with
metallic ions is not available in literature.  We therefore planned an
experiment to study the interaction of Cu and Zn ions with EMS, at
three levels of pH, on chlorophyll mutation rate in Arabidopsis.  The
results are presented below.  Details are being published elsewhere.
The following additions to the EMS-solution were used:<p>
