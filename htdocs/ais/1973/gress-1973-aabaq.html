Haploid callus and plants were cultured from anthers of diploid A.
thaliana races considering (1) removal of anthers at late
prophase-metaphase I of meiosis, (2) selecting a genotype favourable
for callus formation from dividing microsporocytes on a moderate
auxin-moderate kinetin fully defined medium ad (3) a develpmental
sequence leading towards the complete plant via a callus stage rather
than direct embryoid induction.<p>

Mineral salts (GAMBORG and EVELEIGH, 1968) supplemented with vitamins,
trace-elements, iron-chelate, sucrose (2%), Difco-agar (0.8%), IAA (6
mg/l) and kinetin (1.5 mg/l) (GRESSHOFF and DOY, 1972) were used to
induce callus growth from excised anthers. Within 2-3 weeks of
incubation in the dark at 27*degrees*C and high relative humidity,
yellow callus grew through the anther wall of 3 out of 18 inbred races
(received from Dr. R.D. BROCK). These successful races were:
Wassileswkija (WS); Estland (EST), Martuba (MT).  We do not claim that
the other races will never produce haploid callus, however, they will
not with the small range of media and hormones that we tested.<p>

Differentiation of plants from callus was induced following transfer
of callus to BLAYDES' mineral salts (BLAYDES, 1966) supplemented with
vitamins, trace elements, iron chelate, sucrose (2%), Difco-agar
(0.8%). NAA (0.5 mg/l) and Kinetin (10 mg/l), which was then incubated
at 27*degrees*C in a 16 hr light-dark cycle (GRESSHOFF and DOY, 1972).
Plants were sterile as expected for their haploid condition, but they
developed normally otherwise (Fig. 1).<p>

After one year of culture, these callus cell lines have remained
hyploid.<p>
