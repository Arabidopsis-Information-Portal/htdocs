<h2>GIBBERELLIN-SENSITIVE MUTANTS IN ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA</h2><p>

The wellknown gibberellin biosynthesis mutants that are described a.o.
in maize (Phinney, 1961) and in rice (Murakami, 1970), do germinate
normally but develop into dwarfs. In a previous report (Koornneef et
al., 1977) we described a second class of gibbberellin-sensitive
mutants which for germination require the application of GA. Without
further addition of GA they develop into typical dwarfs but with
repeated GA spray they obtain the wildtype habitus, or nearly so.<p>

We have now extended our collection of 9 nongerminating GA-sensitive
mutants to 33 independent mutants (EMS and neutron induced) of which
so far 26 have been tested for allelism by complementation tests
(Table 1). They are still restricted to 3 unlinked loci, for which the
gene symbol ga is proposed.<p>

Table 1: Results of complementation tests with GA-sensitive mutants<p>

As the first class of mutants, viz. normally germinating GA-sensitive
dwarfs, can also be expected in Arabidopsis, we tested a large number
of dwarfs (selected from M2 lines) for GA-sensitivity by weekly
spraying them with a 10E-4M GA 4+7 solution. The majority racted only
slightly, i.e., not more than the wildtype does.<p>

Until now 12 independently induced well-responding dwarfs have been
isolated. Our criterium is that only dwarfs which by repeated GA-spray
can be completely restored to the wildtype phenotype, or nearly so,
should be called GA-sensitive dwarfs. So we exclude the caespitosa
mutant from race "Estland" (Bost, 1974) which is described as reacting
to a high GA3 concentration by a length increase from 2 cm to only 5
cm.<p>

Most of our GA-sensitive dwarfs closely resemble the dwarfs phenotype
resulting after germination induction of the nongerminating mutants,
i.e., they had dark green leaves, reduced apical dominance of the main
stem, nonelongated petals, etc. Mutant Bo-19 (Figure 1c) however is
not a typical GA dwarf, but is taller and should be rather called a
miniature variant of the wildtype (Landsberg-"erecta").<p>

a. NG5(ga-1) without and with GA4+7 spray, both with added GA4+7 to
obtain germination.<p>

b. V330 (ga-2) without and with GA4+7 spray (GA-sensitive dwarf)<p>

c. BO-19 (ga-5) without and with GA4+7 spray (GA-sensitive dwarf)<p>

d. Wildtype without and with GA4+7 spray<p>

Complementation tests (Table 1) showed that 4 of the 6 dwarfs tested
so far are allelic to the nongermination loci ga-1 and ga-2, while the
other two dwarfs are mutants at two other loci, viz. ga-4 and ga-5
(Bo-19). Locus ga-5 is linked to ga-1.<p>

The distinction between the two classes, viz. germinating vs.
nongerminating dwarfs, should be handled with some caution, especially
with segregating generations from crosses between the two classes. The
reasons are:<p>

1. Factors known to influence seed dormancy and germination, such as
storage, cold treatment after sowing, KNO3, light quality and
intensity (see e.g. Shropshire et al., 1961; Gettens-Hayes and Klein,
1974), and also time of harvesting and maternal genotype, can induce,
when rightly adjusted, a proportion of the seeds of the nongerminating
homozygous lines, to germinate. However the resulting seedlings
develop into extremely small dwarfs. The effect of the factors
mentioned will be described into more detail elsewhere.<p>

2. Some of the germinating mutants, vis. those dwarfs which are
allelic to nongerminating dwarfs sometimes show a reduced germination
percentage as compared with the control (ripening conditions, storage
duration, etc.).<p>

The details of gibberellin biosynthesis in higher plants are fairly
well known (for a recent review see Barendse, 1975). Mevalonate is
converted via a.o. kaurene into gibberellins, both active and inactive
ones. In many cases the different gibberellins can be interconverted.
It then becomes attractive to speculate that there are two classes of
gibberellin biosynthesis mutants, viz. those affecting enzymes at the
start of the pathway and therefore completely preventing biosynthesis
(except of course for leaky mutants) and those controlling the
interconversion of the gibberellins and may be these two classes lead
to different phenotypes.<p>

We are now proceeding with the genetical analysis (e.g., locating the
genes by linkage studies with markers and by trisomic analysis). We
have also started to determine the GA content of the mutants and the
wildtype. Preliminary results are promising.<p>
