Union Biometrica is an equal opportunity employer.  We are a small team of 
highly motivated scientists / engineers designing and delivering specialty flow 
cytometers for high speed analysis and gentle sorting of objects which are too 
large (20-1,500 microns) and too fragile for traditional cytometers.  Examples 
include: 
*	small model organisms (C. elegans, D. melanogaster, zebrafish, etc)  
*	large fragile cells/cell clusters (pancreatic islets, stem cells, adipocytes, 
hepatocytes, and duct cells)
