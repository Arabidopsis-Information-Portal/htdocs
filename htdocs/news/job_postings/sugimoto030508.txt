A Postdoctoral Scientist Position at the Plant Sciences Center, RIKEN 
Yokohama Institute 
 
 
 
A postdoctoral scientist position is available from April 2008 to study the 
size and ploidy control in plants. The successful candidate will 
characterize novel loss-of-function or gain-of-function mutants in 
Arabidopsis that display various developmental defects associated with 
ploidy. The research will be conducted in Keiko Sugimoto's lab 
(http://labs.psc.riken.jp/cfru/English/index.html) at the RIKEN Plant 
Science Center situated in Yokohama, Japan. RIKEN Plant Science Center has 
state-of-the-art facilities for genome, proteome and metabolome research. 
 
 
 
Applicants should have a PhD in plant molecular biology, developmental 
genetics, or cell biology. Experience in Arabidopsis molecular genetics or 
cell biology is highly desirable. This post is for up to 3 years, pending on 
the annual assessment. Please visit the RIKEN website for further detail.
