Until now, mutants affecting gibberellin metabolism have only been
found among dwarf genotypes, e.g., in maize (Phinney, 1961) and in
rice (Murakami, 1970).  Since it seems apparent that endogenous growth
regulators play an important role in the control of seed germination
(e.g. Mayer and Shain, 1974), it occurred to us that mutations in
genes controlling plant hormone metabolism might cause seeds not to
germinate.<p>

M1 plants from mutagen treated seeds of race Landsberg erecta were
individually harvested (siliquae from the top of the main stem, which
in general is nonchimeric).  M2 lines were selected which segregated 3
germinating: 1 non-germinating (but otherwise well developed) seeds.
With the hormones tested (GA3, GA4+7, NAA, FAP) we found that among
seven lines two (NG4 and NG5) responded, vis. to gibberellic acid
(Table 1).<p>

Without further gibberellic acid spray, the recovered mutant seedlings
(upon planting out in soil) developed into dark green dwarfs, which
later on showed a bushy appearance.  Petals and stamens were very
poorly developed, pistels and sepals were almost normal, and flowering
time was not affected. Seed set can be obtained by pollen of normal
plants (Figure 1).  No selfed seed is formed. By spraying these dwarfs
with gibberellic acid the phenotype of the control is restored (Table
2) except that the stem of the mutant is slightly thinner. Seed set is
complete, and homozygous mutant lines are maintained in this way.<p>

Table 2: Plant length (in cm) 5 1/2 week after planting of gibberellic
acid responsive mutants and of their normal sister plants (NG 4, NG 5)
after spraying with a solution of 200 mgr/1 GA3.  Number of plants per
item: 40-50 for H20, 18-16 for GA3.<p>

Both for germination and for subsequent growth GA4+7 proved to be more
effective than GA3 although both gibberellins can change the mutant
phenotype to normal when the concentration is high enough.<p>

These results indicate that mutants NG4 and NG5 probably have a block
in gibberellin synthesis and that gibberellin synthesis is an absolute
necessity for germination and subsequent growth of Arabidopsis
thaliana.<p>

Until now, nine independent mutants of this type have been obtained at
our laboratory from EMS treated seeds and from seeds irradiated with
neutrons, all having the same appearance as NG 4 and NG 5. Eight
hundred M2 lines from seeds treated with ten mM EMS for twenty four
hours gave five mutant lines.  Preliminary results of complementation
tests with seven of the mutant lines seem to indicate the existence of
at least three loci (NG 4 and NG 5 are allelic).<p>

Gibberellin responsive mutants are very suitable for investigating the
genetics of gibberellin metabolism and the role of gibberellins in
plant development. Besides they provide an example of auxotrophic
mutants which are rare in higher plants (REDEI, 1975).  At the moment
we try to isolate more mutants and to analyse them into more detail
both genetically and physiologically.<p>
