Help for RI maps</H1></CENTER>

<P>Full details of how the maps are constructed can be found in our previous
article "<A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk:8300/Vol3iii/mapping_paper/RI_maps.interpretation.html" target="_top">Mapping
and map interpretation - a learning experience</A>"

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<H3>
Naming conventions</H3>
There have been some general changes to the maps since the last publication
of the data. Possibly most important of these changes is the introduction
of "<A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk:8300/cgi-bin/w3-msql/mapmaker/synonyms.html" target="_top">Synonyms</A>"
for marker names, which have been introduced to accommodate marker name
changes which have been requested e.g a working marker name may be given
in the early stages of mapping and/or characterisation which is then changed
at the time of publishing the data.&nbsp; In order to allow markers to
be recognised by their original or published name the information about
its previous name(s) is included in more detailed marker information page,
along with a comment as to why/who changed the name.

<P>Additionally, some of the markers which had previously contained hyphens
in their names have been renamed to contain an underscore instead, for
example marker SAUR-AC1 IS THE&nbsp;SAME AS marker SAUR_AC1. This affects
only a small number of markers and was done to aid map curation.

<P>The maps are displayed in two different ways.
<H3>
Text Version</H3>
The text display of the maps has now been improved to make the information
more useful. Markers are shown to be either framework markers, to have
a unique position or to have multiple positions&nbsp; which also shows
the number of potential positions this marker may have. In interpreting
the multiple positions, it should be noted that the position it is placed
at is the MOST LIKELY position based upon two-point calculations of the
data.

<P>All the markers are now "clickable" and will take you to detailed information
about them, including the contact information which has been hard to access
in the past. Full details of the calculated two-point data can also be
retrieved, but this can be a large dataset and can take several minutes
to download.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>
<HR WIDTH="80%">
<H3>
Graphical Version</H3>
The way the information is displayed as a GIF has changed in a way that
we hope will make it easier to interpret the information. The framework
markers are now drawn to the left of the central chromosome and are coloured
blue. The markers which are assigned to the chromosome by linkage are displayed
to the right of the central chromosome and are coloured differently to
indicate the certainty of their placement. Unique placements are coloured
black and markers which potentially have more than one position are coloured
red. All the loci in the images are now "clickable" which will take you
to more detailed information about the marker, including contact information
which has been so hard to access in the past. Other details include the
details of which chromosome the marker maps to, how many possible positions
(of which the one shown is MOST LIKELY) the marker has, and the date when
the marker was last mapped onto the large map. Full details of the two-point
data can also be obtained, but be warned, this can be quite a large dataset
and can take several minutes to download.

<P>In addition, all the data is now available through <A HREF="http://synteny.nott.ac.uk/arabidopsis.html#Adev" target="_top">AGR
</A>and from the <A HREF="ftp://nasc.nott.ac.uk/pub/RI_data" target="_top&quot;">NASC
FTP site</A>.
