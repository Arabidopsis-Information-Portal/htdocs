A further number of local populations of Arabidopsis thaliana from the
Rhineland have been included in our recent studies on the population
genetics (cf. NAPP-ZINN, 1964) and on the geographical distribution of
"vernalization genes".  Seeds have been harvested separately from 8 to
150 single plants of each population concerned. Seed was stored at
room temperature.  In the following paragraphs I report preliminary
investigations of the germination behaviour in selected individual
progenies from the following populations (breeding no. and dates of
harvest are indicated):<p>

I.  Koln-Braunsfeld, Aachener Str. 458, terrain of the Clarenbach
Church: L3244s (May 28, 1974)<p>

II.  Odenthal-Scherf, slopes at the way out of the village towards
Schallemich: L3256s (May 14, 1974)<p>

III.  Eberbach/Rheingau monastery, between paving-stones: L3264s and
L3273s (May 14, 1974)<p>

IV.  Lohmar-Geber, slopes at the way to Ingr, shortly before the
Federal Road no. 507: L3372s (May 22, 1974), L3424s (May 28, l974),
and L3457s (June 12, 1974)<p>

V.  Koln-Lindenthal, Kerpener Str. and Univrsitatsstr., terrain of the
University Library: L3491s and L3492s (June 12, 1974)<p>

100 seeds per Petri dish of 9 cm diameter were placed on filter paper
that was moistened with 2 ml of distilled water.  There were two
variants of treatment: one (A) was kept at light (natural day length),
the other one (B) at darkness for 39 days, then light for 8 days,
afterwards +7 to 8*degrees*C and darkness in a refrigerator for about
3 weeks, and finally again 20 to 23*degrees*C (first sowing) or 23 to
25*degrees*C (second sowing) and light 8 days.  Some results are
summarized in Tables 1 and 2.<p>

Obviously the seeds of population IV plants only had a strong
requirement of after ripening which had not been overcome even 8 or 9
months after harvest.  On the other hand, all families considered here
but L3264s, showed a pronounced light requirement with regard to
germination; but they reacted, at the first sowing, in three different
ways after 39 days of darkness (interrupted evey third or fourth day
for a few minutes only when counting the germinated seeds):<p>

1.  In population I darkness induced an inhibition that even persisted
after cold treatment and exposure to light.<p>

2.  In the populations II, III(L3273s), and IV darkness induced an
inhibition of germination that only was removed to a considerable
degree by the cold treatment.<p>

3.  In population V part of the seeds already germinated as soon as
they had been transferred from darkness to light.<p>

At the second sowing, the families L3256s (population II) and L3491s
(population V) approached to the first type, whereas they formerly had
corresponded to the third or second types, respectively.<p>
