As mentioned in this volume, page 24, genes for pyrimidine synthesis
fall into 3 groups based on complementation relations.  A possible
explanation is that py-1 and py-2 belong to adjacent cistrons, and
that mutants of the class py-d possess a deletion covering parts of
both the cistrons to which py-1 and py-2 belong.  To test whether
recombination can occur between py-1 and py-2, crosses were made
between mutants out of these series, and the hybrid was crossed both
with the wild type (A), and with the mutant py-d (B).<p>

With (A), the first backcross generation is wild type, and only after
selfing of these plants the recombination frequency can be estimated
in the next generation from the number of nonsegregating families.
270 families were tested, none of these were non-segregating, which
means that F1 did not yield ++ gametes.<p>

With (B), plants originating without recombination are all deficient
for pyrimidine synthesis, only after recombination wild type plants
can occur.  No wild types were found among 2673 test-cross plants.  If
recombination can occur, the frequency is expected to be smaller than
approx. 7 x 10E-4.<p>

At the moment crossing according to scheme B is being repeated at a
larger scale, to obtain further information.<p>

Recombination between genes tz-1 and tz-2 for thiazole synthesis so
far has been tested only according to scheme A; 139 progenies tested
failed to show recombination.<p>
