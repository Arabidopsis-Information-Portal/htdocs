The aim of the following measurements was to estimate the pH inside
the Arabidopsis seed after soaking in water and to determine whether
buffers at different pH can influence the pH inside the seed.<p>

For the pH measurements the range indicator method (R.I.M.) of SMALL
(1965) was used.  Seeds of Arabidopsis, soaked for 24 hours in
Britton-Robinson I buffer of pH 3 or pH 11 or in distilled water were
washed briefly in neutral water; then the seed-coat was removed.  The
naked embryos were put into a drop of the indicator.  After
approximately 30 min the embryos were rinsed briefly in neutral water
and the colour of the embryos was evaluated under a microscope.  The
indicators, given in the Table, were dissolved in 20% ethanol, only
methyl red was dissolved in 60% ethanol.  As demonstrated in the
Table, the pH of the seed embryos was in the range of pH 4.4 to 5.2,
regardless if the seeds were soaked for 24 hrs in water or in buffers
adjusted to pH 3 or pH 11.  This proves a high buffering capacity of
Arabidopsis seeds.<p>
