The Affymetrix probe set names and sequences were obtained from <a href="http://www.affymetrix.com/index.affx">Affymetrix</a>.
The AFGC data were obtained from <a href="http://genome-www5.stanford.edu/MicroArray/SMD/">SMD</a> and <a href="http://afgc.stanford.edu/afgc_html/site2.htm">AFGC</a>, which included array element name (clone_id)
and type, sequence information, and organism. The expression profiles were produced by AFGC and are available from SMD (Spot History) and TAIR (Expression Viewer). Additional data, such as locus identifiers,
annotation, and array element type were generated by TAIR curators.
    <P>
The locus assignments were obtained by blasting the array element sequences
against the Arabidopsis BACs from TIGR (January 2002 release) using BLASTN
with an e-value cut-off of 1e-6. Then sim4 was run (P=1, A=0) on the array
element sequences against best 2 BAC matches obtained by BLAST, and only
matched segments with identities greater than 90% were kept. The associated locus was determined by a comparison of the array element match coordinates with
the coordinates of the loci on the BACs, keeping the best match with the
longest overlaping sequence. The annotations were from TIGR's genome release of
January 2002.

All the data files are available for download from the <a href="ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/home/tair/Microarrays/">ftp site</a>
