<H1>Workshop 2 : Gene and Protein Function</H1>
<h4>Chair: Ottoline Leyser, University of York, UK. and Malcolm Bennett, University of Warwick, UK.</h4>
<b>email: </b><a href="mailto:hmol1@unix.york.ac.uk">Ottoline Leyser (hmol1@unix.york.ac.uk)</a> and <a href="mailto:bt@dna.bio.warwick.ac.uk">Malcolm Bennett (bt@dna.bio.warwick.ac.uk)</a>

The main aim of this workshop was to highlight the range of methods available
for determining the biological and biochemical functions of cloned genes
and their products. The first half dealt 
with methods based on a genetic approach, whilst the second half dealt with
protein level approaches.<p>
The first 2 speakers addressed targeted gene disruption.<A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Norwich/sessions/S36.html" target="_top"> Andy Pereira</A> from
(CPRO-DLO, The Netherlands) described how the maize transposon En-1 could
be used as a powerful insertional 
mutagen. Transposition can be replicative, so lines with a multiple but
manageable number of inserts can be generated. A constitutively expressed
transposase can drive highly active En-1 
transposition which occurs preferentially to linked sites. This system has
already been used successfully as a random mutagen, to target know mutationally
defined genes, and to target ORFs of unknown function. 
<p>
<A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Norwich/sessions/S38.html" target="_top">Eric Lam </A>(Rutgers University, USA) then described progress toward developing
an efficient system for homologous gene disruption, allowing the replacement
of any cloned gene with other desired sequences. Homologous recombination
is clearly possible and its efficiency is improving 
with the introduction of vacuum infiltration for transformation and new
selectable markers to weed out illegitimate recombination events.
 <p>
<A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Norwich/sessions/S39.html" target="_top">Nigel Kilby</A> (Cambridge University, UK) described the transfer of FLP/FRT site-specific recombinase system from yeast to <I>Arabidopsis</I>, where it is
clearly able to function. This system can 
be used to generate genetic mosaics which would be very useful in cell autonomy
studies and in allowing the study of post-embryonic functions of genes absolutely
required for embryo development. 
<p>
In the final talk before tea,<A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Norwich/sessions/S40.html" target="_top"> Mark Estelle</A> (Indiana University, USA) described
how yeast homologues were helping to determine the biochemical function
of the <I>AXR1</I> protein. This gene, known to be involved in auxin signalling,
has homology to the amino-terminal half of ubiquitin activating enzyme,
but the significance of this homology is unclear. With the yeast genome
completely sequenced, anyone lucky enough to find a yeast homologue for
their gene can bring the power of yeast genetics to bare on the problem.
In this case, a yeast <I>AXR1</I>-like protein was shown to interact genetically
with a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, <I>CDC34</I> which is thought to be involved
in cyclin degradation.
<p>

The second half of the workshop addressed the topic of protein function.
The first 3 speakers described a selection of heterologous expression systems
which have proved useful experimental 
systems to study plant protein function. <A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Norwich/sessions/S41.html" target="_top">Dan Bush</A> (University of Illinois,
USA) summarised his latest work with plant amino acid permeases which went
far &quot;beyond functional complementation in 
yeast&quot;. He outlined his yeast-based mutational approach which has started
to yield detailed information about the residues within the plant amino
acid permeases which determine various transport parameters. <p>
<A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Norwich/sessions/S42.html" target="_top">Richard Napier</A> (HRI Wellesborne, UK) detailed the latest work on auxin binding
protein 1 (<I>ABP1</I>), describing how insect cells have proved to be the ideal
expression system to compare and contrast the intracellular targeting characteristics
of wildtype and KDEL-sequence variants of <I>ABP1</I>. In addition, he presented
experimental data about the heterologous expression of the membrane-localised
<I>AUX1</I> polypeptide, a putative IAA uptake carrier. <A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Norwich/sessions/S43.html" target="_top">Freddy Theodoulou</A> (IACR-Rothamstead,
UK) provided an excellent overview of the <I>Xenopus</I> oocyte expression system,
highlighting its practical advantages and disadvantages. Freddy illustrated
her talk with examples of soluble and membrane-localised plant proteins
which have been successfully studied in 
oocytes, concluding with results she has obtained using an electrophysiology-based
study of plant sugar carriers. <p>
The workshop was concluded by <A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Norwich/sessions/S44.html" target="_top">Jim Hasseloff</A> (MRC-LMB, Cambridge, UK) who
provided a beautifully illustrated video presentation of the applications
of Green Fluorescent Protein 
(GFP)-based imaging to study protein intracellular targeting. Jim described
his lab's work to improve GFP's characteristics for expression in transgenic
<I>Arabidopsis</I>. GFP has been targeted to 
various organelles in order to reduce its cytotoxicity, plus novel GFP spectral
variants have been selected in <I>E.coli</I> which feature altered excitation spectra
and improved light emission.
