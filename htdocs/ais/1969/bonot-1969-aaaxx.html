We have previously described a method for the extraction of
Arabidopsis RNA (BONOTTO and JACOBS, 1967) and for the separation of
ribosomal RNA (r-RNA) from soluble RNA (s-RNA) BONOTTO and JACOBS,
1968).<p>

The RNA extracted by these methods from 1 month old Arabidopsis plants
was tested for its sedimentation constant.  Unlabelled Arabidopsis RNA
was layered together with a small amount of labelled RNA (3H-RNA) from
Acetabularia mediterranea, on the top of 4.6 ml of 5-20% sucrose
gradients, containing 50 micro g/ml PVS, and centrifuged 5 hrs at
37.500 rev/min in the SW 40 rotor of the Martin &#199;hrist
ultra-centrifuge. Two drop fractions, collected by puncturing the
bottoms of the tubes, were diluted with 0.9 ml of distilled water and
the absorbance at 260 m micro was measured in the Cary
spectrophotometer. The radioactivity of each fraction was measured in
a Packard liquid scintillation counter.<p>

The figure shows the centrifugation pattern of unlabelled Arabidopsis
RNA and of labelled Acetaburlaria RNA having sedimentation values of
23 S, 17 S and 8 S respectively (BONOTTO and JANOWSKI, unpublished
results).<p>

The approximate sedimentation constant of Arabidopsis RNA, calculated
from these values, amounts to 25 S, 16 S, and 3 S for the heavy r-RNA,
the light r-RNA and the soluble RNA respectively.  In another
experiment, not reported here, unlabelled Arabidopsis r-RNA was
centrifuged together with labelled Acetabularia RNA (3H-RNA), having a
sedimentation constant of 15 S.  THe results obtained showed clearly
that the light r-RNA of Arabidopsis is heavier than 15 S Acetabularia
RNA; again its calculated constant was 16 S.<p>

Figure: Sedimentation pattern of unlabelled r-RNA and s-RNA extracted
from 1 month old Arabidopsis plants (closed circles) and of labelled RNA from
Acetabularia mediterranea (open circles).  The unicellular algae were incubated
30 min in sea-water medium containing 10 uc/ml of Uridine-5-3H.  The
numbers at the top of the graph represent the sedimentation constant
values.<p>

The values of the sedimentation constant reported here for total
Arabidopsis r-RNA (25 S and 16 S) are in agreement with several recent
reports on the RNA of higher plants (CLICK and HACKETT, 1966; SPENCER
and WHITFELD, 1967; STUTZ and NOLL, 1967; HADZIYEV, MEHTA and ZALIK,
1968).<p>
