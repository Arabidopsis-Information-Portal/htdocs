INTRODUCTION<p>

The seeds of various genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana have a typical
red, far-red reversible photoresponse in germination, indicating the
involvement of the phytochrome system (Shropshire et al., 1961; Kranz,
1974). Blue light also has similar inhibitory effect as far-red light
on the seed germination of Arabidopsis plant (Ritzel, 1977). The
effect of blue light on plant development has been noticed as the high
irradiance reaction which may act on the plant in a different way from
phytochrome. On the other hand, Sugai and Furuya (19687) have found
the blue light absorbing pigment in a fern Pteris Vittata that might
be involved in the inhibition of phytochrome-mediated spore
germination.<p>

The present paper describes the results of an attempt to compare the
red, far-red reversible response and the red, blue reversible response
in the induction of seed germination of Arabidopsis thaliana.<p>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<p>

Germination test<p>

Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana (strain F) were harvested from plants
grown in a green house of our laboratory in spring 1982. Strain F is
favourable to germination experiments because of less dormancy and its
typical red, far-red reversible photoreaction in germination.<p>

The seeds in lots of 100 were sown on 0.8% agar (5 ml) in a small
petri dish (3 cm diameter). The seeds were kept in a light-tight
container at 3*degrees*C for 24 hours and then at 25*degrees*C for 24
hours. Appropriate irradiation was then given and germination
percentages were determined after additional incubation in darkness at
25*degrees*C for 5 days. KNO 3 (10E-2 M) and GA 3 (10E-4 M, pH 6.0
adjusted with 0.05 M KOH) were given from the agar medium. Ethyulene
(ca. 170 ppm) was applied to a sealed polyethylene container in which
dishes were placed.<p>

Light source<p>

The source of red light was a 20 W red fluorescent lamp (National
FL20RF, *lambda*max. ca. 660 nm) with a filter of 3 mm thick red acryl
plate. Blue light was provided by a 20 W blue fluorescent lamp
(National FL20BF, *lambda*max. ca. 450 nm) with a filter of 3 mm thick blue
acryl plate. Far-red light was supplied by a 125 W medical infrared
lamp (Toshiba, *lambda*max. 1350 nm of above 600 nm) placed above a
container, which had a 10 cm depth of water layer and also 3 mm thick
red and blue acryl plates. The intensities of all the three lights
were about 70 microW/cm 2 at the seed level.<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

Experiments were performed from Nov. 1982 to Feb. 1983. Table 1 shows
the effect of red, far-red and blue light on the germination rate of
seeds incubated on three growth factors. The red light-induced effect
was nullified by immediate and subsequent exposure to far-red or blue
light, and both the effects of red and far-red, and red and blue were
found to be repeatedly reversible when cyclic exposures were applied
to the seeds. The nullifying effect of far-red light was almost
complete, but that of blue light was somewhat incomplete. The result
of cyclic exposures of far-red and blue light indicates that blue
light has a weak germination inducing effect. The presence of red,
blue reversible response suggests that the blue light effect on the
seed germination of Arabidopsis is not related with the blue light
absorbing pigment found from Pteris vittata (Sugai and Furuya, 1967),
which lacks both the red, blue, red reversibilities.<p>

Since it is possible that the red, blue reversibility may be mediated
through a different system from the phytochrome, three factors
promoting germination were tested to determine whether the factors
affect blue light inhibition in the same way as they affect far-red
light inhibition. The aspects of photoreversibility in both the
additions of KNO 3 and ethylene showed almost similar to that of
control (Table 1). GA 3 eliminated both photoinhibitions and both
photoreversibilities. Far-red and blue light, therefore, appear to
have identical interactions under various germinating conditions.<p>

Red, far-red and red, blue reversibilities in relatively long periods
of irradiation were examined (Figure 1). The seeds were exposed to
red, far-red or blue light for 1 h and then to far-red, blue or red
light for various periods of time. The inhibitory effect of blue light
was always lower than that of far-red light, and the reversible effect
by red light was always greater in blue light than in far-red light.<p>

Figure 2: The rate of escape of seeds from the inhibition of far-red
or blue light. Seeds were irradiated with red light for 1 h, incubated
in the dark for varying periods, and then irradiated with far-red or
blue light for 0.5 h.<p>

Figure 2 shows the effect of an intervening darkness between red and
far-red or red and blue irradiations on the reversibility of
germination rate. The seeds were exposed to red light and returned to
darkness for various periods of time before exposure to far-red or
blue light. Under far-red light, germination was completely inhibited
for 2 hours and then the seeds gradually escaped from the inhibitory
effect due to the increasing duration of the dark intervals. The
escape reaction was complete by the 7th hour and a 50% loss was found
after 5.5 hrs of darkness. The time at which the seeds escaped from
far-red inhibition may represent the duration of P fr action (Cone,
1982). On the other hand, the escape reaction from the inhibition by
blue light began almost immediately after the red light irradiation
and was complete by 6th hour, and the 50% loss was found on about 2.5
hour. This result may mean that far-red light transforms P r into P fr
completely but blue light does so incompletely.<p>

Blue light is known to influence the phytochrome-mediated responses in
growth of pea stem (Bertsch, 1963) and rice coleoptile (PJON and
FURUYA, 1967). The data presented here suggest that both the blue
light inhibition and its recovery by red light in the seed germination
also are controlled by phytochrome system. Since the absorption
spectrum of purified phytochrome shows a second prominent peak at 375
nm for P r and 400 nm for P fr (Mumford and Jenner, 1966),
photochemical transformation of phytochrome can take place by blue
light, establishing a photostationary state. Therefore, blue
irradiation mimics far-red light in the seed germination of
Arabidopsis, while it also mimics red light in the grows of pea stem
and rice coleoptile.<p>

In the seed germination, the inhibitory effect of blue light was
always lower than that of far-red light when the intensity was the
same. This fact may indicate that the photostationary state of
phytochrome by blue irradiation is equilibrated in a greater P fr
state compared with that by far-red light.<p>
