Postdoctoral Fellow Positions in Statistical Genetics and Population Genetics 

Several postdoctoral positions in statistical genetics and population genetics are immediately 
available in the group of Dr Magnus Nordborg at the Gregor Mendel Institute of Molecular Plant 
Biology in Vienna, Austria. Major projects include genome-wide association mapping and systems 
genetics using 1,001 fully sequenced lines of Arabidopsis thaliana, speciation genetics in a variety 
of plant species, and population genetics of vervet monkeys. More information is available 
http://www.gmi.oeaw.ac.at/research-groups/magnus-nordborg.

Applicants are expected to have completed (or be close to completing) a PhD in a closely related 
field, to have published (or be close to publishing) in major international journals, and have 
experience with genomic data (e.g., next-generation sequencing data) as well as strong quantitative 
training (including programming). Please send an e-mail describing your background and interest in 
our projects, accompanied by a CV and the names of three referees to magnus.nordborg@gmi.oeaw.ac.at.

Applications are open now and will be considered until positions are filled.
