Chimerism of monocotyledons induced by mutagenic treatment during
early stages of embryogenesis was studied in maize by Stadler (1930)
and in barley by Mericle and Mericle (1962). Our aim was to study this
phenomenon in dicotyledonous plant A. thaliana.<p>

The growing of A. thaliana plants, their gamma-irradiation at
different phases of flower development, cytological preparation
technique were described in the previous paper (Shevchenko et al.,
1978). X1 plants were grown in soil culture and chlorophyll deficient
mutations were scored irrespectively their embryo size using the
embryo test. Ten or more pods of the apical inflorescence and 5 or
more pods of cauline and rosette inflorescences were analysed.<p>

After irradiation of the flowers before fertilization only nonchimeric
plants were observed. In each plant we analyzed apical, cauline and
rosette inflorescences. All in all, we scored 63 mutant plants.
Chimeric plants (6 among 15 plants) were found after irradiation of
the flowers at the phase B 2/4. Cytological analyses of the ovules in
these flowers showed that a part of them had zygotes and the other
part had embryos in which the apical cell was undivided or it divided
only once. After irradiation of the flowers at the phase B5 ther
percentage of chimeric plants increased (17 among 23 mutants). The
nonchimeric plants observed could arise due to asynchronous
development of embryos in a pod and due to the loss of the activity by
initial cells in the course of plant development.<p>

Another experiment in which the flowers were irradiated every two
hours after pollination was also carried out. Plants were grown in
soil and dishes (13 x 18 cm), flowers at the phase B 1/4 wre
emasculated and 24 hours later pollinated. Then the plants were
irradiated with doses of 5 and 6 kr every 2 hours during a period of
20 hours after pollination.<p>

As can be seen from Table 1 only nonchimeric plants were observed
after irradiation of the flowers in the period from 0 to 10 hours
after pollination; all in all, 106 mutant plants were analyzed. The
first chimeric plants were observed when the flowers were irradiated
12 hours after pollination. At that time the flowers were at the late
phase B 2/4 and the most developed embryos had once divided apical
cells. Thus, chimeric plants were induced after irradiation at the
early stages of embryo development starting from the first division of
the apical cell of the embyro.<p>

It should be noted that the induction of chimerism in the shoot apex
took place after irradiation at those stages of embryo development at
which there was no differentiation. Though this fact gives us no
information about the time when the apical meristem began to form, it
enables us to conclude that the apical meristem originated not from
one cell but from a group of cells which might consist of no less than
two cells. Mericle and Mericle (1962) pointed out the ear apical
meristem in barley could originate from one cell because chimeric ears
were not observed after irradiation of the embryos up to the
differentiation stage.<p>
