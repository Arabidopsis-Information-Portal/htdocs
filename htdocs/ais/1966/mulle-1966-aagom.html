	Pretreatment with the chelating agent ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) was reported to enhance the frequency of chromosomal aberrations induced by N-nitroso-N-methylurea (NMH) in growing root meristems of Vicia faba (MICHAELIS et al., 1965).  We, therefore, studied the influence of pretreatments with EDTA (Na-salt) on the frequency of recessive lethals induced by NMH in dormant seeds of Arabidopsis.<p>
