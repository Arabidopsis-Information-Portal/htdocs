Postdoctoral position in molecular mechanisms of plant-virus interactions 

A full-time postdoctoral Research Associate position is available in the 
team of Molecular Virology at the Institut Jacques Monod, Paris, France 
(http://www.ijm.fr/en/ijm/home-page/) as part of a project funded by the 
ANR. This position is initially funded for 2 years with possible 
extension. 

A multidisciplinary approach using a combination of molecular, cell 
biology, biochemistry and systems biology methodologies will be developed 
to study the roles and mechanisms by which the ubiquitylation system 
regulates the interaction of Arabidopsis with viruses (Camborde et al. 
Plant Cell (2010), Chenon et al. EMBO J. (2012)). 

We are looking for a highly motivated candidate with a PhD degree, a 
strong background in molecular biology, biochemistry or plant biology, and 
a good record of peer-reviewed publications. Excellent writing and oral 
communication skills are essential. 
Previous experience in molecular plant-microbe interactions is a plus, but 
not a formal requirement. 

The application should be submitted electronically as a single pdf file to 
Dr. Isabelle Jupin (jupin@ijm.univ-paris-diderot.fr) and should contain a 
cover letter summarizing qualifications and motivation to work on this 
project, a CV with a full publication list, and names and contacts of 
three references. Reviews of applications will begin immediately and the 
position will remain open until filled.
