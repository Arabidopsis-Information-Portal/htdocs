Postdoctoral Position available in Epigenetic Inheritance at University of Cambridge 
 
Meiotic chromosomes pair and undergo homologous recombination, which has important 
consequences for patterns of natural variation and our ability to utilize it through 
breeding. Recombination patterns are highly non-random along chromosomes, though the 
mechanisms underlying these distributions are not well understood. The project will test 
the role of epigenetic information, including DNA methylation and small RNAs, on 
meiotic recombination patterns. A combination of genetic, genomic and cytological tools 
will be used in Arabidopsis thaliana to address these questions.

Arabidopsis Technician Position available at University of Cambridge 
 
A technician is sought to help run projects relating to epigenetic inheritance during 
meiosis in Arabidopsis thaliana. This will involve propagation of seed stocks and 
performing genetic experiments. Additionally the technician will perform genotyping and 
basic molecular biology, including cloning. Applicants will ideally have relevant 
experience in plant science and molecular biology. Interested applicants should send their 
C.V., including details for three references to;
