Postdoctoral Fellow (Arabidopsis functional evolutionary genetics) 
Genetics & Biotechnology Lab, University College Cork, Ireland 
The lab of Dr. Charles Spillane is seeking a highly motivated postdoc to work on 
functional evolutionary genomics of rapidly evolving genes within the Arabidopsis 
genome. The successful applicant will work within a small team of Arabidopsis 
researchers investigating genetics and epigenetics of reproduction/seed development. We 
seek enthusiastic and highly motivated candidates with excellent and proven (as 
evidenced by publications) skills in plant (Arabidopsis) molecular genetics, functional 
genomics, molecular evolution, bioinformatics, DIC/fluorescence microscopy and/or in 
situ hybridisation in Arabidopsis thaliana. The project is funded for three years, and will 
build on ongoing collaborations with other Arabidopsis groups, including the group of 
Prof. Karl Schmid (Dept of Plant Biology and Forest Genetics, Swedish University of 
Agricultural Sciences (SLU), Uppsala, Sweden). Salary for the position will be ~ €40,000 
per annum. 
Prospective applicants should send an e-mail outlining your research interest and 
motivations, including; (a) your C.V. (please list publications and experimental skills) & 
(b) contact details and e-mail addresses for 3 referees to: Dr. Charles Spillane, Genetics 
& Biotechnology Lab, Biochemistry Dept & Biosciences Institute, University College 
Cork, Cork, Ireland. E-mail: c.spillane@ucc.ie
Deadline: June 16th 2008 (or until suitable applicant is recruited).
