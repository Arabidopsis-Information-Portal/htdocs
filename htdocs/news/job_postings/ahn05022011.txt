A post-doctoral position available in miRNA biogenesis studies in
Arabidopsis.
Creative Research Initiative, Korea University, Seoul, Korea


A postdoctoral researcher position is available starting immediately (or
starting within next three months) to study the small RNA-mediated
regulation of flowering time by ambient temperature at Korea University,
Seoul, Korea. This is full-time (3-year) grant-funded positions
(Creative Research Initiative in Korea). We are very interested in how
the rate of miRNA biogenesis is controlled by different temperatures in
Arabidopsis. A Ph.D. degree in plant miRNA, small RNA, or a related
field is required. Candidates should be highly motivated and are
expected to perform independent research. Experience in protein-RNA
interaction, protein-protein interaction, and NMR will be expected. A
strong background in molecular biology/biochemistry is a plus.
Successful applicants will be expected to show a high degree of research
productivity, good communication skills (both oral and written), and an
ability to work collaboratively with other lab members. Starting salary
will be commensurate with previous experience of the applicant.
