Vol 01S: <h2>BUSINESS SESSION</h2><p>

On the Business session, held on Saturday, April 24, 1965, the
following matters were discussed: 1) the form and content of future
issues of the newsletter "Arabidopsis Information Service", 2) the
cooperation in the maintenance of natural races and mutants, 3) the
coordination of the description of mutants and symbolization and
mapping of their genes, and 4) the nomenclature of "chlorophyll
mutants".<p>

ad 1) As to the "Arabidopsis Information Service" all participants in
the discussion expressed their general consent with the present
procedure of publications. To better the difficulties of its
financiation REDEI mentioned the possibility that either the authors
should pay for their contribution in "AIS" or a Society could be
founded, the membership fees of which might balance the publication
costs. On the other hand FEENSTRA and others preferred charging more
from non-contributors.  GICHNER suggested the alternative yearly to
change the Institute realizing the production of the issue, the
Editor, however, being the same. The most agreement was given to the
view of ROBBELEN to overcome the financial problems by personal
contacts to all persons and institutions interested in Arabidopsis
research to contribute according to their pecuniary situation. The
majority of those present thought it preferable to keep Gottingen
constant as place of this publication.<p>

ad 2) Some organisation for the preservation of all known Arabidopsis
races and mutants was considered useful and necessary. The
"LAIBACH-sortiment" maintained at present by ROBBELEN in GOTTINGEN,
consists of 150 types some of which differ only slightly. Till now
only small number of these was used for experimental designs.
Therefore the question arose whether it is necessary to save all the
numbers or to reduce the collection to the more important ones.
RATCLIFFE showed extreme interest in all of these "non-selected" races
and offered his support in keeping a duplicate of the total collection
in his laboratory at the Scottish Plant Breeding Station,
Pentlandfield. ROBBELEN proposed for the "LAIBACH races", maintained
by the various research workers at different places to compare them
with the original stocks in Gottingen, in order to reveal eventual
genetic deviations caused by spontaneous mutation, selection or
various mistakes: for this purpose he asked everyone to send him the
seeds. FEENSTRA recommended to workers with similar research projects
to use identical races.<p>

For the maintenance of mutants REINHOLZ pointed to the idea that all
workers send their mutants to a central place where identity tests
with the existing genotypes are made by hybridization and the new
mutants kept. Because of the large number of existing mutants this, of
course, is not feasible. Therefore FEENSTRA, Van der VEEN and others
considered it obligatory for everyone to keep alive the mutants and
genes which he has described or worked with. Good genotypes and marker
genes identified and/or mapped could be propagated and held available
at a cental institute, for instance in Wageningen.  The possibility to
survive definite genotypes unchanged by prolonging the seed
germinability, e.g., by storage in evacuated glass-tubes, was
indicated by SCHWANITZ.<p>

ad 3) For standardization of gene symbolization and mutant description
MULLER repeated his proposals (published in Arabid. Inf.  Serv., 1,
38-39, 1964) recommending the rules of the "International Committee of
Gene Symbols and Nomenclature" (Un. In. Sci. Biol. Ser.  B.  30, 1-6,
1957). Accordingly genes and symbols are only valid for described,
localized and existing mutants! If two earlier described and noted
mutants later prove to be identical or if two authors independently
use the same name of different mutants a commission should be
responsible for the arrangement of a new symbolization. If no identity
test was carried out, the mutant only should be named but not
symbolized. Mutants no longer available should be striken out from the
list of mutants.<p>

Linkage data were held necessary by REDEI as a presupposition for the
denotation of new mutants. Of chief importance should not be the name,
but the symbol which should not be longer than two letters.  REDEI
offered the following markers from his material as a standard for such
mapping experiments:<p>

Linkage Group:<p>

ad 4) For the classification and nomenclature of leaf colour mutants
of Arabidopsis the systems of LAMPRECHT (cf. this report p.  208- 209)
was generally accepted. Special stress was laid by ROBBELEN on the
arrangement to place the whole xantha-group as lethals, while all
viable yellowish types should be termed chlorina or similar. For a
reproducible description of colour shades the comparison with some
international colour standards was advised, e.g.,: R. RIDGEWAY: Color
Standards and Color Nomenclature, Washington 1912<p>

E. BIESALSKI: Pflanzenfarben-Atlas. Gottingen: Musterschmidt-verlag
1957.<p>

Vol 01S:</a> <h2>Classification System of Leaf Colour Mutants</h2>

(after H. LAMPRECHT: Agri hort. Genet. 18, 135, 1960)
<pre>
I. Chlorovegetus	fully vital in all respects (wild type)

 A. Chloroaequalis	all usually green parts of plant with same colour
	flavoviridis			yellow-green
	flavoviridis subobscuris	a little darker yellow-green
	claroviridis			yellowish green
	clavoviridis obscuris		darker yellowish green
	viridis				medium green
	viridis subcoeruleus		bluish green
	viridissimus			bluish deep green

 B. Chloroinaequalis 	certain usually green parts of the plant with
			deviating colour due to gene effects

II. Chlorodefectio	chlorophyll deficiencies with vitality and
 			fertility more or less reduced, some lethal
			(mutant)

 A. Chlorohom		on-coloured, evenly distributed deficiency
 			apparent from the beginning and persisting
			during the whole life time of plant

	albina		pure white, lethal (alb)
	xantha		pale yellow, lethal (xa)
	lutea		straw-yellow, lethal (lut)
	aurea		golden or orange, rare, lethal (au)
			Foregoing pure yellow mutants all lethal,
			the remaining, which contain mor or less
			chlorophyll, are lethal, sublethal or only
			reduced in vitality.
	chlorina	pale dull green-yellow,	frequent (ch)
	chloretica	light dull green-yellow, more chlorophyll or less
			carotenoids than chlorina (chi)
	flavoviridis	yellow-green, only difficult 			
			to discern from chlorina, though more green, but not
			at all pale green like chlorotica, higher vitality
 			than the both forementioned types (flavi)
	viridalba	greenish white, lethal (vial)
	claroviridis	bright green, usually fully vital (clavi)
	viridissimus	dark green, forest green, fully vital (vrid)
			The following mutants are characterized by
		 	a grayish shade		
	argentea	silver gray, semivital (arge)
	caneovirens	light grayish green, lethal (cavi)
	griseovirens	grayish green (grivi) glauca
			dark bluish green, semivital (glau)
	coeruleovirens	deep bluish gray-green,	semilethal (cov)
	olivacae	oil green (oli)
	fuscus		brown, mostly as component of chlorodiv (fus)

The following three subgroups of mutants are characterized exclusively
by combinations of the forementioned colours

 B. Chlorodiv		at least two-coloured

	a. maculata	colours distributed in spots
		albino-(luteao, chlorina etc) masculata	spots
			of the respective colour with distinct
			borderlines on green leaves (almae)
		vario-maculata	spots of different
			colours, irregular in form and size
 			and unevenly distributed, not
			distinctly delimited from surrounding tissue
		vario-micro-maculata like the
			foregoing but very small, densely
			and evenly distributed spots
		spurio-maculata	two colours interspersed 		
			in irregular pattern
	b. striata	longitudinal stripes
	c. transvirgata	transverse stripes
	d. basalis	leaf basis deviating
	e. apicalis	leaf tip deviating
	f. marginata	leaf margin deviating,
 			covering the total leaf
			margin = totomarginata
	g. costata		leaf nerves deviating
		chlorotica-viridis-costata
			ground-colour chlorotica, nerves
			green
		chlorina-costata-diffundere
			yellowish colour of nerves
			spreading towards intercoastal areas

Designation of parts of plant deviating in colour are given by
compositions, e.g., cot-flavoviridis-apicalis=yellowish stalk

C. Chloromut		changing colour during development of plant
	a. virido-emergere	seedlings normally
			green, change of colour during later
			development of plant
		albescens	green turning albina	 (albs)
		xanthescens	  "   "  xantha	 (xas)
		lutescens	  "   "  lutea   (luts)
		aurescens   "   "  aurea   (aus)
		chlorescens  "   "  chlorina  (chs)
		chlorotescens "   "  chlorotica (chis)
	b. aegroro-emergere seedlings at germination
		chlorophyll-deficient, the first name
		designating the colour at germination,
		virescens, lut (ea)-chlorescens or more
		complicated: chlorotica-virido-
		maculata-virescens = mutant, which
		emerges chlorotica, then small
		enlarging green spots and finally evenly
		green

D. Chlorofract	sudden change of colour at a
		certain stage of development, designated
		by the name of the newly developing
		colour followed by the word terminalis,
 		e.g., albina-terminalis		(alt)
		      aurea-terminalis		(aut)
