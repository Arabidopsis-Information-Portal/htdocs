Dr Angela Hay is looking for a post-doctoral researcher to join her group in
the Plant Sciences Dept at the University of Oxford. The project aims to
determine the genetic basis of divergence in floral structure between the
model species Arabidopsis thaliana and its close relative Cardamine hirsuta.
The research will involve developmental genetics and QTL analysis to uncover
the genomic regions underlying both induced and natural variation in C.
hirsuta floral structure. The post is available from 1 November 2007.
Further particulars are available on http://www.plants.ox.ac.uk/  Informal
enquires to angela.hay@plants.ox.ac.uk.
