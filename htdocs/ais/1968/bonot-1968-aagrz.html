In a previous work (JACOBS and BONOTTO, 1967) we have studied the
incorporation of labelled 5-bromodeoxyuridine (3H-BUdR) into the DNA
of Arabidopsis, in different experimental conditions.  It was found
that a significant amount of radioactivity is incorporated by the
plants when the base analogue is applied to the axils and even more
when it is added to the culture medium.  Moreover, the results
obtained with aminoptrin and FUdR, two inhibitors of pyrimidine
synthesis, suggested that BUdR can replace thymidine even in the
presence of a normal pool of thymidilate. The results reported by
BROWN (1967) seem to be in accord with this hypothesis.  In fact, BUdR
applied to the axils of the plants, suppressed temporarily the
incorporation of 3H-thymidine, leading without any doubt to the
formation of an BUdR-substituted DNA.  This abnormal DNA may lead to
the formation in the cells of abnormal proteins by the intermediary of
modified m-RNA molecules (JACOBS, 1978) and consequently to the
appearance of particular phenotypes, as chlorophyll mutants (JACOBS,
1964) or laggard plants (BROWN, BHATIA, and SMITH, 1965; JACOBS,
1967).<p>

The possibility remains, however, that Arabidopsis, like bacteria,
possesses some biochemical systems capable to restore the abnormal
DNA, by excision of the analogue, or by removing the halogen from the
analogue (HESLOT, 1966).  In order to check this later possibility we
have examined the DNA of Arabidopsis, Wil-2, for the presence of Br by
neutron activation analysis, a technique which permits to measure
extemely low amounts of the halogen (KIRCHMANN, 1960).  Preliminary
results obtained by this technique, have shown that the DNA extracted
from plants cultivated in presence of BUdR, contains a significant
amount of Br.  The DNA of the controls does not contain the halogen.
These results enable us to the following conclusion: The BUdR is
incorporated into the DNA and remains unchanged in the macromolecule.
We cannot exclude, however, that in some particular physiological
conditions or for some races of Arabidopsis, a biochemical mechanism
restores the abnormal DNA.  In this case no mutants will be expected.
Detailed information about the extraction and the neutron activation
analysis of Arabidopsis DNA will be reported in a further paper.<p>
