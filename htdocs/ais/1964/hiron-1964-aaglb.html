Vol 01:<h2>HIRONO, Y.</h2><h2>Effect of plant age on pigment content of chlorophyll b deficient mutants</h2>

The chlorophyll content per fresh weight of wild type and two ch
mutnts (ch1 and ch2) of different ages were measured.  The plants
cultured in pots were exposed to sunlight during the day and
illuminated with 200-watt incadescent bulbs during the night (December
- January).  In the greenhouse the temperature ranges were about
20*degrees* - 30*degrees*C.<p>

For chlorophyll analysis whole plants without root and flower were
used.  The results are shown in the Table.  The amount of chlorophyll
per fresh weight is higher in the younger stage than in the old stage.<p>

The pigment content was measured by the technique of ROBBELEN (1957a).
*This small amount is not considered as real evidence for the presence
of the pigment and it is rather an unavoidable error of this kind of
technique.<p>
