<h1>1997 Gordon Research Conference on Plant Cell Genetics and Development</h1>
<hr>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Gordon Research Conference on Plant Cell Genetics and Development
(PCG&amp;D) is a conference now held in alternate years with the Plant Molecular
Biology conference. The last PCG&amp;D conference was held June 1995 and
the program emphasized studies of apical meristem and primordia. Last year's
Plant Molecular Biology conference, July 1996, included sessions on gene
silencing, light signaling, plant hormone action, plant disease resistance,
etc. The upcoming PCG&amp;D conference will be held June 1997 at New England
College in Henniker, New Hampshire. Although the program will cover a broad
range of subjects on plant genetics, it will highlight the importance of
synteny of plant genomes on our understanding of gene architecture and function.
