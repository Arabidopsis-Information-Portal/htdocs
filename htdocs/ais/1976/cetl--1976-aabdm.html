Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. appears to be a reliable experimental
object for studying the population structure of predominantly
self-pollinating plan species (CETL, and PLCHOVA, 1975; CETL, in
press).  Conclusions from experimental data can be done only by means
of a theoretical model taking into account the three main features of
populations of Arabidopsis: (1) the low proportion of random crossing;
(2) effective selection pressures against homozygotes; (3) the
condition of balanced polymorphism for some loci in equilibrium
populations.<p>

One locus, A, with two alleles, A1 and A2, is assumed to exist in a
large population of a completely autogamous plant species. The two
alleles are present in the population at gene frequencies p and q,
constituting the A1A1, A1A2, and A2A2 genotypes in genotypic
frequencies P, H, and Q, respectively.  A permanent zygotic selection
pressure against the two homozygotes is expressed by corresponding
adaptive values w1 and w2, w1 being a measure of selection against
A1A1, and w2 of selection against A2A2, if w1, w2<1.<p>

Under complete autogamy the genotypic frequencies in the t-th
generation as compared with the foregoing generation, t-1, will be
following:<p>

Thus the equilibrium genotypic frequency of heterozygoe, H, is
dependent only on the adaptive values of the two homozygotes,
irrespectively of other circimstances, for example of initial gene or
genotypic frequencies.  It is easy to prove that in either cae of
"symmetry" and "lethality" the deciding condition of attaining
equilibrium at H>O is that w1, w2<.5 (cf. HAYMAN, 1953)<p>

The formulae given in (3) do not describe new facts as compared with
earlier papers (HAYMAN, 1953; WORKMAN and JAIN 1966) but they are very
easy to use for rather practical purposes.  It is clear that the
formula (iii) appears to be most general, and all others can be
derived from it.<p>

More complicated formulae should be constructed for the equilibrium
frequency of heterozygotes if complete autogamy will change into a
common presence of autogamy and crossing the proportions a and c,
respectively.  Naturally, a + c = 1.  WORKMAN and JAIN (1966)
demonstrated equations which must be satisfied at equilibrium using
the fixation index F (WRIGHT, 1965) expressing the joint effect of
inbreeding and selection.<p>

Here three equations (4) to (6) will be given enabling us to calculate
the equilibrium frequency of heterozygotes, H, succesively by
determining the fixation index at equilibrium, F, the equilibrium gene
frequency, p, and finally the equilibrium genotypic frequency of
heterozygotes, H:<p>

It may be easily proved according to the equations (4) to (6) that the
larger the proportion of crossing, the higher the upper limit of
adaptive values of w1 and w2 under which balanced polymorphism is
possible.<p>

The meaning of this theoretical model is to be used mainly in
considerations about equilibrium genotypic frequencies and adaptive
values.<p>
