Postdoctoral Research Associate Position in Breeding and Biotechnology of Biofuel 
Crops

Position is available for postdoctoral research associate in the Laboratory of Plant 
Molecular Physiology, Agronomy Department, IFAS, University of Florida.

Lignocellulosic materials produced by biomass grasses are a promising feedstock to 
produce low-cost ethanol. Our research program integrates traditional plant breeding, 
mutagenesis, advanced genetic transformation technology and functional genomics to 
identify, isolate and engineer limiting factors for improvement of grasses

Postdoctoral research will focus on both, the genetic improvement and the reduction of 
invasiveness, of the biofuel crop elephantgrass. Research will involve the comparison of 
traditional breeding, interspecific hybridization, chemical mutagenesis and transgenic 
approaches. This is an ideal opportunity for meaningful publications and future 
professional development in either academia or industry.

Excellent communication skills and publications demonstrating expertise in a range of 
traditional breeding and molecular techniques are required for the postdoctoral position.

Annual starting salary is $ 30,000 plus benefits.
