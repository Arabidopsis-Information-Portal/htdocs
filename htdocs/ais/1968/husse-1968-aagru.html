The very early variety "erecta", which is an X-ray mutant from
Landsberg (by REDEI), flowers after 22-25 days with 6-7 rosette
leaves. From this 'line C', an EMS mutant was derived by BHATIA and
Van Der VEEN (1964), which flowers 5-6 days later and has 6-7 more
rosette leaves.  This 'line 51', has now been found to differ from
'line C' in a single partially recessive gene. After seed
vernalization, 'line 51' (e1e1) closely resembles 'line C' (E1E1),
which does not respond (HUSSEIN and Van Der VEEN, 1965).  Both lines
were subjected to large scale selection experiments after EMS-or X-ray
treatments.  No selections earlier than line C could be obtained. This
is in accordance with BHATIA and Van Der VEEN (1964).<p>

The following groups of mutants were obtained.  All these mutants were
identified as single gene mutants, but tests of linkage or allelism
have been only done within groups (A, B, etc.).  It should be noted
that only fully fertile and vigorous mutant lines were selected, and
that these were only crossed after M5:<p>

(A) Late mutants with large effect, i.e., flowering at least 10 days
later and having at least 10 rosette leaves more than the parent of
origin: These are 3 about completely recessive EMS-mutants (e2e2 from
line C; e4e4 and e6e6 from line 51) and 1 EMS-mutant with an
intermediate heterozygote (e3e3, from line 51).  A 6 x 6 F2-diallel
(and backcrosses), including lines C and 51, showed that all mutant
genes are at different loci and only E3-e3 and E4-e4 are rather
closely linked.  It is interesting to note that these latter two
mutants show relatively little response to seed-vernalization, and
show the same type of genotype-season interaction.  All other mutants
mentioned in this paper (except l3l3; see later) give complete or
nearly complete response to vernalization.<p>

(B) Late mutants with relatively small effect from line C: These are 3
partially or about completely recessive EMS-mutants (l1l1, l2l2, l3l3),  and 3
partially dominant or nearly completely dominant X-ray mutants X1X1,
X2X2, X3X3).  A 7 x 7 F2-diallel closely linked, and that L3L3 is
probably loosely linked to these two.<p>

(C) Late mutants with relatively small effect from line 51: In this
group we have 1 partially recessive EMS-mutant (e8e8) and 1 completely
recessive X-ray mutant (e7e7).  These two loci are probably closely
linked, but no linkage to E1-e1 could be detected.<p>

(D) Early mutants from line 51: None of these is as early as line C.
These are 4 partially or almost completely recessive EMS-mutants
(v1v1, v2v2, v3v3, v4v4) and 2 partially recessive X-ray mutants
(v5v5, v6v6.  A 7 x 7 F2-diallel (including line C) revealed that, of
these loci, V6-v6 is either very closely linked to E1-e1, or v6 is a
third allele (e1) at the E1-e1 locus.<p>

(E) A second-cycle selection programme (after EMS- or X-ray treatment)
was started with one late mutant from line C (viz., e2e2).  Of the 2
early EMS-mutants obtained, one (R1R1) is dominant towards early and
has a relatively small effect, the other (R2R2) shows an intermediate
heterozygote and has a large effect (halfway between line C and e2e2).
R1-r1 and R2-r2 are linked to each other but not linked to E2-e2.  It
should be noted that R1 is the only dominant EMS-mutation (which in
this case is towards early).<p>

One of the main objectives of this study was to identify single gene
segregations and linkage relationships for a character which often
appears to show typical quantitative inheritance.  Further details can
be found elsewhere (HUSSEIN, H.A.S., Ph.D. thesis, Wageningen, in
preparation).<p>
