Postdoc position at University of Oxford

Applications are invited for a 1-year postdoctoral position in the Hay lab 
to study explosive pod shatter in Cardamine hirsuta. The position is 
available immediately and the starting date is negotiable. The successful 
candidate will use state-of-the-art high-speed image analysis to 
characterize pod shatter in C. hirsuta. This empirical data will be used to 
generate dynamic models of explosive pod shatter in collaboration with 
researchers from the Flight Dynamics and Control Group in Zoology, the 
Fluidics and Biocomplexity Group in Engineering, and the Centre for 
Mathematical Biology here at Oxford. Proven research skills and expertise in 
plant biology or a related field are essential, and the ability to work 
creatively, co-operatively and independently, as part of a multidisciplinary 
team is highly desirable. Further particulars may be downloaded from 
http://www.plants.ox.ac.uk and are also available from the Administrator. 
Informal enquiries about the project can be directed to 
angela.hay@plants.ox.ac.uk. 

Applications including curriculum vitae, name and contact details of two 
referees and quoting post reference no. AP10016 are to be sent to the 
Administrator at the Department of Plant Sciences, University of Oxford, 
South Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3RB or by email to recruit@plants.ox.ac.uk. The
