In the course of investigation of various biological actions of
diverse kinds of ionizing radiations on higher plants the experiments
were carried out in which the effectiveness of fast neutrons relative
to X-rays in inducing root growth inhibition ("Keimwurzeltest" by
MULLER, 1964) in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.)  HEYNH., race Enkheim, was
estimated.  Seed irradiation and dosimetry were carried out by the
staff of Ausenstelle des IfB im ZfK-Rosendorf.  Neutron beam was
obtained at Y-120 cyclotron (D-Be reaction, average LET about 30-35
kev per micron, dose rate about 6 kRad per hr).  Parameters of
X-irradiation were as follows: I=20 mA, U=245 V, filter 1 mm Cu + 2 mm
Al, dose rate about 6 kRad per hr.<p>

Five experiments were carried out each consisting of at least a
hundred root measurements per treatment.  The obtained data in percent
of respective control values are tabulated below.<p>

Crude estimation of relative effectiveness of the radiations applied
has shown that the fast neutrons were by about an order of magnitude
more effective than the X-rays.  This RBE value is in good agreement
with respective data obtained by other authors for biological actions
of similar radiations on higher plants.<p>
