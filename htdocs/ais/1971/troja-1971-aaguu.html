<h2> The genetic behaviour of families derived from one natural population</h2><p>

Our earlier studies with natural populations of Arabidopsis thaliana
(L.) HEYNH. were based on mixed samples of seeds from 25 to 100 plants
growing in one locality (CETL, DOBROVOLNA, and EFFMERTOVA, 1969).  In
the present paper another method of sampling was used in a relatively
early flowering population Mo-4: the seeds from individual plants at
the same locality were harvested individually (cf. NAPP-zinn, 1964;
JONES, 1968).  In 25 families sampled in this way the number of days
to appearance of the flower primordia and other developmental
characters were studied in successive generations under laboratory
conditions (CETL, RELICHOVA-DOBROVOLNA, and KRSKOVA, 1970).<p>

Three characteristic examples of results obtained with these families
and their individual subfamilies (4 to 10 plants of each family were
taken for the study of one subfamily) are given in the Figure.  The
families Nos. 4 and 8 were uniform and this uniformity also recurred
in their subfamilies.  On the opposite, the family No. 20 can serve as
an example of a relatively non-uniform family with clearly variable
subfamilies.  Among all 25 families studied, about a quarter was found
to be of this non-uniform type. Few transitional cases were also
present between the two extreme types of families.  In this way, it
seems to be possible to determine the proportion of uniform
(+homozygous?) and of non-uniform (=heterozygous?) plants present in a
natural population.  At present, later generations of this material
are studied, and corresponding analyses of variance are underway.<p>
