     Clint Chapple (Purdue University, West Lafayette) outlined
what is known about the biosynthesis of lignin and some aspects
of the role of lignin in controlling the quality of wood.  He
noted that many of the reactions involved in lignin formation are
catalyzed by cytochrome P450s, a large family of related enzymes
that have been largely recalcitrant to conventional biochemical
characterization in plants.  However, more than 70 Arabidopsis
ESTs with homology to cytochrome p450s are now available from the
Michigan and French EST projects and work is underway to assign
function to at least some of these.  He went on to describe the
cloning by T-DNA tagging of a cytochrome P450 gene that
corresponds to ferulate-5-hydroxylase.  The mutant lacking this
activity is deficient in syringyl lignin.  He suggested that
expression of the cloned gene in softwood species such as poplar
may improve the hardness of the wood and, thereby, expand the
uses for this abundant but underutilized source of biomaterial.

Christoph Benning (Institute fur Genbiologische Forschung,
Berlin) described progress toward understanding the biosynthesis
and function of specific lipids.  By screening several thousand
lipid extracts from a mutagenized population by TLC
chromatography, his laboratory identified a mutant that is
deficient in the chloroplast-specific lipid
digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGD).  Surprisingly, this mutant is
viable but shows various alterations in the organization of
chloroplast membranes.  Also surprising was the observation that
the mutant appears to have normal activity for all of the enzymes
proposed to be involved in DGD synthesis.  The mutant has,
therefore, provided an impetus for the formulation of a new
pathway for the synthesis of DGD and possibly other chloroplast
lipids.  He also described progress towards identifying genes
involved in the synthesis of sulfolipid.  This lipid is one of
the most abundant sulfur-containing organic molecules but only
one step in the pathway of synthesis is known. Members of his lab
have cloned many of the genes for sulfolipid synthesis from a
purple bacterium and a cyanobacterium. They have used sequence
information from these genes to identify a homologous sequence in
a rice EST.  This will facilitate a test of the role of
sulfolipid by the production of transgenic Arabidopsis plants
expressing an antisense version of the corresponding Arabidopsis
gene.

 Bertrand Lemieux (York University, Toronto) described
progress in the isolation of genes controlling the synthesis and
deposition of epicuticular wax.  In collaboration with Ken
Feldman, at least five cer genes have been tagged with TDNA.  The
genes for two of these, cer2 and cer3 have been isolated and
characterized.  Both genes encode novel proteins of unknown
function.  Thus, although it seems likely that these genes encode
enzymes involved in wax biosynthesis additional work will be
required to assign function.

 Chistiane Nawrath (University of Fribourg, Fribourg)
summarized experiments concerning the production of biodegradable
thermoplastics in plants.  The polymer, polyhydroxybutyrate
(PHB), is synthesized in three steps from acetyl-CoA.  High
levels of production of PHB in transgenic plants was obtained by
restructuring three genes from the bacterium Alcaligenes
eutrophus so that the gene products were imported into
chloroplasts. Trihybrid plants containing all three genes
accumulated more than 14% of the dry weight as granules of PHB
without exhibiting any obviously deleterious effects on growth. 
On the basis of these experiments it appears likely that PHB and
related polymers can be produced at economically feasible levels
in agricultural species.

 Tod Richmond (University of Wisconsin, Madison) gave a short
talk describing a pleiotropic T-DNA mutation that causes aberrant
floral morphology and sterility among other things.  Oddly, the
mutation appears to inactive a tetrafunctional protein involved
in beta-oxidation of fatty acids.  There is no apparent
explanation as to how beta-oxidation and morphogenesis could be
causally related.

Jyan-chyun Jang (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston)
presented a short talk describing the isolation of mutants that
are either hypersensitive or insensitive to exogenous sugars and
summarized evidence from antisense experiments showing that
hexokinase is involved in the phenomenon of sugar sensing.
