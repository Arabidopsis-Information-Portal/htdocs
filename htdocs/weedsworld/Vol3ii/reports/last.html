<H1>Session 10: Biochemical Genetics</H1>
<H4>Chair: Chris Somerville<br>
Summary: Rob Last, Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research at Cornell
University, USA.</H4>

<HR>Although the Biochemical Genetics session covered many biochemical processes, the theme of sensing and responding to environmental and internal stimuli
ran through many of the talks. This is an interesting area of plant biology
given that plants grow under and adapt to a wide variety of climatic conditions. 
<p>
<A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Norwich/sessions/S92.html" target="_top">Rob Last</A>, of the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research at Cornell began the session by describing his group's genetic
dissection of oxidative stress. This is an important topic because plants
experience oxidative stress caused by normal metabolic processes and during
growth under extreme environmental conditions, and plant pathogenesis. Last and coworkers are using the air pollutant ozone as a convenient way to increase
reactive oxygen species in <I>Arabidopsis</I>. In published work, they and
Keith Davis' lab at Ohio State University have shown that <I>Arabidopsis</I>
induces rapid changes in gene expression following ozone fumigation. More
recently, Patricia Conklin in Last's group has identified ozone sensitive
mutants that are deficient in L-ascorbic acid (Vitamin C). These plants,
which still have 1 millimolar concentrations of ascorbate, are sensitive
to a variety of abiotic stress conditions including sulfur dioxide and UV-B.
They also show altered responses to pathogens. Future studies with these
mutants should reveal the ascorbate biosynthetic pathway in plants (which
is still not known despite its importance in human nutrition), and will
tell us more about the role of this abundant antioxidant in physiological processes and cell division.
<p>
As photosynthetic creatures, sugar metabolism and regulation of genetic
and biochemical processes in response to carbohydrate status are near and
dear to the hearts of plants. Several talks described approaches to the
dissection of sugar sensing mechanisms using genetics and reverse genetics. 
By using reverse genetics, <A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Norwich/sessions/S94.html" target="_top">Jen Sheen's</A> group at Massachussets General Hospital
has built upon published work from her lab and others to obtain strong evidence
that the enzyme hexokinase acts as a sugar sensor in higher plants. <A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Norwich/sessions/S93.html" target="_top">Jyan-Chyun
Jang</A> presented data showing results with transgenic plants that overexpress or underexpress hexokinase. Analysis of seedling
phenotype and expression of genes whose regulation is known to be influenced
by sugar showed that overexpresser plants are sugar hypersensitive and antisense
transgenic plants are relatively insensitive. Because the regulatory activity
of yeast hexokinase is thought to require its catalytic activity, Jang tested
the effects of the fungal enzyme in <I>Arabidopsis</I>: overexpressing yeast
hexokinase confered elevated <I>HXK</I> activity but did not affect sugar sensitivity in transgenic plants, implying the
catalytic but not the regulatory functions of <I>HXK </I>are shared between
plants and yeast. Based on these results, Sheen's group propose that <I>Arabidopsis</I>
hexokinase has both catalytic and regulatory functions that are not completely overlapping.
<p>
Two groups reported using sugar sensitivity of seedlings as a way to identify
mutants that may be altered in carbohydrate sensing and response. To complement
and extend their work with transgenic plant, Jen Sheen' s lab has obtained
several classes of glucose insensitive (<I>gin</I>) mutants. These mutants show altered responses to glucose at both biochemical and molecular
levels. <A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Norwich/sessions/S96.html" target="_top">Ian Graham's</A> group in Glasgow has taken advantage of the observation
that seedlings accumulate high levels of anthocyanins and low levels of
chlorophyll in their hypocotyl and cotyledons on agar medium 
containing high sucrose (100 mM) and depleted nitrate. They have used these
growth conditions to obtain a number of <I>cai</I> (<I>carbohydrate insensitive</I>)
mutants that do not accumulate high levels of anthocyanins yet still have
significant levels of chlorophyll. The characterization of <I>cai</I> and
<I>gin</I> 
mutants should help to define upstream sensing mechanisms and downstream
pathways in sugar signal transduction. 
<p>
Large-scale genomic DNA sequencing promises to revolutionize all aspects
of plant biology, and biochemical genetics is no exception. One glimpse
of this brave new world was provided by <A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Norwich/sessions/S95.html" target="_top">Alain Lecharny</A> from CNRS, Universite
Paris-Sud. Free arabinose and galactose, possibly released during the degradation
or turn over of polysaccharides, can be metabolised along a salvage pathway
starting with a sugar kinase to form a sugar-1-phosphate and then by a second
enzyme to produce the UDP-sugar. As part of the ESSA (European Scientists
Sequencing Arabidopsis) project, Lecharny and<BR>
coworkers discovered a galactokinase family member near the <I>FCA</I> locus.
They identified two ESTs with homolgy to this putative sugar sensing protein.
The smaller one (496 aa) maps to chromosome 3 and complements the <I>E.
coli galK</I> galactokinase structural gene mutation, suggesting that this
may be a galactokinase cDNA. In contrast, the gene on chromosome 4, which
encodes a protein of twice the size and with less similarity to the <I>galK</I>
cDNA, maps very near to the arabinose hypersensitivity mutation <I>ara1</I>.
This mutation was discovered by Chris Cobbett's group at the University
of Melbourne, where it was shown to cause an arabinose kinase deficiency.
The working hypothesis of the Lecharny/Cobbett collaborators is that the
<I>galK</I> homologue 
discovered by genomic sequencing encodes the arabinose kinase affected in
<I>ara1</I>.
<p>
Although the most of the inorganic nutrients plants require are available
in abundance, not all are easily accessible.<A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Norwich/sessions/S97.html" target="_top"> Mary Lou Guerinot</A> (Dartmouth
University) described molecular and genetic approaches to dissecting the
processes that plants use to acquire iron from the soil. When iron is 
limiting, <I>Arabidopsis</I> roots show three responses that make iron more
available to the plant: increased Fe(III) chelate reductase activity, increased
Fe(II) transport and increased acidification of the rhizosphere. Mutants
that have altered Fe(III) chelate reductase activities have been 
isolated and characterized and the mutations have been mapped in anticipation
of walking to the genes. To approach Fe(II) transport, they took advantage
of what is known about iron transport in yeast. The <I>IRT1</I> (iron-regulated
transporter) gene, encoding a probable Fe(II) transporter, 
was cloned by functional expression of an <I>Arabidopsis</I> cDNA in a yeast
strain defective for iron uptake. Yeast expressing <I>IRT1</I> possess a
novel Fe(II) uptake activity. <I>IRT1</I> is predicted to be an integral
membrane protein with a metal-binding domain. In <I>Arabidopsis</I>, <I>IRT1</I>
is expressed in 
roots and is induced within 24 hours after transfer of plants to iron deficient
growth conditions. Database comparisons and genomic Southern blot analysis
indicated that <I>IRT1</I> is a member of a gene family in <I>Arabidopsis</I>.
Interestingly, related sequences are also found in the genomes of rice,
yeast, nematodes, and humans. In yeast, two of the<I>IRT</I>-related genes,
<I>ZRT1</I> and <I>ZRT2</I>, encode high affinity and low affinity zinc
transporters, respectively. Using a <I>zrt1;zrt2</I> yeast strain defective 
in zinc uptake, they have isolated several <I>Arabidopsis</I> genes that
functional studies in yeast suggest may encode zinc transporters. Understanding
the amino acid residues that determine ion specificity may allow creation
of designer metal transport systems in plants.
<p>
Mark Knight of Oxford University described an approach to studying a process
that may be common to the various signaling processes described above. Intracellular
calcium acts as a second messenger in <I>Arabidopsis</I> transducing many
signals including changes in temperature, mechanical 
stimulation, oxidative stress and circadian rhythms. Knight and his colleagues
measure intracellular calcium non-invasively in living plants by expressing
the calcium activated photoprotein, aequorin, in transgenic <I>Arabidopsis</I>.
This allows the measurement of cytosolic free calcium in real time by measuring
luminescence. A recent advancement is that they have targeted aequorin to
various organelles and membranes to measure calcium fluxes at specific locations
of the cell. This approach is being bolstered by identifying mutants showing
altered calcium dynamics.
<p>
Participants were reminded of the interesting results being obtained in
plant cellular biochemisty during a talk from Alex Conceicao of Natasha
Raikhel's group at Michigan State University. Syntaxin and its homologues
are membrane proteins involved in docking and/or fusion of transport 
vesicles. Recently the <I>aPEP12</I> gene, encoding a syntaxin homologue, was cloned
from <I>Arabidopsis</I> plants (Bassham <I>et al.</I>, 1995, PNAS 92, 7262-7266).
This plant gene product is proposed to play an important role in protein
targeting because the yeast protein is involved in protein trafficking to 
yeast vacuoles, and may be associated with a prevacuolar organelle (Becherer
<I>et al</I>., 1996, Mol. Biol. Cell 7, 579-594). Conceicao showed that
the <I>Arabidopsis <I></I>PEP12</I> protein (aPEP12p) is present either as one
or two major isoforms depending on the tissue. Several subcellular fractionation 
techniques indicate that both aPEP12p isoforms are localized to the same
organelle. Furthermore, immunocytochemical studies of seeds showed that
aPEP12p is present on the membranes of smooth-vesicles; they are grouped
to form multivesicular bodies which could correspond to endocytic or prevacuolar
organelles. Prevacuoles have not been biochemically characterized in plants
and aPEP12p could be a first membrane marker of this organelle type.
