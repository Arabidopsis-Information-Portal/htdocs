After the isolation of the nitrate reductase-less mutant B25, which we
presented earlier (Braaksma and Feenstra, 1975; Feenstra and Braaksma,
1976) another promising mutant, (isolation number) B73, has been
isolated. Like our other mutants with defective nitrate reduction, B73
has been isolated by screening for chlorate resistance. The
characteristics of the mutant B73: 1) chlorate resistant; 2) grows
poorly on a medium with nitrate as sole nitrogen source, on such a
medium the plants stay very small and light green; 3) the nitrate
reductase (NAR) activity is low, about 10% comlpared with that of the
wildtype; 4) nitrate uptake is enhanced compared with the wildtype, so
that the low NAR activity is not caused by the absence of substrate
for the induction; 5) the mutation is monogenic and recessive.<p>

These features are very similar to those of the mutant B25, though in
B25 the expression may be more explicit: chlorate resistance is
clearer, growth on a nitrate medium is poorer, NAR activity is lower.
Complementation tests and linkage studies revealed that the mutations
of B25 and B73 concern different genes.<p>

In fungi functionating nitrate reductase probably consists of a
multimere of one or two molecules having cytochrome c (cyt c)
reductase activity together with a Mo-containing cofactor (Macdonald
et al., 1974; Coddington, 1976). This may also be the case with higher
plants (Mendel and Muller, 1978). Therefore we studied cyt c reductase
of the wildtype, B25 and B73. Under certain "high level" conditions
cyt c reductase activity of the wildtype can be 3-5 times higher than
that of plants grown on an ammonium medium, which generally show the
lowest activity. Under these "high level" conditions NAR activity is
5-8 times higher than that of ammonium grown plants. For B25, the
level of ammonium grown plants was about the same as for the wildtype,
but under "high level" conditions the cyt c reductase activity was
only about 60% compared with the wildtype. For B73, the level of cyt c
reductase was about the same as for the wildtype under all conditions.
The relationship between NAR and cyt c reductase was further
investigated using sucrose gradient centrifugation. Wray and Filner
(1970) showed that on sucrose gradients in barley two types cyt c
reductase can be separated with sedimentation values of approximately
8S and 4S. The heavy 8S species is known to represent NAR. In our
sucrose gradient two types could be separated in wildtype extracts,
and the heavy type coinsides with NAR activity. In ammonium grown
plants, where NAR activity is very low, most of the cyt c reductase
sediments as the light type and only a small part is of the heavy
type. But "high level" conditions, inducing high NAR activity, give a
different picture: the large part of cyt c reductase sediments as the
heavy type, only a relatively small amount is of the light type. The
results with B25 are different: also under "high level" conditions the
heavy type is almost completely absent, all cyt c reductase sediments
as the light type. This is not the case with B73 under "high level"
conditions: a large part of cyt c reductase sediments as the heavy
type, though the NAR activity is very low. The remaining amount of
light type ct c reductase in this mutant is relatively large compared
with the wildtype.<p>

From these results it can be concluded that B25 is unable to form the
heavy type cyt c reductase and therefore has no NAR. Though B73 is
able to produce the NAR associated heavy type cyt c reductase, it
exhibits very little nitrate reductase activity. This mutant might
have a defect in the cooperation with the cofactor.<p>

The results of some other experiments are in agreement with the later
conclusion. In bacteria (Glaser and Demoss, 1971; Hartingsveldt and
Stouthamer, 1973), fungi (see Coddington, 1976) and the higher plant
Nicotiania tabacum (Mendel and Muller, 1976) mutants are found, which,
next to being nitrate reductase-less, are deficient in the production
of xanthinedhydrogenase (XDH). From these data the conclusion was
drawn that the enzymes concerned have the cofactor in common. The
growth of some of the mutants could be partially restored by a 100 to
1000-fold increase of the molybdenun concentration of the substrate.<p>

The XDH-activity of germinating seeds of our mutants was measured by a
method for the determination of the XDH-activity of Drosophila, given
by Barret and Davidson (1975). Based on seed weight, the activity of
mutant B25, after 3 days germination was 59% and the activity of B73
was 16% of that of the wildtype. After 8 days germination both mutants
were devoid of any activity, whereas the activity of wildtype had
increased to 166% of the value at 3 days.<p>

Both a 100- and 1000-fold increase in the Mo-concentration had a
normalizing effect on mutant B73, but not on mutant B25. Growth of the
former mutant with No3 as the sole nitrogen source improved and NAR
activity after growth on NH4 NO3 and the highest Mo-concentration was
enhanced to 50% of the wildtype activity. Determination of the
Mo-content of wildtype and mutant B73 gave no indication that the
latter is blocked in the uptake of Mo. We therefore draw the
conclusion that in mutant B73 the cofactor is defective, presumably in
its interaction with Mo.<p>

The nature of the lesion in mutant B25 is less obvious. Seeds which
have germinated for 8 days lack XDH activity, suggesting that the
cofactor is absent. However, 10 days old seedlings also lack NAR
associated cyt c reductase activity. MacDonald et al. (1974) suggested
that the cofactor is assembled with subunits, showing cytochrome c
reductase, into a complex showing NAR activity as well. Possibly, in
mutant B25 lack of a functional cofactor presents the formation of NAR
and the associated cytochrome c reductase. Alternatively, some
regulatory mechanism may control both the level of cofactor production
and that of high weight cytochrome c reductase activity.<p>
