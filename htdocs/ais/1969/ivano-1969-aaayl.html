It is a well known fact that the processes of seed soaking and
germination are usually accompanied by an increase in general
radiosensitivity.  Our experiments, the results of which are briefly
summarized below, were carried out in order to compare the influence
of seed soaking on various biological actions of irradiation on
Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) HEYNH.<p>

In preliminary experiments with seeds of the race Enkheim it was found
that under room conditions the process of water uptake by seeds takes
about 6 hrs, and that mass seed germination happened about 48 hours
from the beginning of soaking.  As it is difficult to obtain more or
less synchronous seed populations at the critical points of the
soaking curve, only dormant, soaking, and presoaked seeds (0, 3, and
24 hrs of soaking, respectively) were subjected to 60 Co
gamma-irradiation (doses: 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 kR, dose rate
about 200 kR/hr).  The influence of seed soaking on the increase in
radiation induced seeding lethality, inhibition of vegetative and
reproductive growth and sterility of plants was studied in usual test
tube culture.  Ten independent replicate experiments, each including
twenty plants per treatment, were carried out.  The obtained data were
subjected to anovar and rank correlation analysis.<p>

On the basis of the response to soaking the studied effects of
irradiation may be crudely classified in the following way: (I) those
affected already by 3 hrs soaking, this group includes the cotyledon
stage lethality, the frequency of completely sterile plants among
survivors, and the mean number of seeds per fertile plant; (II) those
affected only by 24 hrs soaking, this group includes the rosette stage
and total lethality, the mean root length at the 7th day of the plant
growth, and the fraction of seedlings, which formed the rosettes
within the 1st week of experiment, and (III) those unaffected by
soaking - the fraction of plants which formed the inflorescences
within three weeks of experiment, and the duration of the life cycle.
It may be seen from this classification that (a) in the respect of
decreasing susceptibility to soaking the studied effects of radiation
may be ordered as follows: induced sterility - lethal effects - growth
inhibition, and (b) within the groups of characters, corresponding to
lethality and growth inhibition the influence of seed soaking is lower
for the effects of irradiation registered at the later stages of plant
growth.<p>

Rank correlation analysis of the data revealed the following: (I) a
close correlation between the cotyledon stage lethality and
practically all the other characters corresponding to lethal and
growth inhibition actions of radiation, (II) a close correlation
between the frequency of sterile plants and the decrease in the mean
number of seeds per fertile plant, (III) some particular correlations
within the group of characters corresponding to lethality and growth
inhibition, and (IV) no correlation between the characters
corresponding to induced plant steriltiy, on the one hand, and all the
other characters corresponding to the lethality and growth inhibition,
on the other hand.<p>

A comparative consideration of the presented data suggests a diverse
nature and complex interrelationship between the multiple biological
actions of radiations on higher plants.  In this respect certain
particularities in the manifestation of radiation induced plant
sterility seem to be especially interesting.  A more detailed
description and discussion of the above presented data will be
published elsewhere.<p>
