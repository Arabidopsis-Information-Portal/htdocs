It has been recently reported about the high efficiency of the new
chemical mutagen N-nitrosomethylbiuret (NMB,I) inducing mutations in
insects, fungi and microorganisms. At our request Dr. I.A. RAPPOPORT
has kindly given us the opportunity to investigate the effects of NMB
in plants.<p>

Air dried seeds of the race Enkheim of Arabidopsis thaliana were
soaked in solutions of the mutagen of different concentrations 16, 32,
63, 125, 250, 500, 1000 and 2000 microM during 18 hours oat t = +
20+/-0.5*degrees*C (pH=5.9).  The action of the mutagen was terminated
by washing the seeds in tap water. The plants were grown in the soil
in boxes of the mountain station Sieh-Kuh.  In M1 we estimated the
somatic and in the embryo stage of the seed development the genetic
effects by many parameters (Table 1).<p>

Table 1: The effects of N-nitrosomethylbiuret on the frequency of
recessive embryonic mutations in A. thaliana.<p>

In order to evaluate the mutagen eficiency of NMB it has been compared
to the effects of N-nitrosomethylbiuret (NMU).<p>

In figure 1 curves are shown indicating the differences in the rate of
sterility in M1-plants after treating the seeds by NMU and HMB
(similar experimental conditions).  The point of curvature at 75
p.c.-rate of sterility is corresponding to 350 microM NMU
concentration, and for NMB approximately 1000 microM. For these
different concentrations (but similar in inducing the sterility) the
values have been found by the graphs.<p>

They characterize the mutability and the frequency of plants with
chemomorphosis in p.c.:<p>

Such a comparison quite clearly shows the priority of NMB in the
induction of mutations.  NMB induces less of the sterile plants
(Figure 1) and plants with chemomorphosis and this indicates its lower
toxicity than NMU.<p>

concentrations of NMU (1) and NMB (2).  The rate of sterility has been
estimated according to MULLER (1964).<p>
