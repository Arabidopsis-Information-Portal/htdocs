Postdoctoral position at University of Tennessee]

A postdoctoral position is available to carry out research on ERECTA
receptor like kinase signaling in Arabidopsis. ERECTA and its homologues
ERL1, and ERL2 synergistically regulate coordinated cell proliferation
(Shpak et al., 2004 Development 131, p1491-1501 ) and are important for
cell fate specification and stomatal patterning (Shpak et al., 2005
Science 309, p290-293) The project involves identification of new
components in ERECTA signaling pathway and analysis of
posttranscriptional regulation of ERECTA expression. Applicants with
strong experience in molecular biology, biochemistry and cell biology
are encouraged to apply. Experience with Arabidopsis is helpful, but not
required. Extensive experience with RNA purification and analysis will
be an advantage. This position is available, initially, for 2 years. To
apply, send a cover letter describing your interests, CV, as well as
names and contact information of three references to eshpak@utk.edu.
