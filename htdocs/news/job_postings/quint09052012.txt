The Leibniz Institute of Plant Biochemistry (IPB), Germany, invites 
applications to fill the positions of 
a Postdoc and a Ph.D. student. 

We are looking for creative, flexible, and enthusiastic new team members 
with a Masters/Ph.D. degree in Biology, Biochemistry, or Agriculture (or 
equivalent) to join the our Research Group in the Department of Molecular 
Signal Processing at the IPB. The phd student and the postdoctoral 
researcher will investigate signaling mechanisms plants utilize to adapt to 
abiotic stress. The Quint Lab is generally interested in signaling pathways 
-- especially those triggered by phytohormones - that shape plant 
development. We follow a variety of approaches including molecular biology, 
molecular genetics, population and quantitative genetics, 
genomics/transcriptomics, and evolutionary biology. Deadline for submission 
of applications is Sep 23, 2012. Please send applications (reference number 
15/2012 for phd student and 17/2012 for postdoc) including the usual 
documents and contacts of two references as a single pdf by email to 
bewerbungen@ipb-halle.de. The positions are available from Jan 1, 2013 or 
upon agreement. For further information, see http://quintlab.openwetware.**
