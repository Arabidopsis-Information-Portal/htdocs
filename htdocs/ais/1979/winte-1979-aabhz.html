There exist several hints to connections between the metabolism of
phenylpropane derivatives on the one hand, and the metabolism of
growth substances on the other, which, for their part, may control
certain developmental phenomena (cf. e.g., Galton, 1969; Nitsch, 1972;
Letouze, 1978). Under this point of view we studied the pattern of
phenylpropane derivatives in three genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana,
differing from each other in developmental characters, at different
phases of development, under qualitative and quantitative aspects. The
following genotypes were used: 1) the early summer annual strain
Hannoversch Munden (Hm) the seeds of which require after ripening and
light for germination (Kugler, 1950), 2) the early summer annual
strain Limburg-5 (Li-5) the seeds of which need neither postmaturation
nor light (cf., e.g., Napp-Zinn, 1957), 3) the winter annual mutant
Florens (F) that occurred in the experiments of McKelvie (1962).<p>

The plants were grown in a greenhouse during spring and summer under
natural long day conditions. Samples were harvested every tenth day
after sowing. The phenylpropane derivatives were extracted by boiling
water, separated by column chromatography and thin layer
chromatography, and identified by spectral photometry, thin layer
chromatography and hydrolysis respectively.<p>

The results may be summarized as follows: In all genotypes studied we
found altogether 1) five sinapic acid esters, ii) one complex in which
ferulic acid, sinapic acid and p-coumaric acid are involved, iii) one
scopeletin glycoside which does not yet seem to be known from any
other cruciferous plant (cf. Gibbs, 1974), iv) five quercetin
glycosides with different degrees of glycosidation, v) four kaempferol
triosides, vi) one kaempferol tetroside, and vii) one not exactly
identified substance, probably a methoxylated monoside.<p>

Isorhamnetin that is regarded as main component in Cruciferae
(Harborne, 1967), could not be found in Arabidopsis; it may be
replaced by the unknown substance at the end of the preceding list.<p>

A fundamental shift of this pattern occurs during germination; while
quercetin glycosides (one monoside, one bioside, and two triosides)
predominate in the resting seed, kaempferol glycosides prevail in the
seedling. The transition to flowering is not accompanied by any change
of this kind in any genotype. The pattern of hydroxycinnamic acid
derivatives, in general, did not show any clear relation to
ontogenesis.<p>

The only remarkable difference between genotypes is the presence of
two substances in the race Hm, which are absent from the others. One
of these substances, a quercetin glycoside, only occurred in seedlings
10 days after sowing; the other one, a kaempferol glycoside, was not
found in resting seeds, but in all later phases of development. It
does not seem very likely that these two substances could have
anything to do with the special requirements of this race with regard
to germination.<p>
