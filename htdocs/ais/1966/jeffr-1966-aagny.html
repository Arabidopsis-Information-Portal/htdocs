	Low levels of radiation produced by the radioisotopes strontium-90 and cesium-137 in the culture medium and incorporated into the plant have initiated early flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) HEYNH. race Estland.  The plants were grown in aseptic test tube culture in continuous illumination at a temperature of 78+/-2*degrees*F.  The isotopes were added to the medium in concentrations of 1 microCurie and 10 microCurie per plant.  Control plants were grown in media containing stable strontium or no isotope of either element.  The plants grown in 10 microCurie of strontium-90 or cesium-137 flowered earlier than those grown in the 1 microCurie concentration or in any of the control treatments.<p>

	An experiment is now being carried out with plants growing in 20 microCurie of strontium-90 which indicates that 10 microCurie gives maximum stimulation of flowering.  Another experiment in which the absolute concentration of strontium is constant but the activities are again 1 microCurie and 10 microCurie shows that the stimulatory effect is due to radiation rather than isotope effect since the plants in the more active medium are flowering earlier.  Studies on the distribution of these isotopes also indicate that the stimulatory effect is due to radiation and is not an isotopic effect.<p>

	The distributions of strontium-90 and cesium-137 differ in the plant. Strontium-90, like calcium, remains in the older parts of the plant, the rosette, the primary shoot and first flowers.  On the other hand, cesium-137 is redistributed to the growing parts of the plant like potassium.  The distribution of the isotopes was determined by counting and by autoradiography.  Relatively more isotope was taken up by the plants grown in 1 microCurie activity.<p>

	The seeds of these plants given various treatments will be grown to determine the genetic effects of the incorprated radioisotopes and chronic exposure to low level radiation in the M1 generation.<p>

	The graph compares the flowering time of plants grown in 1 microCurie and 10 microCurie per plant of strontium-90 with plants grown in equivalent concentrations of strontium-88.  The criterion for induction of flowering was the "1-cm shoot" given by MULLER (1961) which is the time that the shoot rises one cm above the rosette.<p>
