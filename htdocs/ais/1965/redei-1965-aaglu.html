Vol 01S: <h2>Genetic Control of Subcellular Differentiation</h2><p>

G. P. REDEI<p>

Problems of gene action have interested geneticists from the very
beginning (cf. ZIRKLE, 1950). In the early days of mendelian genetics
BATESON and PUNNETT (1905) believed that their work on higher plants
and animals was an experimental approach to the study of the
physiology of heredity. Real understanding of the role of genes in
metabolisms targeted, however, only when gene action moved from the
discussion to the experimental part of the papers (BEADLE and TATUM,
1941). Since then rapid developments in microbial genetics have
overshadowed even Drosphila genetics. Recently even the "central
dogma" has become amenable to direct experimental approach with
studies penetrating deeply the subcellular realm of biology. In spite
of these great advances in genetic knowledge, relatively little is
understood about the action of genes controlling differentiation,
organization, development, and growth. These problems are primarily a
challenge to geneticists of higher organisms. Because of the
complexity involved a general experimental attack on these mechanisms
is very difficult.<p>

A recessive mutant of Arabidopsis, im (REDEI, 1963 a, b) which had a
facultative ability of chloroplastid formation appeared as a promising
tool for studies of a simple cae of differentiation.<p>

Under greenhouse conditions, at moderate temperature, seed homozygous
for the im mutation germinated with predominantly green cotyledons.
Many of the cells were non-pigmented. In the rosette leaves large
white areas included well demarcated green sectors of various size.
Individual cells within each sector were either normal green or white
without intermediate shades.<p>

The pattern of variegation generally followed the direction of leaf
differentiation. Sometimes the cell lineage reproduced consistently
green or white cells in parallel rows. Occasionally almost all green
or white leaves were observed with very few, if any, patches. Due to
the characteristic way of differentiation of the stem leaves the
reversibility of green-white changes could be readily studied. It was
clear that a certain number of cells started multiplying as green,
then shifted to white and repeated this several times in an
oscillatory manner (Figure 1). The pattern was definitely not random;
rather it appeared that one kind of cell reproduced<p>

Figure 1: Typical stem leaf. White and green tissues developed in
alternate sequence.<p>

phenotypically similar cell progenies for a good number of divisions
then shifted suddenly to the other phenotype to produce copies of that
type for a number of mitoses. This behaviour was not limited to single
cell lineages but appeared synchronous in neighboring cells. The
dashed line of green on a white background demonstrates this quite
clearly (Figure 1).<p>

The variegation was observed also on the stem and on the
inflorescence. The siliques were generally sectorial. This apparently
reversible type of gene action has made it possible to study the
genetics of the two kinds of sectors.<p>

The seed harvested from all green or all white fruits produced
indistinguishable progeny. Variegation was limited to the homozygous
recessive condition. Close linkage with another chromosomal factor
(vc2) was established. Transmission of im through the female and the
male was identical. It was obvious therefore that both phenotypes of
the cells were due to the same simple mendelian factor. The
differences were not caused by mutability of a single gene, or by
sorting out of cytoplasmic hereditary units.<p>

Variegation may be caused also by some other genetic mechanisms.
Infections origin of this condition is very remote since it is not
transmitted mechanically either by rubbing, injection, or insects.
Position effect of the V-type may have similar consequences (cf.
LEWIS, 1950). Small transpositions can not be detectd cytologically in
Arabidopsis. In plants V-type position effect must be very rare; it
has been reported only in Oenothera (CATCHESIDE, 1947).  The
physiological basis of variegation induced by heterochromatin is not
understood (cf.  HARTMANN and SUSKIND, 1965). Variegation type
position effect should not cause any change in the gene itself; it
affects only the activity of the unchanged by transposed locus (cf.
GRUNEBERG, 1937).<p>

Attempts were made to change the im mutant by rearranging the
chromosome just as did GRIFFIN (1941) with Drosphila using
x-irradiation. Permanent changes have not been obtained so far.<p>

However, irradiation did have a remarkable effect on the phenotype. In
five experiments the number of seedlings emerging with green
cotyledons was slightly but consistently higher in the irradiated
group (Table 1). Somewhat more plants developed larger green sectors
in the rosette leaves. In the irradiated group, the number of plants
with green stem was three times that in the control, a difference
statistically significant.<p>

Table 1: Effect of x-rays on the greening of the cotyledons of mutant
im<p>

This information indicates that in the white sectors something is
actively suppressing normal plastid formation and that irradiation
apparently inactivates this metabolic suppressor produced by the im
locus.<p>

The question arose as to what step of the gene action is blocked.
Since further mutation at the im locus was not observed, DNA
replication is probably normal. The first logical step was to study
some end products of the gene. Since the phytochrome system controls
at least 30 morphogenetic responses, including plastid differentiation
and chlorophyll synthesis (cf. GORDON, 1964), the effect of light on
the mutant was studied. The im mutation did not change the
photoperiodic response of the plants, but short daily illumination and
low light intensity suppressed somewhat the variegation and favoured
normal differentiation as measured by leaf pigment determination
(Table 2).<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol01S/vol01S-pg121-tab2.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

Table 2: Differences depending on the length of the daily illumination
(20*degrees*C)<p>

The effect of light was temperature dependent. Temperatures higher
than ca. 28*degres*C interfered with greening even under inductive
illumination. At those higher temperatures the total of eight hours
daily illumination was more conducive to greening if given in one hour
cycles. The response of im mutant to certain spectral regions was
characteristic. Blue and green light promoted greening; the red and
yellow parts of the spectrum had the opposite effect (Table 3). This
result is somewhat unexpected since the operation of a red far-red
absorbing system was anticipated. It may be noted, however, that
photoperiodism is also under the control of a blue far-red system for
Arabidopsis MEIER, 1959)<p>

Only colored cellophane filters were used; therefore, far red was not
excluded from either the blue or red. Since radiant energy
measurements were not made, this information is of limited value. It
has been reported earlier (REDEI, 1963 a) that the two sulfhydril
amino acids, cysteine and homocysteine, had inverse effects on the
variegation. Cysteine promoted greening; homocysteine suppressed
normal plastid formation. The cysteine effect was further increased by
blue light and was almost nullified by the predominantly red part of
the spectrum. The inhibitory effect of homocysteine was released by
blue light (Table 5). Thus it appears that the light overrode the
effect of these thiol compounds.<p>

Table 7: Effect of 6-azauracil on pigment production of mutant im
(cotyledon, stem excluded, 23 days old culture, non-slanted agar)<p>

The mechanism by which these amino acids affect Arabidopsis cells is
not known. It is interesting to note that cysteine inhibits amphibian
development and another thiol, s-mercaptoethanol, has a similar effect
on some animal eggs or on Acetabularia plants (cf.  BRACHET, 1964).
The inhibition caused by s-mercaptoethanol was brought about by a
boosted nucleic acid synthesis which resulted in the production of an
apparently abnormal protein (cf. BRACHET, 1964).<p>

Preliminary expriments with some antibiotics which inhibit protein
synthesis (chloramphenicol, streptomycin, puromycin) showed that thse
agents did not affect appreciably the im induced variegation.
Similarly D-alanine, a very efficient competitive growth inhibitor
9REDEI, 1964) had practically no influence on pigment production
(Table 6).<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol01S/vol01S-pg124-tab6.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

Table 6: Effect of the enantiomorphs of alanine on mutant im<p>

Acridine orange which removes episomic elements from bacteria (HIROTA,
1960) did not give unnambiguous results indicating that higher doses
interfered with leaf pigment production. Methylene blue, a
photodynamic bactriophage inactivating agent (YAMAMOTO, 1958), did not
specifically affect the im mutant.<p>

Phenethyl alcohol, which blocks reversibly DNA and mRNA synthesis
(BERRAH and KONETZKA, 1962; ROSENKRANZ et al., 1964), did not change
the variegation. The im induced sectoring was unaffected by
aminopterin, an inhibitor of the conversion of deoxyuridine to
thymidine (cf. FERIEDKIN and KORNBERG, 1957). The pyrimidine analogs
bromo-deoxycytidine (cf.  BROCKMANN and ANDERSON, 1963) and the purine
analogs 2-amino purine, thioguanine, 8-aza-adenine (cf. HITCHINGS and
ELION, 1963) were tested on im in various concentrations but all
failed to affect the variegation.<p>

Striking suppression of the variegation was observed in 6- azauracil
or 6-azauridine fed cultures (Table 7). Besides partially restoring
pigment production, azauracil proved to be an efficient inhibitor of
plant growth. In the presence of these compounds leaf development was
abnormal. Flowering was delayed; the length of the hypocotyls was
considerably reduced, etc. Because of this last mentioned effect the
rosette leaves generally came in contact with the agar medium and
consequently the azauracil treated plants grew larger than the
control. On slanted agar the difference was eliminated. By gently
tapping the test tubes after germination, the untreated control plants
were also caused to fall on the agar. This increased the size and
weight of the controls without an augmentation of the pigment content.<p>

Azauracil is a competitive inhibitor of crotidylic acid decarboxylase
(Figure 2) in normal and leukemic animal cells (HANDSCHUHMACHER, 1960;
BONO et al., 1964) and in cocklebur leaf discs (ROSS, 1964). Thus de
novo pyrimidine synthesis is blocked while uridylic acid incorporation
at the expense of the cytoplasmic pool is not halted. This is likely
to be the case in Arabidopsis since uracil completely releases
azauracil inhibition. It should be remembered that 6-aza-thymine does
not suppress the im controlled variegation thus the target of
azauracil is probably an RNA fraction. KALOUSEK et al.  (1962)
reported that 6-azauridine-5'-diphosphate inhibited the formation of
the pCpCpA sequence in the transfer RNA<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol01S/vol01S-pg125-fig2.gif">Click here for figure</a><p>

Figure 2: Scheme of azauracil inhibition of de novo pyrimidine
synthesis. Azauracil is converted to azauridine which, when
phosphorylated, successively competes for the active site of
orotidylic acid decarboxylase and consequently uridylic acid synthesis
is halted (C02 is not produced either).<p>

It may be noted tht amethopterin, a folic acid analog, increased the
number of non-Stubble bristles in Drosphila heterozygous for a
rearrangement causing V-type position effect (SCHULTZ, 1956).  This
effect was attributed to the interference with DNA synthesis by
blocking methylation of uridine and by impeding the production of
purines. It seems more likely, however, that inhibition of RNA
synthesis was responsible for the phenotypic observations caused by
the analog.<p>

At the present time not much direct evidence is available on how the
inhibition of the pyrimidine synthesis affects the realization of the
variegation. Some preliminary data suggest that in the predominantly
white im mutants, RNAase activity is higher.<p>

Summary: It appears that the im controlled variegation is caused by an
unstable suppressor of gene action. Mutation of im is apparently not
concerned primarily with a structural gene but rather with a
regulatory factor since normal plastid formation may take place in
homozygotes under appropriate conditions. It is suspected that a
mechanism which normally keeps in check the transcription of a coding
unit is out of order.<p>

Discussion:<p>

NAPP-ZINN: I should like to ask, whether you have tested the identity
of this mutant, of which you have spoken, with the mutant v1 of
McKELVIE, which is exactly the same phenotype.<p>

REDEI: No, I did not. Some variegation mutants may be allelic to this
one. The mutant, shown by Dr. ROBBELEN in his exhibition outside the
door may be the same.<p>

BROWN: My question is, whether you got some seeds of this mutant
especialy on the white sectors?<p>

REDEI: Those plants which are entirely white, do not yield seed.  But
you can get seeds from plants, which were exposed to
short-day-treatment and became green. When exposed to higher intensity
of light for two-three weeks white fruits may be obtained.  The
progeny of those all-white fruits may be tested.<p>

ROBBELEN: How did you test the ribonuclease activities, in the
isolated chloroplasts or in the whole cells?<p>

REDEI: I did not test isolated chloroplasts. I extracted the enzyme
with acetate buffer from disrupted whole cells and after incubation at
pH 6.5 with yeast RNA I measured the O.D. at 260 nm (S.R.  DICKMAN et
al.: Biochem. biophys. Acta 21, 539, 1956)<p>

JACOBS: Do you have some data on the cystein content of the mutant?<p>

REDEI: No. But I think that it is normal.<p>

LANGRIDGE: I would like to ask about the possibility of inducing
similar effects with analogues of guanine.<p>

REDEI: I tested some guanine analogues. But they did not have any
specific effect. Actually these base analogues which I tested should
be RNA analogues. But they all did not have any specific effect. I
used thio-uracil which is a very effective growth inhibitor.  The
plants stay white in any concentration. The azauracil effect is not a
general inhibition, but a very specific one. We do not understand the
mechanism.  It can not be expected to block a specific messenger with
a pyrmidine inhibitor, but actually, mainly one function was effected
in the used concentration range.<p>

LANGRIDGE: Did you use thymine analogues?<p>

REDEI: I tried thymine analogues also (e.g., azathymine), but they did
not do anything.<p>

BONOTTO: Do you have any idea about the localization of the
incorporated analogues?<p>

REDEI: No!<p>

BROWN: Have you studied the effect of UV light?<p>

REDEI: No. This should not be very effective, since penetration will
not be very high.<p>
