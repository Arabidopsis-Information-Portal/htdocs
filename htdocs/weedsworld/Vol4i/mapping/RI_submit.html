<center><H1>RI data submission form - Instructions</H1></center>
<hr>
The following RI data submission forms have been designed to make it easier to enter data obtained from RI mapping experiments. They are currently available in two flavours, one which is designed to use advanced features of Netscape 3.0 and other newer browsers, and one which is compatible with all other forms-capable browsers (I hope!). If you have problems with any of the forms for data entry please contact me at <a href="mailto:RI_data@thale.life.nottingham.ac.uk">RI_data@thale.life.nottingham.ac.uk</a>. Pressing the "Start Data Entry" button at the end of this document will automatically send you the correct entry form.
<hr>
Please read the following instructions <font color=RED>CAREFULLY</font> before continuing.<p>
The Netscape 3.0 version takes you through several pages of information and questions, basically so that Locus names can be validated before any data entry has taken place. On older browsers this is much more difficult to program, and because of this there is no validation of locus names until we run the mapmaker program. Please check the existing locus names carefully before deciding on what to call your locus, this makes life easier for all of us. The form for other browsers is one page, and has no validations. You will be notified by email that we have received the submission, and the results of the mapping will be sent out as soon as possible after receiving your data.
<hr>
On the data entry forms you will be presented with a series of input boxes. There are items that are required on these forms so that we can inform you of the results of the mapping. You must supply valid entries for these fields, otherwise we cannot send you the results of the mapping. The Form will not be submitted until there are entries in these fields, and any ommissions will be indicated on an error page. There then follows a comments box and a box for the locus name. The locus name is required and MUST take the form :<p>
<menu><menu>*LOCUS_NAME</menu></menu>
<p>
The asterix preceeding the locus name is required, and on the enhanced version of the form ommission of this will be detected. The locus name itself must NOT exceed eight characters - INCLUDING the asterix. 
<p>
On the enhanced version of the form, you will also have to select the number of lines you have scored (either 20, 30 or 100), after which you will be required to submit the data entered so far, and any errors in the entry will be brought to your attention.The next page is a data entry screen for the RI data. Simply select the score appropriate for each line and press the submit button. The final screen allows you to check the data you have entered before finally submitting the data to NASC. If at any stage up to this you find errors in the data simply press the BACK button and correct the errors. If you are satisfied with the data, print a copy of the data for your own records. Press SUBMIT on this page and the data will be submitted to the database of RI mapping data at NASC, it is not sent to us prior to this, so it is important that you press the SUBMIT button on this page, otherwise we will not receive any data from you.<p>
Please do not select the BACK button to correct any mistakes after the data has been submitted, this will only result in confusion in the data entry. If you find errors in the data after submitting the data, send an email message to <a href="mailto:RI_data@thale.life.nottingham.ac.uk">RI_data@thale.life.nottingham.ac.uk</a> stating what the problem is and we will correct it manually.<p>
For users of older browsers, enter the RI data in the table which follows the locus name field by selecting the option button appropriate to your score for each of the RI lines you have data for. Please check the data before you submit the form, there is no second chances with this version of the form. Once you are satisfied with the data, submit the data, and we will include it in the next mapping run. 
<p>
 If you receive an error page, select the BACK option from the pull-down menu associated with either the right mouse button (WINDOWS and UNIX) or holding the mouse button down (MAC) and correct the data.
