AIS Vol 02:<h2>Influence of glucose feeding on the free amino acid content of chlorophyll mutants</h2><p>

In previous papers (VELEMINSKY et al. 1963, 1965) it was reported,
that an abnormal accumulation of amids and basic amino acids like
lysine, arginine and histidine was found in lethal chlorophyll mutants
growing on soil in the greenhouse.  It was postulated that this
accumulation is a consequence of proteolysis after the energy store of
seeds gets exhausted.  Using the chlorina mutant (No. 42), which does
not normalize on an agar medium containing 2% glucose, the correctness
of this hypothesis was confirmed: No greater accumulation of amids and
basic amino acids, mentioned in comparison to green control plants,
was observed under these feeding conditions.<p>
