The present-day ecological situation is characterized by the presence
of mutagens and carcinogens in the environment many of which have
become permanent or long-duration components of the biosphere. In this
context, the problem of anti-mutagenesis is gaining a particular
importance.<p>

Until recently antimutagenesis of higher plants was studied on a
chromosome level (Welsh onion, aegilops, beans, hawk's beard, wheat)
(Alekperov, 1982)<p>

In this paper the first results are reported on using Arabidopsis
thaliana as a test object to analyse the effect of antimutagens on
induced mutations in higher plants. The experiments included
irradiating both control and experimental seeds of A. thaliana race
Enkheim with gamma rays at a dose of 500, 300, 100 and 50 Gray
followed by treating experimental seeds with aqueous enotannin
solution at a concentration of 1 x 10E-3 micro g/ml for 18 hours. The
seeds were then placed in test tubes containing agarized mineral
medium and planted at permanent illumination and a temperature of 24
+/- 1*degree*C. Unripe pods of A. thaliana were analysed using embryo
test by Muller for the presence of chlorophyll mutations (Muller,
1961).<p>

The investigation results are summarized in Table 1.<p>

Table 1: Effect of ennotannin on the level of induced mutations in
Arabidopsis thaliana<p>

It is seen from Table 1 that the level of induced mutations correlates
well with irradiation dose for both control and experiment species.
The share of mutated plants varies between 3.9 +/- 2.24% for 50 Gray
and 27.4 +/- 4.33 for 500 Gray.<p>

The use of enotannin resulted in a considerable reduction of mutation
plants at any irradiation dose.<p>

It appears that due to the well known advantages of A. thaliana which
made this plant, among some others, most adequate for investigating
gene mutations, it can be used in another direction of modern
genetics, namely in antimutagenesis.<p>
