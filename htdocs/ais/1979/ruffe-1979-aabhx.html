The investigations reported here in a summarized form had a threefold
intention.<p>

Firstly, although the earliest anatomical investigations of plant
hybrids were performed about 90 years ago (R.v. Wettstein, 1887a, b,
1889; Brandza, 1890 a, b, c; Macfarlane 1892) our knowledge about the
basis of the genetics of anatomical structures is remarkably poor even
today.<p>

Secondly, though Arabidopsis thaliana has become one of the standard
examples of higher plants in the fields of genetics and developmental
physiology one can only find incomplete and disconnected information
about the anatomical variations of this plant (see Napp-Zinn, 1973,
1974 and the earlier literature cited therein).<p>

A third reason for this investigation was, that a comparison between
fasciated lines of Arabidopsis (f2 f2 clv1 clv1, f5 f5 clv1 clv1) and
the corresponding normal types had shown that the fasciated plant
developed many more leaves than the plant showing normal growth,
whereas the difference between the total dry weight of leaf mass was
negligible (Krickhahn and Napp-Zinn, 1975). This raised the question
of whether the smallness of the leaves of the fasciated plants might
be in any way correlated with a small number of cells or a reduced
cell volume.<p>

Considering those aspects it seemed worthwhile to invesigate different
genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana with respect to a comparison of the
anatomical stucture of their leaves. We chose for other investigations
examples of the following lines:<p>

1) the slightly late blossoming mutants f2 f2 + + and f5 f5 + +
(McKelvie, 1962) and the lines f2 f2 clv1 clv1 and f5 f5 clv1 clv1
(see Krickhahn and Napp-Zinn, 1975) which were the results of a
crossing with the mutant + + clv 1 clv1 (McKelvie, 1962).<p>

2) the early summer-annual standard line Enkheim-1 (En-1; see
Robbelen, 1965),<p>

3) the early blossoming dwarf-growth and leaf from mutants F 105 and F
79 (derived from an Enkheim-line) which were a generous gift from Dr.
Kranz in 1976,<p>

4) four glabrous lines, the smoothness of which derives in all cases
from the gene gla of the line Wilna-2 (Wil-2; see Napp-Zinn, 1963).
One line had only this marker gene (gla gla + +), the other three
possessed the gene ax (McKelvie, 1962) in a homozygous condition as
well (gla gla ax ax); in one of those three lines the gene Fri
(Napp-Zinn, 1957) deriving from the line Stockholm (St) caused late
blossoming.<p>

The plants were raised in a growth chamber at 20*degrees*C and under
continuous illumination (OSRAM-65 W universal white fluorescent lamps,
9000 - 10000 lux ). The average age of blossoming of the different
genoytpes is shown in Table 1. As a rule the investigations concerned
the 3rd, 5th, 7th and 10th rosette leaves and in several cases the lst
for leaves of the main shoot with respect to:<p>

i) the number of epidermis cells per mn2, the number of stomata per
mn2,<p>

ii) the somatal index (after Salisbury, 1927, see Napp-Zinn, 1973, p.
250, the average surface area of the epidermis cells,<p>

iii) the number of hairs per cm2<p>

iv) the structure of the mesophyll, and<p>

v) the length of the vascular bundles per leaf and per cm2.<p>

The first four criteria were determined as follows: for the rosette
leaves 3 areas, each of 0.2 mn2, from the middle of the leaf blades,
sufficiently far from the edge and the middle vein, of 4 individuals,
that is 2.4 mn2 for upper and lower surface were counted with the help
of "Uhu-hart" replicae. On the stem leaves only one 0.1 mn2 area per
upper and lower surface of 5 individuals, altogether 0.5 mn2 for each
genotype, were investigated. To give an example, on the 5th rosette
leaf the number of epidermal cells per mn2 varies, depending on the
genotype, between 238 and 520 for the upper leaf surface and between
246 and 626 for the lower surface; the number of stomata varies
between 85 and 173 per mn2 for the upper surface and 87 and 191 per
mn2 for the lower surface (the lowest values were all found in the f2
f2 clv1 clv1 genotype the highest values mostly in gla gla ax ax Fri
Fri). The stomatal indices differ much less (between 22.6 and 27.6 for
the upper surface, and between 21.7 and 26.1 for the lower surface).
It is surprising that the epidermis of the smaller leaves of the
fasciated plants (f2 f2 clf1 clv1 f5 f5 clv1 clv1) showed bigger cells
than the (bigger) leaves of the corresponding normal forms (f2 f2 + +,
f5 f5 + +).<p>

Table 1: Arabidopsis thaliana. Number of stomata and 'ordinary'
epidermal cells (including subsidiary cells) pr mn2 and stomatal
indices of the 5th rosette leaf of 10 genotypes. The symbols (+) and
(*) mark the extent of the statistical significance of differences in
comparison with the standard line En-1 (first line)<p>

The unicellular, most branched hairs of the 7 hairy genotypes were
counted, for each type, on 10 upper and lower epidermal areas, each of
the size of 0.5 or 0.25 cm2. The areas were taken from the middle part
of 20 large full grown rosette leaves. The mean values were calculated
for 1 cm2 leaf area as well as for the whole leaf area; the latter was
determined gravimetrically with the help of cut out leaf photocopies.
Here one could see that F 79 had the smallest leaves (about 0.5 cm2)
and the smallest number of hairs per leaf surface, that is 110 on the
upper and 11 on the lower surface. The highest values were found for
f2 f2 ++: 4.39 cm2 leaf area with 611 hairs on the upper surface and
365 on the lower surface. The number of hairs per cm2 on the upper
surface was between 62 (f5 f5 clv1 clv1) and 210 (F79), on the lower
surface between 24 (F79) and 81 (f2 f2 ++); the quotient upper side:
lower side varied accordingly between 1:0.11 (F79) and 1: 0.79 (f5 f5
clv1 clv1). As a rule, the leaves of the fasciated genotypes (either
per unit area or even more for the whole leaf) show less hairs than
the corresponding normal forms; only the lower surfaces of the f5
genotypes are an exception.<p>

Only the f2 and f5 genotypes possess a two-layered palisade parenchyma
which constitutes between 43 and 48% of the total thickness of the
blade. The other genotypes have only one palisade layer which makes up
22 - 34% of the leaf thickness. The density of the vascular bundles
varies between 41.92 (f5 f5 ++) and 84.05 cm/cm2 (gla gla ax ax); it
is on the whole negatively correlated with the (definitive) size of
the leaf.<p>

These results, given without any comments, are only a small part of a
greater amount of material, which we will present in greater detail
elsewhere. But these results may be taken to indicate that Arabidopsis
thaliana is a promising subject for the study of the genetical and
physiological aspects of histogenesis.<p>
