Postdoctoral Position in Polyploidy and Epigenetics at The University 
of Texas at Austin 
 
A postdoctoral fellow position is available immediately to study 
genetic and epigenetic mechanisms for non-additive gene regulation in 
Arabidopsis allopolyploids that are derived from closely related 
progenitors A. thaliana and A. arenosa 
(http://polyploidy.biosci.utexas.edu). 
 
Successful candidates should have a Ph.D. in Genetics, Plant Biology, 
Biochemistry and/or Computational Biology with a solid training in 
Mendelian genetics and molecular genetics. Demonstrated interest in 
epigenetic regulation of gene expression will likely be helpful, as 
will technical skills in DNA sequence analysis, RNA detection, 
protein assays, microRNAs, microarrays, computational analysis of 
microarray and new generation sequence data. Salary is competitive 
with experience. 
 
The Chen lab is located in the Section of Molecular Cell and 
Developmental Biology (MCDB) (http://www.biosci.utexas.edu/MCDB/) and 
the Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology 
(http://www.icmb.utexas.edu/). There will be excellent opportunities 
for postdoctoral fellows and graduate students to interact with 
faculty and students among dynamic research groups in the MCDB, ICMB, 
Integrative Biology (http://www.biosci.utexas.edu/IB/), and the 
Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics 
(http://ccbb.biosci.utexas.edu/) 
 
The University of Texas at Austin (http://www.utexas.edu) is an

Highly motivated individuals should send a brief statement of career 
goals and a copy of curriculum vitae including names and addresses of 
three references to:
