To use Arabidopsis as a model system in somatic cell genetics of
higher plants some prerequisites must be fulfilled:<p>

-- establishment of calli and cell cultures;<p>

-- possibility to regenerate a plant from a tissue culture;<p>

-- isolation of haploid tissue by means of another culture;<p>

-- isolation and culture of protoplasts which should allow fusion
between somatic cells.<p>

Some results in this direction have already been mentioned in Arabid.
Inf. Serv. (ANAND, 1966; LOEWENBERG, 1967; HOWELL, 1969; CORCOS and
MULLER, 1972; CORCOS, PIPER and LEWIS, 1973; GRESSHOFF and DOY, 1973).<p>

We report here some complementry data.<p>

1.  Callus induction and culture experiments were performed on
GAMBORG's B5 medium (GAMBORG and EVELEIGH, 1968, 1968).  The amount
and the growth of the callus depend on the cultured organ (stem and
leaf pieces, seeds, anthers), hormone composition and ratio (2, 4D,
NAA, IAA and kinetin) and the race used in the experiment.<p>

In leaf, but mainly in seeds there is a poor callus formation (up to
47% and 22% respectively) at the following low 24D concentrations:
0.05 and 0.5 mg/l.  In stems the production of calli is above 90% at
all 2,4d concentrations tested, i.e. from 0.05 to 2 mg/l, but it is
only above 1 mg/l 2,4D that the callus looks completely
undifferentiated.  Leaves require a high 2,4D concentration, 2 mg/l,
for good callus induction.<p>

The induction time is shorter for stems (9 days) than for seeds (up to
18 days).<p>

With seeds better growth was obtained on B5 medium including 2%
glucose instead of 2% sucrose as carbon source, in the presence of
2,4D with or without kinetin.  On GRESSHOFF and DOY medium, using more
than 10 various hormonal combinations (NAA, IAA, 2,4D and kinetin), we
induced callus from seeds and stems with abnormal appearance and
structure unsuitable for growth in suspension culture.  Among the
races we have tested, Columbia, Coimbra, Estland, and Chisdra gave the
best callus induction, i.e. 100% germinated seeds lead to the
development of calli.<p>

In another culture, performed according to the method described by
GRESSHOFF and DOY (1972), 65%, 56%, and 54% callus induction was
obtained for Martuba, Estland and Wassilewskije respectively.  No
haploid lines were isolated until now.<p>

2.  Suspension culture.  In a series of experiments we used heavy
liquid inocula in a ratio of 1:1 to the fresh medium*, initiating
several growing cycles suspension cultures. For practical reasons
growth was measured using cell packed volume (CPV)** and the number of
viable cells/ml. The subcultures were done by replacing 45 to 60
percent of the suspension "supernatant" CPV with fresh medium to the
final volume of 40 ml.  This subculture system enables us to exploit
the suspension cultures as sources of actively growing single cell
suspension (see table 1).<p>

* a modified B5, containing 2% glucose, two times concentrated
GRESSHOFF and DOY MS1 solution, and 0.05 mg/l kinetin<p>

** using an 0.35 CPV factor (i.e. 35 g tissue are contained in 100 ml
CPV) we express volumetric measurements in grams<p>

Table 1: Growth rates in established cell suspensions, subcultured
every 8 to 10 days in a modified B5 medium.<p>

In spite of the fact that growth rates vary with the growing cycle
these rates remain rather constant for the log portion of the curve.
It is precisely the duration of the log phase which is varying in
inverse ratio to the biomass.<p>

When growth is favoured by optimum inocula rather short generation
times can be obtained.  At higher biomasses (30 percent and more CPV
of the whole culture volume) dissociation is favoured in suspension
cultures.  In such established cell suspensions there is a balance
between cell division and cell expansion, i.e., between growth and
dispersion, the number of viable cells/ml reaching values as high as
7.5 x 10 5 cells/ml.  Meanwhile, cell densities can reach values of 5
x 10 6 cells/ml. Cell separation and dissociation of cell aggregates
are variable characters among different lines used in the experiments.<p>

Depending on the number of viable cells/ml, amount of tissues
inculture and increase in biomass, the duration of a growing cycle is
regulated from case to case.<p>

3.  Karyology of callus and cell suspension. A classical FEULGEN
staining method was used for chromosome countings.  In our conditions
the tested callus cells showed heteroploidy, but 2,4D concentrations
(0.05 to 2 mg/l) did not influence the range of the chromosome number
variation. The age of the callus seems to have an influence on the
ploidy level.  In 3 weeks old seed induced callus an average of 65%
diploid cells was found, while after three months of subculture
diploidy dropped to a mean of 20%.<p>

When different plant organs were used, leaf and especially stem pieces
showed a high degree of polyploidy after only 3 to 4 weeks in culture
(44% diploid cells and 23.9% respectively).<p>

Media were then supplied with different auxins as 2,4D (NAA and IAA
respectively).  It seems now that natural auxins in the presence of
kinetin at very low concentration can produce a reasonable percentage
of diploid tissue; for ex., with 8 mg/l NAA + 0.01 mg/l kinetin there
were as much as 70% of diploid primary calluses, while with 2 mg/L
2,4D + 0.01 mg/L kinetin only 20% of the checked primary calluses
showed the diploid chromosome number.  However, the properties of the
calluses obtained in these conditions are not so favourable to
initiate suspension cultures then on a modified B5 medium. At high
kinetin concentrations (1.5 mg/l) high ploidy levels were registered.<p>

4.  Protoplasts have been obtained from mesophyll of full-grown
leaves, callus tissue and cells in suspension culture.  Enzymes used
were mixtures of meicelase 2% and macerozyme 0.3% in case of leaf
material, driselase 1.5% or cellulase R10 2% and macerozyme R10 1% in
case of cells from callus and suspension cultures.  In the last case
the necessary incubation time and the amount of released protoplasts
appeared to depend on age of cells and culture conditions.<p>

Young, actively dividing cells in callus and cell suspension give the
best release of protoplasts within the shortest incubation time.
Incubation took place on a slow moving gyrotory shaker (30-50t/min),
during 3-6 hours in case of the clelulase R10-macerozyme R-10 mixture;
1/5 - 4 hours in case of the riselase-macerozyme R10 mixture, and, not
shaken, up to 16 hours for the leaf protoplats. Although driselase
seemed to diget the cell walls within a shortr time period, the
released protoplasts were not very stable and showed less resistance
in the next steps of centrifugation. A washg and culture oslution
mainly B5 medium was used to which was added sucrose 1.5%, sorbitol
6%, mannitol 6%, CaCl 2 4.3 mM, 2,4D 1mg/l, at pH 5.8.<p>

The protoplasts stay alive for some weeks, however up to now no cell
divisions have been observed. The osmotic agents sorbitol and mannitol
have shown a strong inhibition effect on growth in cell suspension
culture.  Other agents are being investigated.<p>
