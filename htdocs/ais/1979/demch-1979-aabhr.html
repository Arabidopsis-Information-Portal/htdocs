Among possible effects of chemical mutagens on plants the effect of
decreased fertility of the treated generation, i.e., the induced
sterility in M1, has been last studied. Since this is an inhibiting
effect causing the limited number of progeny plants, it is quite
undesirable not only for those working in the field of mutational
breeding, but also for all those studying theoretical aspects of
mutagenesis. Both groups of researchers are faced with the increasing
sterility in an attempt to increase the mutation rate with dose, and
consequently the induced sterility in M1 stands in the way of
furthering experimental studies of mutagenesis in plants.
Concurrently, the effects of partial or complete sterility of M1
induced by high doses may be studied, as this knowledge bears on the
understanding of mutagenesis for applied research. The mechnisms of
changes finally leading to full lack of progeny have been least
explored.<p>

Both in radiationgenetic studies and in the works on chemical
mutagenesis in plants it is assumed that induced sterility is related
to some changes at a genetic rather than a physiological level. The
sterility in M1 is considered to develop as a consequence of
chromosome aberrations in the cells of the embryo, which do not
prevent mitosis but block normal meiosis and gametogenesis. A certain
contribution of mutations in genic and cytoplasmic sterility is also
admitted.<p>

Generally in mutagenic studies on higher plants several homogenous
effects related to fertility are taken into consideration, namely the
frequency of sterile plants in M1 (the ratio of the number of sterile
plants to 100 survivals in the experiment), the frequency of the same
fruits, and finally the decrease of the overall seed number pr M1
plant in response to the mutagenic factor.<p>

The existing methods of genetic investigations on Arabidopsis thaliana
(L.) as a model plant permit a detailed study of the sterility effect.
With the embryo test, it is possible to follow in a disclosed pod the
formation of seed embryos on the mutagenized plants. It is possible to
differentiate the true sterile seed buds, the lethals of the
haplophase, from the embryos which died as a result of the genetic
block in different stages of zygotic development, the lethals of the
diplophase. Although both anormalities lead to the lack of seed, only
the former bears on the study of sterility effect.<p>

Therefore, our task was to specify the conditions of the mutagenic
treatment so that all the plants in the experiment had true sterile
seed buds. Our second task was to find out whether "the trait of
sterility" in the absolutely sterile plants is shared by all the
cells, including the somatic cells developed from the embryos upon
mutagenic treatment.<p>

To tackle the first task we have chosen the mutagen, its concentration
and time of exposure so that all the plants grown from the treated
seeds had a normal development until flowering but yielded only
sterile seed buds. The conditions concerning the requirements in
Arabidopsis was an exposure of the seeds in 1 mM N-nitroso-methyl urea
for 4 hours. Under the above conditions we obtained, with good
reproducibility, 100% sterile seed buds in all plants at 75-80%
survival against the control; the frequency of sterile seed buds in
the control was 5.8 +/- .5%.<p>

To solve the second task, we used the culture technique of isolated
tissues which permits induction of dedifferentiated growth in the
somatic cells with subsequent regeneration of whole plants to be
analyzed for fertility. Thus, our experiments consisted of the
induction of sterility in Arabidopsis and the examination of the
somatic cells of completely sterile plants.<p>

Since for callus induction young, growing tissues of the plant before
the reproductive phase may be used, one has to be sure that the
experimental plants are sterile, that the conditions of treatment
specified in the preliminary experiments meet the requirement. Then we
repeated the experiment in which seeds were treated and plants grew in
vitro until the rosette stage under aseptic conditions.<p>

Seeds of A. thaliana race Enkheim were used. The mutagen was dissolved
in a dimethylformamide, citrate-phosphate buffer, adjusted to pH=5,
and then the seeds were submerged into the mixture. In the control the
same mixture was used but without mutagen. There were 150 seeds for
each variant of the experiment. Among plants sown and grown on KNOOP's
agar medium until the beginning of flowering, samples of 15 plants
typical for the variant were taken. Leaf blades with leaf stalks were
explanted and transferred to Gamborg's medium with addition of
indolacetic acid (IAA) and kinetin (at 1 mg/l) for callus formation.
Three explants were taken from each plant in order to reckon in
individual features, so there were initially 45 test tubes per
variant. The test tubes were kept in the thermostat at 25*degrees*C
and 70% humidity. Callus formation was initiated after a fortnight
being more efficient in the control. There callus was growing over the
whole leaf surface forming regularly increasing biomass and entering
organogenesis after some time. In the test tubes containing the
mutagen callus growth was slower; only callus tubercles and very
rarely regenerants appeared, consequently their total number was lower
than in the control (Table 1).<p>

After the emergence of regenerants the test tubes were exposed to
light (1800 lux). For better rooting the regenerants were transferred
to Gamborg's medium wihout IAA and kinetin. Under these conditions the
differences between the experimental and control variants were
somewhat smoothened but then sharpened abruptly for the seed
productivity of the regenerants.<p>

All experimental regenerants had immature pods containing only sterile
seed buds. Pods remained looking as expanded ovary, not more than 7 mm
long, their number was the same as in the control, but there was not a
single seed in them. It is noteworthy that sterile regenerants of the
control occurred as "clusters" from different calluses of one plant,
i.e., there was certain influence of the individual features of the
initial explant on the seed productivity of the regenerant.<p>

Although the results obtained do not dispel the current conditions of
the nature of induced sterility, nevertheless, they let arise
questions. Thus, the admission that allelic or nonallelic sterility
mutations occur simultaneously in all the cells of all plants does not
seem plausible. Chromosome aberrations, if persisting through mitosis
until meiosis, could of course persist during dedifferentiation, too,
but whether they have any relation to sterility is rather questionable
in view of the evidence available. According to Ehrenberg and Gichner
(1967), there was no correlation between the aberrant genic activity
of N-nitroso-alkyl amides and their ability of sterility induction;
the same observation was made by Nararaja and Natarajan (1965), when a
comparison of the effects of methyl and ehtyl analogs of alkyl
sulfonates on barley was made. In a detailed study of radiation
induced sterility in peas, Gottschalk (1975) did not find any
aberrations charactristic of mitotic cells in the premiotic phases nor
on the cells undergoing the reduction division.<p>

Thus, our results suggest that there may be some other explanations of
the induced sterility effect in M1. Prevously we supposed that some
mechanism of induced exchange at the somatic cell level is involved in
such mutagenic effects as chlorophyll chimeras in M1 (Demchenko et
al., 1972). The sterility in M1 is conceivably related to somatic
recombination, too. Caused by an intensive and long mutagenic
treatment, both effects are connected with maximal tolerable,
sublethal actions, i.e., when repair processes play a decisive role.
Postreplicative repair involving recombination (Boyce et a., 1964)
presupposes exchange at the molecular level. The molecular mechnism of
exchange is involved in crossingover and also in the normal meiosis
and reproduction of gametes. As for mitosis, it is generally known
(Westergaard, 1964) that no recombination takes place; it may occur
only in response to mutagens (Demchenko and Efremova, 1973). The high
frequency of recombination in mitotic cells may prevent its normal
progress in meiosis. In fact, disturbances of chromosome synapsis and
chiasmata (Gottschalk, 1975) characteristic for the meiosis in M1 seem
to be related to abnormalities in the molecular mechanism of
crossingover. This reasoning permits to explain our failure to obtain
fertile regenerants from M1 chlorophyll chimeric tissues (Demchenko et
al., 1972), no matter whether a normal green or a chlorophyll
defective region of the leaf was explanted.<p>
