The uptake of water and ions is, together with photosynthesis the only
way for higher plants to obtain their basic material for biosynthesis.
Many data have been obtained regarding the uptake of kations,
especially sodium, potassium and rubidium (NISSEN 1974). Much less is
known about the uptake of anious, especially of nitrate.  In the
latter case the study of the uptake process is complicated by the
rapid disappearance of nitrate after it has been taken up by the
plant, due to its reduction, via nitrite, to ammonia, which
subsequently is incorporated into amino acids. This conversion of
nitrate may influence its uptake. Therefore, uptake experiments using
mutants in which uptake and/or processing of nitrate is altered might
yield more information about the uptake mechanism.<p>

For the isolation of nitrate reductase-less mutants, selection for
resistance to chlorate may be used (OOSTINDIER-BRAAKSMA and FEENSTRA
1973a).  However, by this method, also mutants can be isolated with a
normal to above normal level of nitrate reductase, but showing a lower
chlorate and chloride content, after exposure to chlorate (chl-1 type
mutants, see Van der LAAN et al 1971 and OOSTINDIER-BRAAKSMA and
FEENSTRA 1973a).<p>

A decrease in the uptake of chlorate might explain the chlorate
resistance of such mutants.  Since reduction of both nitrate and
chlorate is brought about by the same enzyme, uptake of these ions
might be mediated by one carrier system, and thus mutants with a
lowered uptake of chlorate might concurrently show an altered uptake
of nitrate.  If this hypothesis came true, mutants of the chl-1 type
could be profitably used for the study of the uptake of nitrate.
Mutant B25 (OOSTINDIER-BRAAKSMA and FEENSTRA 1973b and 1974) could be
useful studying the uptake of nitrate since this mutant is nitrate
reductase-less and thus unable to process absorbed nitrate.  A line
with both the chl-1 mutation and the B25 mutation has been
constructed, to study the interaction between the genes.<p>

Methods were developed for the growth of large numbers of Arabidopsis
thaliana seedlings in water culture and for the measurement of the
uptake of nitrate and chlorate by these plants.  Time curves showed
that the uptake of chlorate in wild type plants was comparable to the
uptake of nitrate. The chlorate upake was strongly reduced in the
presence of nitrate. This may indicate a competitive inhibition and
thus a common uptake system. Wild type plants, grown on an ammonium
medium, showed a lower uptake of chlorate and nitrate than plants
grown on a nitrate medium.  This may point to an influence of the
induction of nitrate reductase by nitrate on the uptake of nitrate and
chlorate, or an induction by nitrate of the nitrate carrier itself.
Gifts of nitrate and chlorate after N-starvation during a few days
resulted in higher uptake rates of nitrate as well as of chlorate.<p>

Wild type plants, chl-1 and B25 mutants were grown on an ammonium
nitrate medium. After two days of N-starvation, the nitrate uptake was
determined.  Uptake of nitrate by chl-1 indeed turned out to be
smaller compared to wild type. This implies that a mutation has been
induced in a gene playing a role in the control of the uptake of
nitrate. The uptake of nitrate by the B25 mutant was higher than by
wild type plants. The same observation was made with chlorate as
substrate.<p>

Apparently the B25 mutation (nitrate reductase-less) in combination
with the allele chl-1* induces an enhanced uptake of nitrate and
chlorate under the experimental conditions.<p>

Experiments on the kinetics of nitrate uptake are being caried out.
Preliminary results indicate the existence of at least two phases,
with different Km and V max.  Expriments on the uptake of nitrate both
by wild type plants and by mutants are being continued. The next step
will be to complete the study of the kinetics of the uptake, and to
establish the influence of external conditions like pH, counter ions
and temperature.<p>
