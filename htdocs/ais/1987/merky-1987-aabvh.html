ABSTRACT<p>

On board the orbital stations "Salyut-6" and "Salyut-7" as well as on
the biosatellite "Cosmos-1667" the experiments have been performed to
study the role of gravity for growth, development and anatomy of
morphological structure in Arabidopsis thaliana.<p>

It was established that under microgravity the roots of the seedlings
underwent growth in a similar way while hypocotyls exhibited a more
intensive growth as compared to that under congrol conditions. In
comparison to the control the area of the hypocotyl cross section as
well as the area of the hypocotyl cortex cells and of the central
cylinder increased.<p>

Under spaceflight conditions A. thaliana underwent through a full
cycle of individual development. The seeds sown during the spaceflight
germinated, performed growth processes, formed vegetative and
generative organs and according to the final result they succeeded in
fecundation, embryogenesis and ripening of seeds. In spite of
significant deviations noted in the intensity of growth and
development of test plants, a part of seeds being formed in space
appeared to be valuable biologically. The test plants of the second
generation, according to majority of biometrical indicators, didn't
differ from the control.<p>

The average area of chloroplasts of the plants grown in space appeared
to be smaller than in the control, yet their number per cell didn't
change. Together with normal chloroplasts, organelles with a changed
ultrastructure have been noted in space. The area of epidermal cells
and of the primary cortex of a flower-bearing stem of the test plants
increased.<p>

INTRODUCTION<p>

The significant effect of gravity on the anatomical morphological
structure of plants in the process of their phylogenetic development
was proved to be beyond doubt (Merkys, 1976; Dubinin, 1976). However,
the role of gravity in the individual development of plant species
existing at present is not quite clear yet. There were views
maintaining that gravity serves as a kind of guideline in respect of
which the axes of plants shoots are being formed (Sinnott, 1960). If
it is really so, the growth of plants under weightlessness may differ
essentially from that under gravity conditions. The first short-term
experiments performed under spaceflight conditions disclosed only
insignificant differences in the growth and morphogenesis of control
and test shoots (Gray, Edwards, 1971; Merkys et al., 1975). However,
the subsequent long-term experiments of plants growth in space showed
significant deviations in their growth (Dubinin et al., 1977),
development (Pafenov et al., 1981; Kordyum et al., 1984), anatomy,
morphological structure and metabolism (Laurinavicius et al., 1984).
The possiblity of higher plants to perform a full cycle of individual
development under microgravity, i.e, during spaceflight was called in
question.<p>

The paper presents the results of experiments performed on board the
Salyut-6 and Salyut-7 space station as well as on the Cosmos-1667
biosatellite concerning the studies of gravity's role in shoot growth,
performance of a full cycle ontogeny and peculiarities of the
anatomical morphological structure in A. thaliana plants.<p>

METHODS<p>

To study the role of gravity for seed germination and shoot growth,
two short-term tests have been performed on board the orbital station
Salyut-6 and on the Kosmos-1667 biosatellite. Additionally, an
experiment has been performed on board the Salyut-7 to investigate the
possibility of higher plants to undergo a full ontogenetic cycle of
development under space flight conditions. In all the experiments, the
seeds of Arabidopsis thaliant (L.) Heynh., race Enkheim, were used.<p>

In the experiments with shoots, the seeds were fixed on the strips of
filter paper by the agar solution. The strips with dry seeds were
placed into packages made of filter paper. During the spaceflight on
board the Salyut-6 station the moistening of seeds and fixation of
shoots with Navashin's mixture after the test was performed by an
astronaut. The experiment lasted for 120 hrs. including the following
variants.<p>

1. Stationary control on the Earth<p>

2. Centrifuge on the Earth (1 g)<p>

3. Stationary position in space (weightlessness)<p>

4. Centrifuge in space (l g)<p>

Temperature in Salyut-6 ranged between 19-22*degrees*C.<p>

In the experiment on board the Cosmos-1667 biosatellite, the packages
with seeds were placed into a hermetic container. The moistening of
seeds with water was performed on earth 41 hrs. before launching the
rocket. Flight duration was 165 hrs. Shoot fixation by 2.5%
glutaraldehyde with a subsequent post-fixation by 1% osmium tetroxide
was performed 4 hrs. after the landing of the satellite. The ground
control experiment included 2 variants: 1) in a stationary position,
ii) on the horizontal clinostat (2 rpm). The experimental
investigation of A. thaliana to perform a full cycle of ontogeny under
spaceflight conditions on board the Salyut-7 station was performed in
a container made of acrylic plastic. A sterile medium was maintained
inside the container. The air exchange was performed through the
antibacterial filters. The seeds were sown on the surface of the
agarized mineral nutrient medium (Ivanov et al., 1966) during
spaceflight with the help of pneumatic sowing facilities. An
illumination round the clock of 7 klx was supplied by a daylight lamp.
Temperature fluctuations of the environmental air ranged between
18-24*degrees*C. The duration of the experiment was 69 days. Plant
fixation was performed after landing of the spacecraft with 2.5%
glutaraldehyde, postfixation by 1% osmium tetroxide solution and a
subsequenct embedding in epon. The control test was performed in an
identical apparatus under the same conditions of temperature and
illumination as in space.<p>

Biometrical measurements and statistical data processing were
performed with the help of the system IBAS (Opton, FRG).<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

The question of the interaction between the growth determining systems
of plants and gravity remains open. Different results were received
using different species of plants on board a spacecraft (Table 1).<p>

Table 1: The effect of spaceflight factors on the growth of shoots (in
%, as compared to the control).<p>

There are certain difficulties in the interpretation of these data,
the more as the majority of experiments were conducted only with a
single repetition. It is possible that the response of various species
of plants to the effect of spaceflight conditions has certain
peculiarities. It is necessary to take into account the fact that some
experiments were performed not in hermetic containers but in the
atmosphere of the spacecraft cabins. Other methodical defects should
not be neglected either, especially in cases when the experiment in
space is followed only by a ground stationary control without the
clinostat under ground conditions and without the centrifuge under
spaceflight conditions. A choice of model species of plants plays an
important role too. In this respect, a most suitable model for
spaceflight investigations is represented by A. thaliana because of
its miniature size, short ontogenetic cycle, peculiarities of growth
and development, the presence of various mutant lines and a number of
other features.<p>

In Table 2 the results of two experiments are presented performed
during spaceflight on orbital Salyut-6 station and Cosmos-1667
biosatellite to study the growth of shoots of A. thaliana under
microgravity.<p>

Table 2: The length of hypocotyls and roots of A. thaliana grown under
changed gravity.<p>

The analysis of the data received on board the Salyut-6 station showed
the growth of shoots to be the same under ground conditions in a
stationary position and on the centrifuge, while in space the
intensity of growth was considerably lower both under weightlessness
and on the centrifuge. Probably, this difference may be regarded as an
integral result of the negative effect of certain factors related to
spaceflight (gaseous air composition in a spacecraft, electromagnetic
fields, etc.) on the plant growth. Comparison offshoot growth in space
in a stationary position and on the centrifuge at l g is more
informative. It is evident that the roots in these two variants
undergo growth of equal intensity, while hypocotyl growth was
significantly greater under weightlessness than on the centrifuge.<p>

The same conclusion may be drawn in respect to the role of gravity in
the growth process of A. thaliana when considering the experimental
data received on board the Cosmos-1667 satellite. It is interesting to
note that in comparison with the control, the imitation of
weightlessness conditions on the clinostat did not lead to the change
of length either of roots or hypocotyls. However, a prolonged growth
of A. thaliana on the clinostat results in the essential changes of
growth, development and some morphological indicators (Brown et al.,
1976; Merkys, Laurinavicius, 1980). Hypocotyls of A. thaliana grown on
board the Cosmos-1667 satellite differed from the control in
anatomical structure which was expressed by the increase of both the
area of the cross section of hyptocotyl, the central cylinder and of
the average area of parenchyma cells of the primary cortex (Table 3.)<p>

of hypocotyls.<p>

The following stage of the study on the role of gravity in the growth
and development of plants is represented by the experiment on board
the Salyut station, where A. thaliana growth went from seed to seed.
Earlier, such experiments under spaceflight conditions were not
successful (Kordyum et al., 1984) and even in cases when plants
succeeded in yielding seeds in space this was due to the fact that the
initial stages of the development of the test plants up to the stage
of flowering were performed under ground conditions (Parfenov et al.,
1981). The main feature of the described experiments conditioned by
the fact that the seeds were sown during spaceflight on the orbital
station and a possible influence of gravity on the growth process was
excluded. And just this peculiarity distinguished the main methodical
difference of the present experiment from all those performed earlier
(Kordyum et al., 1984; Parfenov et al., 1981). Under spaceflight
conditions the seeds underwent germination and reached the state of
grown up plants. They were flowering, forming seeds a part of which
reached their full ripeness and in the phase of complete development
they were brought from space to laboratory. In Table 4 results are
presented characterizing the control plants and the plants in space.<p>

Table 4: Morphological indicators of A. thaliana grown under ground
conditions and on board Salyut-7.<p>

It is a well known fact that the general morphology of plants under
the influence of environmental factors such as mineral nutrition,
illumination, humidity of soil and air undergoes great changes.
Nevertheless, in the present experiment where the plants of two
variants were affected by similar conditions of illumination, mineral
nutrition and humidity, the essential changes in general morphology
should be considered as a result of the effect of spaceflight factors
directly on the physiological processes of plants or indirectly
through the chagnes in behaviour of gaseous and liquid phases under
microgravity.<p>

The following step of the given experiment is the determination of the
full biological value of A. thaliana seeds grown in space. After a
month, when the embryonic pause had been over, the random samples of
control and tested seeds were sown in test tubes, and the plants were
cultivated in the agarized medium under sterile conditions according
to a generally accepted method (Ivanov et al., 1966). The ripe seeds
of the first generation were sown repeatedly and observation was
performed on the growth and development of plants of the second
generation. Biometric indications characterizing the germination of
seeds, growth and reproductive peculiarities of plants of the first
and the second generation are presented in Table 5.<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol25/vol25-pg112-tab5.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

Table 5: Growth and development of A. thaliana of M 1 and M 2
generations, grown from seeds formed under spaceflight conditions.<p>

The data presented show that 67.6% of seeds formed on the Earth grew
into normal fruit bearing plants and only 42% of normal plants were
received from the seeds developed in space. The plants of the second
generation did not show significant deviations either in morphology or
in rate of the further development. Consequently, about 40% of the
seeds formed under spaceflight conditions appeared to be valuable
biologically.<p>

Together with differences in the general morphology of test plants, as
compared to the control, under the influence of spaceflight factors
some changes were observed in the anatomy of leaves and stems as well
as in the structure of the plastids. As the rosette leaves died before
the completion of the experiment, an anatomical analysis was performed
of the green leaves located on the apex of a flowering stem. Figure 1
shows the fragments of the leaf cross section. The control variant
exhibits a dorsonventral structure revealing a tight compression of
oblong parenchyma cells on one side of the leaf. In the test variant,
mesophyll consisted of more homogeneously rounded cells on both sides
of the leaf, and the extent of dorsoventrality was found to be
different from the control. The number of chloroplasts per mesophyll
cell of the plant leaf did not change under the influence of
spaceflight factors. However, the area and dimensions of these
organelles are significantly lower in space as compared to the control
(Table 6).<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol25/vol25-pg113-tab6.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

Table 6: The effect of spaceflight conditions on morphological
indicators of chloroplasts.<p>

The chlroplasts of plant cells in both variants possessed an orginary
shape with a normally developed system of inner membranes. However,
together with such chloroplasts plastids of an unusual shape were
present, sometimes posessing inclusions and invaginations. The grana
were not complex and were found in little amounts, so the main part of
a plastid was filled with a granular stroma. In such chloroplasts, the
grana are often located not parallel to the longitudinal axis as usual
but are twisted in a vortex (Figure 1). As compared to the control, a
significantly lower amount of starch grains was found in the leaf
chloroplasts of the test plants or they were absent at all.<p>

To analyze the anatomical structure of the flowering stems, the cross
sections were taken from the zone lying 10-12 mm below the plant apex.
At first sight the general structure in the control and in the test
variants looked identical (Figure 1). However, the morphometrical
analysis of separate tissues showed statistically significant
differences (Table 7). First of all, under spaceflight conditions the
thickness of a flowering stem increased. Principally it was a result
of the increase of the area of epidermal cells and primary cortex.
Besides, the parenchyma cells of th primary cortex in the test, as
compared to the control, acquired a more spheric shape. This leads to
the formation of intercellular space, the area of which is larger than
that in the control.<p>

Table 7: The effect of spaceflight (Salyut-7) on the anatomical
structure of stem.<p>

A significantly more expressed lignification was noted in a vascular
bundle of the stem as compared to the control plants. The first ones
contained thicker walls of parenchmal cells (0.13-0.32 m) in
comparison with the control (0.09-0.14 m). These changes can hardly be
regarded as specific after effects of spaceflight conditions, as the
tendency to lignification and thickening of the plant cellular walls
is observed under various unfavourable effects, for example, the lack
of nitrogen or water (Levin, 1973).<p>

Thus, principally, spaceflight conditions did not show any influence
on the processes of differentiation, morphogenesis and embryogenesis
of A. thaliana in the course of a full cycle of ontogeny for at least
one generation. Nevertheless, such a conclusion must be considered as
a preliminary one. At one time we used to separate the effect of
gravity on the plant spatial orientation from that on its growth
(Merkys, 1976). The dependence of growth and morphogenesis on gravity
is under study so far and the given results of investigations in this
field represent the first experiment in which A. thaliana underwent a
full cycle of ontogeny, from seed to seed, under spaceflight
conditions. Under spaceflight conditions the experimenter is faced by
two groups of factors which cannot be imitated under ground
conditions, such as the changed gravity value (microgravity) and
physical processes including heat and mass exchange which are under
the influence of microgravity. The level of perturbing accelerations
on board an orbital station makes up to 10E-4 to 10E-6 g (Lebedev,
Polezhaev, 1984) and in separate cases short-term overloadings may
reach even higher values (Mashinskij et al., 1976). A threshold value
of gravitropic reaction of shoots under microgravity makes up 10E-3 to
10E-4 g (Merkys et al., 1984), thus the intrpretation of the results
of the study of plant growth and morphogenesis received under
spaceflight conditions should be done with caution. Furthermore, it is
evident that up to date not only the question of a possible direct
effect of gravity on the growth and morphogenetic processes but also
its indirect effect through the change of a number of physical
parameters remains open. The growth deviations from the averaged norm
cannot serve as indicators of the significant effect of one or another
factor. A lot of examples can be presented revealing the change of
other ecological or tropical factors to have a more significant effect
on the morphology and anatomy of plants (Khokhryakov, 1975) than those
established in this expriment. However, we hope that the experiment on
A. thaliana, the firt among the plants to have performed a full cycle
of ontogeny under spaceflight conditions, will serve as a basis for
the further studies of the physiology of growth related to the gravity
factor.<p>
