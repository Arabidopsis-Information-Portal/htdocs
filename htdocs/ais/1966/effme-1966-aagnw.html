	Among 64 local populations collected in 1963 and 1964 there were found 18 with 10 percent generative plants after 42 days when growing at 25+/-3*degrees*C under continuous illumination with 1250 lux (CETL, DOBROVOLNA, and EFFMERTOVA, 1965; CETL, 1965).  The original seeds of these "winter annual" populations were vernalized 0 (control) 2, 4, and 6 weeks at +2+/-1*degree*C.  The vernalization requirement was expressed by means of a minimum vernalization rate which induces 100 percent generative plants in the conditions indicated above.<p>

	These data show that the vernalization requirement of moravian populations is nearly the same as reported by RATCLIFFE (1965) for races from Britain, but lower than for those from the Scottish Highlands.<p>

	The comparison of our populations with the samples kindly supplied by Dr. RATCLIFFE and by the Exchange Service of the botanical gardens is underway.<p>
