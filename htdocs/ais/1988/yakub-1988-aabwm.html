Under definite conditions, the coupling factor I of chloroplasts is
able to catalyse the reverse reaction of ATP hydrolysis along with ATP
synthesis. The reaction of ATP hydrolysis displays quite easily in
mitochondries while the ATPase function of the enzyme is latent in
chloroplasts and can be discovered only after its preliminary
activation. In accordance with the up-to-date notions ATPase activity
can be modified by alcohols (Anthon and Jagendorf, 1983). Similar
research was carried out on the classical objects such as spinach and
pea. But in Arabidopsis which was broadly used for the investigation
of photosynthesis genetics, the coupling factor I was not separated
and its activity and properties were not investigated.<p>

In the present work, the results of ATPase activity measurement of
isolated coupling factor I of Arabidopsis chloroplasts and the
influence of ethanol on the enzyme activity are described.<p>

We used the original wild type Enkheim of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.)
Heynh.. The coupling factor I CF I was prepared by Younis' method
(Younis, 1977). The chloroform extract was freed from admixtures by
filtration through the Sephadex G-200 column. ATPase activity was
determined by the potentiometry method at the 37*degree*C in 10 ml
volumes of 2 mM tris-HC1 buffer (pH 7.8), 5mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl 2 (or
CaCl2), .08 - .1 mg of protein. The constant rate of ATP hydrolysis
was evaluated for 30-120 sec. Protein concentration was determined
according to Lowry method (Lowry, 1951).<p>

Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ -dependent ATPase are presented in chloroplasts and
activated in different conditions. Mg 2+ -dependent ATPase is active
in the complex of CF I with the membrane but after isolation from the
membrane, CF I displays Ca 2+ -ATPase activity (Malyan, 1980). The
cation specificity of Arabidopsis coupling factor I is presented in
Table 1.<p>

Table 1: Effect of cations and 25% ethanol on ATPase activity of
Arabidopsis chloroplast coupling factor I (micro m of P i/mg of
protein per min).<p>

Ca-ATPase activity of the solubilized CF I exceeds threefold the
Mg-dependent activity of the enzyme. At the same time the addition of
ethanol did not influence the Ca-ATPase but Mg-ATPase activity
increased eightfold.<p>

Investigations of the effect of different concentrations of ethanol on
the Mg-ATPase activity of CF I shows that the alcohol accelerates
essentially the rate of ATP hydrolysis. Maximum activity is reached by
28-30% of ethanol (Table 2).<p>

chloroplast coupling factor I (microM of P i/mg of protein per min).<p>

Effect of ethanol may be explained by the exchanges of hydrophilic
hydrophobic balance in the obligomerous protein CF I, relaxation of
hydrophobic contacts in some regions of the protein. Perhaps this
facilitates the access of the substrat to active sites of the enzyme
(Goldfeld, 1986).<p>
