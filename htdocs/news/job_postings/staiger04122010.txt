Research associate Plant Molecular Biology

A position is open for a Research associate at the Chair of Molecular
Cell Physiology, Bielefeld University, Germany

  
Possible areas of research include the molecular basis of circadian
rhythms in Arabidopsis, interaction of the circadian system with the
environment, plant stress responses, post-transcriptional control
mechanisms or related own projects.

Our group enjoys strong collaborations with the Department of Physics as
part of the interdisciplinary research program SFB 613 "Single molecule
processes and molecular recognition" to study RNA-protein interaction
and subcellular localization.

The position is available for 3 years initially with the possibility of
a long term extension.

Applications are encouraged from candidates with a strong background in
molecular biology, RNA biochemistry, plant physiology, tissue culture or
experience in transcript profiling.

The candidate will participate in the teaching program and the
supervision of Bachelor, Master and PhD students.

    
Informal inquiries and applications are welcome to
