The data presented here comprise a brief summary of results of
experiments carried out in collaboration with Dr. H. ABEL and his
colleagues from the Zentralinstitut fur Kernforschung, Dresden. The
results will be published in detail elsewhere.<p>

Dry seeds of A. thaliana (L.) HEYNH., race Enkheim, about a year old,
were irradiated with 200 kV X-rays (mean energy about 1 MeV mean LET
along the track = 1.6 keV/mcm), 6.3 MeV H ions (LET = 6.7 keV/mcm),
and 25.1 MeV He ions (LET = 26 keV/mcm) at doses ranging from about
0.9 to about 40 krad.  For H and He ions the energy values were
calculated at the seed surface level, and LET for the matter of unit
density.<p>

Dose-response curves for root growth, survival, flowering date, and
sterility grade were obtained. For root measurements the method
elaborated by MULLER j(1964) was applied, and it was found that the
effectiveness of radiations increased with LET, although rather small
RBE values were obtained (below 2).  The other M1 effects were studied
only at doses ranging from about 0.9 to about 20 krad.  In this dose
range no statistically significant differences between the irradiated
and control lots were observed. The flowering was delayed slightly
with increasing doses, and no significant differences between
dose-response curves for X, H, and He irradition were found.  However,
the sterility grade estimated as fraction of completely undeveloped
embryos among all the values were overlapped by rather high variabilty
of the data.  At present screening for M2 mutations is being in
progress.<p>
