Postdoctoral Research Associate
Signal transduction in Arabidopsis anther development
University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee
 
A full-time postdoctoral position supported by NSF is available to study the molecular 
mechanism of signal transduction during anther development in Arabidopsis (Zhao et al., 
(2002) Genes & Development 16: 2021-2031; Jia et al., (2008) PNAS 105:2220-2225.). 
The successful applicant should be a highly motivated individual with a Ph.D. in plant 
science or a related field emphasizing molecular biology. Experience in molecular 
genetics and protein work is highly desirable, but not required.  This position can be 
extended for up to three years.  
 
All qualified persons are encouraged to apply. Please email a cover letter, CV, and 
contact information for three references to Dazhong Dave Zhao (dzhao@uwm.edu). 
Review of applications will begin immediately, and will continue until the position is 
filled.
