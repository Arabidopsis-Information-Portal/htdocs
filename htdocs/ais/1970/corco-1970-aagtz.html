<h2> Toxicity of 5-bromodeoxy-uridine to Arabidopsis thaliana in agar medium</h2><p>

A CORCOS<p>

(Kedzie Laboratory, Department of Natural Science, Michigan State
University, East Lansing, Mich. U.S.A.)<p>

HIRONO and SMITH (1969) have reported that 5-bromodeoxyuridine at the
rate of 1 x 10E-5M in the medium caused single gene mutations in
Arabidopsis.  This rate seems very low when compared to the one used
in phage work. The writer had obtained conditional lethal mutants in
P22 phage with the same mutagenic agent at the rate of 100 micrograms
per cc (CORCOS and ORIAS, 1963.  Therefore, he wanted to check if
5-RDU at higher concentrations would be more effective and
concentrations of 100 micrograms per cc, 1 x 10 E-4M. 1 x 10 E-5M of
5-BDU were added to the Veleminsky and Gichner medium (VELEMINSKY and
GICHNER, 1964.  The medium was then autoclaved for 15 minutes at 15
pounds pressure.<p>

At the concentration of 100 micrograms per cc, no seeds of Arabidopsis
germinated. At the concentration of 1 x 10 E-4 many of the plants
germinated, but died 2 or 3 days later.  At the concentration of 1 x
10 E-5, the one used by HIRONO and SMITH, germination was not
impaired, some plants died after a few days, but 84 of 128 survived
and those surviving are not progeny-tested for possible mutant lines.<p>
