Meiotic recombination initiation mechanisms in Arabidopsis thaliana

In budding yeast, meiotic recombination events are initiated by DNA double strand 
breaks (DSBs) catalysed by the Spo11 protein. In this species, DSB formation also 
requires nine other proteins whose molecular function is poorly understood. Nevertheless, 
recent studies tend to group them into subcomplexes, indicating that they can be 
intimately linked and can form a large recombination initiation complex in which DSBs 
are made.
Many investigations have been carried out to identify in other organisms, homologs of 
these DSB forming proteins. Unfortunately, unlike Spo11, most of these are not 
conserved across kingdoms. Furthermore, even when DSB proteins are conserved, their 
role in meiotic DSB formation is missing.
A large-scale forward genetic approach to isolate plant meiotic genes has revealed the 
existence of new meiotic functions that could be necessary for meiotic DSB formation in 
the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The selected candidate will be in charge of the 
cloning and the characterisation of several of these genes at the molecular, genetic and 
cytological levels.
A large range of tools are already available in the laboratory (as chromosome structure or 
meiotic recombination progression markers), while others will be developed by the 
selected candidate in order to analyse the function of the isolated DSB forming proteins, 
as well as their in vitro or in vivo interactions.

Candidate profile

Applicants should have completed their PhD less than 5 years ago. A strong background 
in molecular biology, genetics or cytology will be appreciated. The position is available 
before the end of the year for a period of two years.
