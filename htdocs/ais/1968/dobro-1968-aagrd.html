Phenotypical differences in developmental characters, e.g., in the
number of days to flowering, observed between and within different
natural populations of A. thaliana and also between and within
different plants in a population are thought to be caused genetically
(NAPP-ZINN) 1964; CETL, 1965).  But yet no evidence has been brought
forwad for the correctn4ss of this assumption.  &#197; possibility to
test the extent to which these differences are of genetic nature,
consists in the comparison of the values obtrained for individual
plants and their progenies.  It is known that in an autogamous
population the coeficient of heritability h2, is represented by teh
offspring-parent regression coefficient, h2 = b0P.  Thus, the h2 value
can be used to answer the above question.<p>

In the present experiment with the natural population Str which
appears to be highly variable and is of "summer annual" type, the
number of days to the appearance of flower primordia and the number of
rosette leaves were studied in 147 mother plants and their progenies.
The number of offspring was variable from 10 to 19 with a mean of 12.6
plants per progeny. Both, the mother plants and progenies were grown
under controlled experimental conditions (25=/-3*degrees*C, continuous
illumination of 1250 lux).  The b values were estimated (1) as an
unweighted regression of progeny means on mothers, (2) as a regression
of individual progeny data on repeated maternal ones, and (3) as a
weighted regession of progeny means on mothers (KEMPTHORNE and TANDON,
1953; REEVE, 1955).  The results are given in the following table:<p>

The regression coefficients for both characters are thus highly
significant and show that in the number of days to appearance of the
flower primordia about 50% and in the number of rosette leaves about
40% of the phenotypic variation is represented by the additive
component of genetic variability.  Therefore, at least a half of the
phenotypical differences observed in the population studied can be
ascribed to genes.  The experiments will be continued.<p>
