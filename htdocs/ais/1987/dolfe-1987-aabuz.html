Arabidopsis alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) is a well characterized
biochemical marker, from which three naturally occuring alleles from
one single gene (S, F and A) have been identified (Dolferus and
Jacobs, 1984). The enzyme has been purified and a crude antiserum has
been prepared against it. ADH exists as a dimer with a molecular
weight of 87,000 daltons.<p>

The enzyme is supposed to play a crucial role for the survival of the
plant under anaerobic stress conditions (Sachs et al., 1980). In
Arabidopsis we demonstrated that ADH activity is markedly increased
during callus induction. At the plant level, activity rapidly declines
during the germination process and is no more represented in mature
plants, except for some specific cell types like pollen and the root
tip (Dolferus et al., 1985). During anaerobic treatment it was also
shown that Arabidopsis ADH is one of the few proteins which remain
actively synthesized. The enzyme can also be induced in plantlets by
the synthetic phytohormone 2, 4-D.<p>

The expression of the ADH gene shows several interesting features of a
eukaryotic gene, i.e., developmental and tissue specific regulation
and environmental stimuli influencing gene expression. The ADH gene
from the race Be-O was isolated using maize ADH 1 cDNA as a probe and
was completely sequenced. The gene shows complete homology with the
gene isolated by Chang and Meyerowitz (1986) from another race but the
same variant (A-type), and has about 80% sequence homology with maize
ADH. The identification of sequences in the 5' promoter region
responsible for regulation of gene expression is currently under
investigation.<p>

Several ADH null mutants hae been isolated using EMS as a mutagen on M
1 seeds, and allyl alcohol selection on M 2 germinating seeds. Mutants
were obtained at a frequency of 9 x 10E-5; 11 ADH mutants were
selected for the race Be-O and 21 for the race Ts-1. Mutant R001 to
R011 (Be-0 background) were further analyzed at the genetic and
biochemical level. Some of the mutants were shown to contain an
inactive protein, still capable of forming active heterodimers with
with the wild type enzyme in hetrozygotes. The mutants were subdivided
into three classes on the basis of the formation of cross reacting
material (CRM0 using immunological techniques. Western blotting and
rocket immunoelectrophoresis indicated that some of the mutants did
not form any ADH like polypeptides (CRM-), some of them produced an
inactive protein at a slightly lower or equal amount than the wild
type (CRM+). The third class showed a very low amount of CRM,
probably unstable or degraded proteins (CRM+/-). Northern blot
hybridization showed good agreement with the results at protein level.
Restriction enzyme analysis could not reveal any differences at DNA
level between the mutants. The isolation of the mutant gene for some
of the mutants has been accomplished and the characterization of the
mutation at the sequence level is now in progress.<p>
