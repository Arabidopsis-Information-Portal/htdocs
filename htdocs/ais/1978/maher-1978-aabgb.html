<h2>2, 4-D RESISTANT MUTANTS</h2><p>

We have previously described the isolation of a mutant (83) which has
increased resistance to 2,4-dichlorophenoxy-acetic acid, an altered
geotropic response of its roots and an increased rate of root growth
(Maher, 1977).<p>

This combination of characteristics raises some interesting questions.
For many years it was believed that indoleacetic acid (IAA), the
naturally occurring counterpart of 2, 4-D, was the regulatory molecule
involved in the geotropic response of roots. This would appear to tie
in well with the properties of the mutant because a lesion which, for
example, decreased endogenous levels of IAA might be expected to
increase 2, 4-D resistance and alter the geotropic response. However,
more recently the role of IAA in root geotropism has been questioned
and there is now strong evidence that the response is mediated by the
inhibitor abscisic acid (ABA) which is produced in the root cap and
transported to the lower half of horizontally placed roots (Wilkins,
1976).<p>

We have tested the effects of these growth regulators on both wildtype
and mutant root growth. Table 1 shows the concentrations of each
compound which give 50% inhibition of root growth in our previously
described system. Also included are the related herbicides,
4-chloro-2-methylphenoxy-acetic acid (MCPA) and 2, 4,
5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4, 5-T).<p>

The table shows that similar levels of 2,4-D and IAA inhibit the
wildtype, but the mutant has appeciable resistance to both compounds.
On the other hand, there is only a marginal difference between
wildtype and mutant in inhibitory concentrations of ABA. It would be
of particular interest to measure the endogenous levels of these
compounds in wildtype and mutant roots to see if they correlate with
the data in Table 1.<p>

herbicides which give 50% inhibition of seedling root growth in
dosage-response curves.<p>

A difference is also found in the effects of the three phenoxyacetic
acid herbicides. While 2, 4-D and MCPA work at similar concentrations
and are resisted strongly by the mutant 2, 4, 5-T requires higher
concentrations to be inhibitory and the mutant only shows a 2.2 fold
increase in resistance.<p>

While the characterization of mutant 83 continues, we are also
extending our range of 2,4-D resistant mutants induced with
ethylmethane sulphonate. To date we have twenty-six mutants which were
isolated in M2 and which displayed some level of resistance to 2, 4-D
in M3. Of these the majority appear to be like 83 with similar levels
of resistance and altered geotropic responses. Among the remainder are
types with lower levels of resistance but apparently normal geotropic
responses and one M3 family which is segregating very highly resistant
seedlings.<p>

We have also looked for naturally occurring resistance to 2, 4-D in
different geographical races of Arabidopsis. We have screened over 70
races (seed originally supplied by Prof. Kranz) but have found only
one, Ts-7, from Spain, which shows any appreciable difference to our
standard Landsberg strain with a 1.4 fold increase in resistance.<p>
