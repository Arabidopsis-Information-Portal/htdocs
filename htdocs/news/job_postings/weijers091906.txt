VACANCY FOR PhD STUDENT

 

 

 

A PhD student position is available to study cell communication and cell specification in the 
plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Our group focuses on the early events that lead to the formation of 
the root meristem (stem cell population) in the embryo of Arabidopsis. Recently we have found that 
root meristem initiation depends on the communication between different cells in the young embryo, 
and we have identified key transcription factors that regulate this process (Weijers et al., 
EMBO J. 2005; Dharmasiri et al., Dev. Cell, 2005; Weijers et al., Dev. Cell, 2006; Weijers and Jürgens, 
Curr. Opin. Plant Biol., 2005). The position is available to investigate the mechanism of this cell 
communication using a combination of genetic, molecular biological and biochemical approaches.

Our laboratory is situated in the Biochemistry laboratory of Wageningen University which offers 
state-of-the-art facilities for proteomics and advanced microscopy including live cell imaging. 
Our group has intensive contacts with other local, national and international laboratories. The 
successful candidate will be enrolled in the graduate school Experimental Pant Sciences which 
offers an attractive curriculum of courses, workshops and symposia.

 

Candidates with MSc or equivalent degree and background in biochemistry, molecular biology or 
genetics are encouraged to apply. The position is for 4 years, is available immediately and 
payment is according to Dutch standards. Further information can be found at the following websites:
