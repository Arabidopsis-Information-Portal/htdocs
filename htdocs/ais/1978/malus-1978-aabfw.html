In previous experiments (Ledoux et al., 1974, 1975) conditional lethal
mutants of Arabidopsis deficient in the thimaine pathway, were
corrected by treatment with purified DNA extracted from thi+ bacteria.
When DNA was destroyed by DNase or when it was prepared from thi-
bacteria, no correction could be observed. As indicated in a short
report, Feenstra et al. (1973) failed to obtain DNA-induced correction
with mutants blocked in the synthesis of the pyrimidine moiety of
thiamine. We decided to check the reproducibility of the correction
phenomenons with py (V 131) mutants obtained from Prof. Feenstra.
These EMS induced mutants are very stable: no revertant was observed
among 87 x 10 3 EMS-treated mutants (Van den Berg et al., 1967)<p>

In our experiments a total of 1340 seeds were treated with 1 mg/ml
sterile DNA purified from E. coli (thi+), at 27*degrees* in alternate
light (10.000 lux - 16 hrs.) and dark (8 hrs.). After 3 days, they
were washed in sterile water and sown in test tubes containing sterile
agar and mineral medium.<p>

Mutants rapidly died as plants grown from 4800 seeds treated with
DNase-treated DNA or 0.01 M Na Cl. 21 DNA-treated plants survived and,
after 6 weeks, formed a normal rosette of leaves. The plants were then
transferred to 21*degrees*C (same photoperiod) to ensure the
production of fertile pods. In these conditions, DNA-corrected plants
produced 200 - 300 seeds, contrary to those we previously obtained
under continuous illumination at 24*degrees*C, which only gave 10-20
seeds per plant (Ledoux et al., 1974, 1975).<p>

The corrected plants presented the expected side markers "erecta" and
"glabrous". They showed variegations, alternation of white and green
segments on the stem and limited growth (+/- 6 cm), all symptoms which
were later proven to be associated with a persistant partial py
deficiency (thiazole was ineffective in restoring normal growth,
contrary to pyrimidine or thiamine). The genetic analysis of three
corrected plants (090, 091, 092) has been initiated by following the
germination and growth of all members of their progenies at
211*degrees*C under discontinuous illumination. Results obtained by
selfing or outcrossing these plants will be described later. We shall
only deal here with the direct progeny of these 3 corrected mutants.<p>

A total of 576 seeds from 55 pods were obtained from the different
stems; 090 (1 stem), 091 (3 stems) and 092 (4 stems). Among the 55
investigated pods, 7 were sterile, 27 gave seeds which either did not
germinate or produced mutant genotypes, 21 pods produced growing
plants, which distributed themselves into 4 groups:<p>

Group I: mutant type dying in 2-3 weeks time. Group II: leaves grow
green, then bleach in 4-6 months. Some of these plants produce short
and deformed stems with small and sterile pods. Group III: leaves grow
green, then bleach. New leaves then appear, green and larger than
normal. They slowly multiply and after 5-7 months green stems (+/- 10
cm) are produced, with fertile pds. Group IV: leaves appear and remain
green. The size of the rosette resembles that of the py-supplemented
mutant. Green stems and fertile pods are obtained after 3-4 months.<p>

The distribution of these 4 groups among the progenies of the 3
corrected plants tested is the following (in p.c.):<p>

On this basis, it can be concluded that the DNA treatment leads to
corrected plants with a chimerical structure.<p>

The diversity of phenotypes found in the present experimental
conditions might reflect a lower strength of the selective pressure
and correspond perhaps to differential expression (and sometimes loss)
of the partial phenotypic correction induced by bacterial DNA.<p>

No mechanical contamination (Redei et al., 1977) can be advocated in
these experiments which confirm the possibility to obtain DNA-mediated
correction of Arabidopsis pyrimidine mutants.<p>
