INTRODUCTION<p>

When estimating the frequencies of induced mutations in plants it is
necessary to find a true correlation between the unknown value - the
number of mutations (M), arising in initial cells of the reproductive
meristem and the registered indices of the mutation process - the
frequency of mutant plants (ma) or fruits (mb), and the frequency of
mutant in M 2-generation (mc). One of the most important factors that
is necessary to take into consideration when finding the relationships
between M and ma, mb or mc, is the chimerism of M 1-generation,<p>

It is generally considered in mutagenesis that the number of initial
cells is not dependent on the mutagenic dose, and the tissue from
which individual fruits or seeds are formed is not chimeric. Then the
following correlations are used for estimation of mutation frequency
(Moller, 1965; Ivanov, 1974):<p>

where f is a fraction of mutants in M 2, N is the average number of
initial cells in a given species, and N is independent on mutagenic
dose.<p>

These propositions, however, are not always fulfilled in concrete
experiments (Gaul, 1960; Balkema, 1971; Usmanov et al., 1980;
Shevchenko and Grinikh, 1981) and that leads to various artefacts in
analysing the data on mutagenesis. We showed in particular that the
groundless application of formula (1) is one of the main causes of the
maximum of the "dose-effect" curve (Usmanov et al., 1980). In this
report we will try - on experimental data obtained after ethylene
imine (EI) treatment of Arabidopsis seeds - primarily to show the
inadequacy of traditional ideas on the structure of chimeric plants
used in the interpretation of mutagenic experiments, and secondarily
to point out a possible approach to the construciton of true estimates
of frequencies of induced mutations in higher plants.<p>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<p>

Air-dry seeds of Arabidopsis, race Enkheim, were treated with 3
different concentrations of aqueous solution of ethylene imine (EI)
during 18 hours at 18*degrees*C, then the seeds were washed for 1 hour
in running water. The treated seeds were put into vegetative boxes
with soil.<p>

The registration of the arising mutations was carried out by the
"embryo-test" (Moller, 1963). First 10 pods from the top of the
inflorescence were analysed; mutations of "albina", "xantha",
"chlorina" classes were registered. The mutation frequency was
calculated according to formulae (1-2)k the average number of initital
cells (N ic) - according to formula (4):<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol19/vol19-pg80-fig0.gif">Click here for figure</a><p>

where B m is the number of pods with mutations, B is the number of
pods on the mutant plants. When calculating M and N ic we used the
number of mutated pods and not of embryos, in order to avoid the
influence of possible deficiency of mutant homozygotes.<p>

Table 1: Results of an analysis of mutation data obtained after the
treatment of seeds of Arabidopsis with different concentrations of
ethylene imine (EI).<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

Table 1 shows experimental data and values of M and N ic obtained. At
high confidence level (P<0.001) the average number of initial cells
decreases with the increase of EI-dosage. At maximum and minimum
concentrations of EI, N ic significantly differed from 2. According to
the data obtained, in intact plants the N ic value for top
inflorescence is approaching 3 (Table 1.)<p>

Let us consider now the problem of pod chimerism. In achimeric pods
the part of mutnt embryos is about 1/4, and in chimeric ones it ranges
from 1/4 to 1/16. Therefore, if a portion of pods is chimeric, then
the fraction of the mutant embryos in the pods withi mutations must be
below 1/4.<p>

In the experiment held the fraction of mutant embryos in the pods with
mutations did not differ significantly at different concentrations of
EI, and in average it was equal to 0.227, which differs from 0.250
with P > 0.99 (Table 1). This cannot yet serve as the evidence of
presence of chimeric pods because the mutant deficiency can be
explained by their high mortality. However, if we compare the
segregation in pods separately for chimeric and achimeric plants, we
will see, that in the first case the fraction of mutant embryos is
0.208 and in the second 0.263. Since these values differ significantly
(P< 0.001) and in chimeric plants the segregation does not differ from
3:1, then the presence of chimeric pods is the only cause of the
mutant deficiency in chimeric plants.<p>

Supposing there is panmixia inside the chimeric flower, the fraction
of chimeric pods (x) can be estimated by the equation:<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol19/vol19-pg83-fig0.gif">Click here for figure</a><p>

where P is the frequency of mutant embryos in the pods with mutations
and then<p>

In our example P = 0.208 and x = 0.22, which is very close to the
value obtained by the independent method of Balkema (1971).<p>

Figure 1: Influence of the number of initial cells on the character of
"dose-effect" curve.<p>

The effect of mutagen dosage on changing the average number of initial
cells is distinctly seen in Figure 1. "Dose-effect" curves plotted
according to m a and m b value differ sharply if N ic is accepted to
be independent of EI-dose (and equals 2); these curves almost coincide
if N ic for each concentration is calculated according to the formula
(4). If we use N ic value as a constant in the formula (1) the
relative mutagen efficiency (mutation frequency per dose unit) becomes
overestimated for low doses and underestimated for high doses for
Arabidopsis real values of M can differ from those calculated by 1.5
to 3 times. These results are analogous to results obtained earlier
(Usmanov et al., 1980) and prove that when calculating the mutation
frequency according to the fraction of mutant families it is necessary
to find the N ic value for each dose.<p>

The availability of chimeric pods also makes for mistakes in the
process of finding the M-value, as it changes m b, m c, and N ic
values. Relative mistakes for m b do not surpass (x/2) and for m c they
are no more than (-3x/2) (x is the fraction of chimeric pods among all the
pods with mutations). Relative mistakes for N ic are equal to mistakes
for m b or m c (according to which index N ic is calculated). With the
increase of dosage these mistakes decrease owing to the increase of
the fraction of achimeric plants. In the present experiment relative
mistakes for M decresed from 10 to 2 percent, that does not
practically make for misrepresentation in the "dose-effect" curves. As
the mistakes for Arabidopsis are not substantial, the chimerism of
pods can be neglected, but for other species a different situation may
arise.<p>

If it is necessary to find the N ic value for every dose when
calculating M according to m a, a conclusion suggests itself that it
is more convenient to use m b and m c values. It must be taken into
account, however, that according to the frequency of mutant pods or
embryos we get only an approximate (although not removed) estimation
of the fraction of mutated initial cells from those which have
undergone the mutagenic treatment. Using m a and N ic values we get an
exact value of the frequency of mutated initial cells in the
investigated complex. Therefore, in spite of the widespread opinion,
we get the more exact M value using formula (1) than if we use
formulae (2) and (3) (Table 1). Furthermore, in order to calculate the
averge mistake of M it is necessary to know the size of the sampling,
e.g., the number of initial cells, that have undergone mutagenic
treatment. Therefore, although the N ic value is not used when
calculating M according to formulae (2) and (3), it is still necessary
for finding confidence intervals of this value.<p>

Thus irrespective of what index is supposed to be used for finding the
M value - m a, m b, or m c - it is necessary to estimate N ic for each
dose. Therefore, in experimental mutagenesis of plants we should base
ourselves on the m a index, which allows to get the most exact
estimation of the mutation frequency and use m b and m c values only
when M values are great and "dose-effect" curve for m a is close to
going out onto the plateau.<p>

In conclusion there is an observation on the experimental estimation
of the N ic value. With the increase of mutation frequency a fraction
of plants grows with phenotypically indistinguishable mutations
arising in several initial cells. This inevitably leads to a seemingly
more rapid decrease of the N ic value with the increases of dosage,
then it really takes place. It is very difficult to take into account
the arising mistake for it is necessary to know only the average value
of the number of intiital cells, but also a frequency of the occurence
of plants with 1, 2, 3, etc. initial cells. Therefore, for estimation
of the N ic value at high values of M for practical needs it is
necessary to choose the type of mutations, the frequency of which at
the given dose does not rise above 10-15%. The calculation shows that
at such a frequency of mutation the mistakes in finding N ic are small
and in most cases they can be neglected.<p>

SUMMARY<p>

The results of this investigation and the previous one (Usmanov et
al., 1980) show, that when treating seeds of Arabidopsis with ethylene
imine, the average number of initial cells decreases with the dose's
increase. Apparently the similar effect must be true for other
mutagens and species. Therefore it is necessary to find the dependence
of the number of initial cells on dosage when estimating the effect of
mutagens on plants. Neglecting this dependence may lead to the
distortion of "dose-effect" curve and to the arising of various
artefacts; the msot striking of which is the "phenomenon of maximum
and minimum of mutations". At the same time it is shown that the
chimerism of pods does not bring in considerable mistakes into the
estimation of M.<p>

When comparing different methods of estimation of mutation frequencies
in plants it is shown that irrespective of the chosen index of the
mutation process in every case the estimation of the N ic-value is
necessary. Therefore, the estimation of mutation frequencies should be
based on m a values, as the estimation of M here is the most exact
one, and only when M values are very great, m b or m c values should
be used.<p>
