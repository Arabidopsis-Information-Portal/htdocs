Job Announcement follows:

TAIR, The Arabidopsis Information Resource (http://arabidopsis.org) is a 
National Science Foundation-funded web resource for thousands of plant 
biology researchers worldwide, providing free access to a wide array of 
biological data and analysis tools for the model plant Arabidopsis. TAIR 
is located at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, Department of 
Plant Biology in Stanford, CA.

We are currently seeking applicants for the position of scientific 
curator to work on our genomic sequence annotation project. As part of 
the TAIR team you will be involved in computational and manual updates 
of structural annotation for genes and other sequenced objects and 
computational updates of functional annotation. You will also work 
alongside software and database developers to enhance annotation tools 
and assess the automatic analysis procedure.

Responsibilities include:

1. Assisting with timely and high-quality genome annotation releases.

2. Improving the structural annotation database schema and associated 
computational tools and analyses in collaboration with programmers and 
database developers.

3. Assisting in developing improved formats and methods for community 
access to TAIR genome releases.

4. Presenting TAIR's structural and functional annotation efforts at 
conferences, soliciting community feedback and incorporating it into 
future releases.

5. Working with programmers to maintain and improve pipelines for 
mapping a variety of sequenced objects (cDNAs, ESTs, polymorphisms, 
markers, microarray elements, etc) to the genome.

6. Helping maintain TAIR's data analysis datasets and assisting with 
keeping the data analysis tools (BLAST, FASTA, PatMatch, etc) functioning.

7. Assisting with implementing improvements to TAIR's genome browser 
(SeqViewer) and map comparison tool (MapViewer).

Requirements:
 
Ph.D. degree or equivalent in biological research involving DNA or 
protein sequence analysis. You must have a keen eye for detail, a 
demonstrated ability for independent critical thinking, excellent 
communication and computer literacy skills.

Experience in computational biology, sequence analysis, comparative 
genome analysis, or computational prediction of gene structure or function.

Experience of UNIX, MYSQL and perl would be beneficial but is not required.

Qualified candidates should email a resume to David Swarbreck at:
dswarbreck@acoma.stanford.edu

The preferred starting date is September, 2006.
The Carnegie Institution of Washington is an equal opportunity employer.
