About 1.100 seeds of three races (early race BP 4-1, middle-early ract
ST 56, and late race Zb 25) were treated by the 0,2 mM solution of
methylnitrosourea at 25*degrees*C during 24 hours.  The control was
analogously made in distilled water.  The M1-populations were
cultivated in the green-house at 12-20*degrees*C.  The M2-populations
were sown by 20 seeds from various M1-plants and cultivated under
continuous illumination (200 Lux) at 24 +2,5*degrees*C.  The
experiments with the early and middle-early races were finished after
30 days, the experiments with the late race after 66 days.  The
results are given in the following table:<p>

The given changes in the earliness show on the average a trend to
lower the number of days which are needed for the transition to the
generative stage, especially in the late race Zb 25; the number of
leaves is even lower here.  The within races variance of the M2 as
compared with the control increases significantly.<p>

The percentage of plants remaining after 30 or 66 days in the
vegetative stage increases in the M2 in all three races.  The
difference between the M2 and the control is significant, too.  The
experiments are being continued.<p>
