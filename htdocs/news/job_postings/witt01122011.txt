PhD fellowships starting Fall 2011 
The University of Cologne has a long-standing tradition and world-wide 
reputation for top-level molecular biological research. Beginning in Fall 
2011 we offer: 

PhD fellowships from the International Graduate School in Development Health 
and Disease 

The participating research groups use microbial, plant and animal model 
systems to investigate cell biological and genetic mechanisms whose 
perturbation during the life cycle of an organism results in disease. 
The three-year programme starts with a six-month rotation and course period, 
followed by a PhD project in one of the participating groups. Seminars and 
training courses complement the research work. Comprehensive support is 
provided throughout the programme. The programme language is English. 
Accepted students will receive a laptop computer and 500 EUR to get started 
in Cologne. No tuition fees are charged.
