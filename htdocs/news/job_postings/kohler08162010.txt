Postdoctoral positions in Epigenetics and Plant Speciation 
Köhler laboratory, SLU Uppsala, Sweden 

Two postdoctoral positions are available in the Köhler lab to study the molecular bases of ploidy
mediated plant speciation in Arabidopsis and related species. 

The Köhler lab will move to the SLU Uppsala in October and we are looking for highly motivated
individuals to join a young group and a research project aimed at understanding the underlying 
molecular mechanisms of polyploidy mediated plant speciation. The positions are open to enthusiastic 
individuals with a strong record of scientific productivity. Applicants should have a solid 
background in molecular biology and genetics; skills and interest in bioinformatics are desired but 
not essential. Candidates with a strong interest in epigenetics are especially encouraged to apply. 

Applicants should send their CV, a description of their research experience and interest, and the 
names and addresses of 2-3 references by e-mail to Claudia Köhler (koehlerc@ethz.ch).
