TAIR, The Arabidopsis Information Resource -- http://arabidopsis.org -- is a National Science Foundation-funded 
web resource for thousands of plant biology researchers worldwide, providing free access to a wide array of 
biological data and analysis tools for the model plant Arabidopsis, including the first and most complete 
multicellular eukaryotic genome sequence. 

We are looking for a Database Administrator to support internal and production mission-critical Sybase and 
MySQL databases. Initially, the primary focus will be on assisting with the migration in-house of a set of 
large, complex Sybase databases from a subcontractor. In addition to DBA responsibilities, the preferred 
candidate will be capable of wearing multiple hats and could provide at least backup-level system administration 
support for our Solaris / Linux infrastructure and production environment. 

Responsibilities: 

- Provide primary database support for the in-house migration of a set of large, complex, mission-critical 
Sybase 12.x databases on the Solaris SPARC platform. Learn the schema in detail (interacting with subcontractor 
staff as necessary), create and maintain in-house instances of the database (including specifying the physical 
structure), load the database from dump files, troubleshoot and tune the database, etc. 

- Develop information storage requirements with internal users. 

- Implement and deploy databases that are correct, reliable, secure, and high performing. Monitor databases 
on an ongoing basis. 

- Devise high-availability strategies for databases (backup and restore procedures, mirroring, replication, etc.). 

- Provide expert support for existing database schemas and instances, including routine administrative and 
24x7 production support. 

- Install and upgrade DBMS and OS software as needed. 

- Write extensive documentation on database schemas and instance support. 

- Provide at least backup-level system administration support when needed. Technologies used by TAIR 
include Linux (Red Hat), Solaris, Apache, Tomcat, Macromedia JRun, NFS, Perl, and Python. 

Requirements: 

- BS in Computer Science / Management Information Systems or equivalent experience. 
- At least three years of experience designing and managing complex Sybase 12.x databases. 
- At least one year of experience designing and managing MySQL 4 databases. 
- Willingness to support production databases 24x7. 
- Knowledge of / interest in plant biology strongly desirable. 
- Ability to lift and carry computer equipment (minimum 50 lbs.). 
- Ability to assemble and connect computer equipment. 
- Ability to interact, work cooperatively, and communicate with coworkers.
