PhD Student Position (Bioinformatics & genomics)

Genetics & Biotechnology Lab, University College Cork (UCC), 
Ireland

The Genetics & Biotechnology lab of Dr. Charles Spillane at 
University College Cork, Ireland is seeking candidates for a PhD in 
bioinformatics and systems biology of large-genomic datasets. The 
successful applicant will form part of a team (postdocs, PhD students) 
in the lab working on a combination of bioinformatic, systems biology 
and functional wet-lab approaches for understanding gene regulatory 
systems involving genomic imprinting and gene dosage. The PhD 
student will also interface extensively with collaborator labs outside 
Ireland. We are seeking highly motivated applicants with consistently 
excellent grades (ideally to MSc level), who are eager to develop a 
long-term career in genome bioinformatics and/or computational 
systems biology. We are particularly interested in candidates with an 
excellent grasp of genetics, statistics and computer programming 
(Python, R, Bioconductor, SQL, UNIX/LINUX), who have 
bioinformatics research experience (e.g. as RAs, MSc/diploma 
students, interns, etc) in research lab/institute settings, and are 
experienced in efficiently handling multiple large data-sets.

Applicants should send an e-mail outlining research interest and 
motivations, including; (a) your C.V.  (list grades, interests and 
experimental skills) & (b) contact details and e-mail addresses for 3 
referees to:

Dr. Charlie Spillane, Genetics & Biotechnology Lab, Biochemistry 
Dept & Biosciences Institute, University College Cork, LM 2.10, Cork, 
Ireland. E-mail: c.spillane@ucc.ie

The deadline for applications is 10th July 2009 or until suitable 
candidate is recruited.
