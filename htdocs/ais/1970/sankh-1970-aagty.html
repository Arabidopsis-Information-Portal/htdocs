Growth retardants (CCC, phosfon, B-nine, AMO 1618 etc.)  apparently
resemble morphactins in their overall growth retarding property
(SCHNEIDER, 1964; CATHEY, 1964.  However, morphactins, unlike growth
retardants (NINNEMAN et al., 1964) do not affect GA biosynthesis
(TOGNONI et al., 1967) and are known to disturb phototropism and
geotropism of plant organs (KHAN, 1967; SANKHLA and SANKHLA, 1968).
Recently, we have observed that morphactin induced formation of
polypetalous flowers in snapdragon, reverses the original compound
leaf to simple leaf in Ipomea, selectively inhibits formation of
vessels in Petunia, inhibits tendril formation and alters leaf
morphology in Momordica and modifies the flower sex in Nicotiana in a
manner similar to auxin and growth retardants (SANKHLA, 1969 and
unpublished data).  The present report describes our results relating
to the effect of CCC, morphactin (M), and gibberellin (GA) on growth
and development of Arabidopsis.<p>

Table: (1) Length of plant (mm), (2) fresh weight and (3) dry weight
(mg) after 4 weeks, (4) number of lateral branches, (5) number of
'secondary rosette' leaves, (6) flowering after days, (7) number and
(8) size of fruit after 35 days.<p>

Plants of A. thaliana, race En-2, were raised in the greenhouse and
treated with the desired concentration (Table) of CCC-, M-, and GA
solutions. From the results presented in the table it appears that
both CCC and M. have profound effects on growth and development of
Arabidopsis plants. With an increase in the concentration of M a
decrease was observed in the extension growth, fresh weight and dry
weight of the treated plants.  Also till the effect of the chemical
persisted, the flowering was delayed considerably and the number and
size of fruits was greatly reduced.  However, later on because of the
production of a large number of lateral branches, the treated plants
produced an enormous number of fruits, and also their senescence was
greatly checked.  A unique response to added morphactin was reflected
in the appearance of a large number of lateral branches and production
of many short, hairy, upturned spatula-like 'secondary rosette'
-leaves which frequently developed enormous amounts of an
anthocyanin-like pigment on their morphological lower side.  Although
GA when added simultaneously tended to reverse the effect of
morphactin it always failed in reversing the effect of the latter
chemical on 'secondary rosette' leaves (Figure a and c).  In plants
receiving higher morphactin concentration a few lateral branches
invariably indicated various degrees of fasciations (Figure b) which
also could not be prevented by a simultaneous addition of gibberellin.
It was interesting to note that even after an extreme degree of
fasciation the branches produced normal fruits containing viable seeds
(Figure b).  On a few plants CCC and morphactins were also sprayed
simultaneously (data not shown).  These plants also indicated effects
of both CCC and morphactin, thereby suggesting independent effects of
the two chemicals on growth and development. The exact site of the
action of morphactins is unknown. Several evidences suggest that these
chemicals disturb the polar transport of auxin (KRELLE and LIBBERT,
1967) and possibly also affect the endogenous levels of the known
growth regulators (ZIEGLER, 1968).  Therefore, it appears likely that
these chemicals elicit the characteristic morphogenetic effects by
affecting the overall modulation of endogenous growth regulators in
such a way that the smooth running of an 'endogenous growth regulator
gradient' is prevented (BOPP, 1968)<p>
