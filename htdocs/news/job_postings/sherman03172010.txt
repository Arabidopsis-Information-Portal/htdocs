*Fulbright Israel Post-Doctoral Fellowships for*

*American Researchers in All Academic Disciplines*



The United States-Israel Educational Foundation (USIEF), the Fulbright
commission for Israel, offers 10 fellowships to American post-doctoral
researchers in support of work to be carried out at Israeli universities
during the course of the 2011/2012-2012/2013 academic years.



The US Post-Doctoral Fellowship Program is open to candidates in all
academic disciplines.



Program grants total $40,000, $20,000 per academic year.



Program fellows must be accepted as post-doctoral researchers by Israeli
host institutions, which agree to provide them with a standard post-doctoral
grant, which they will receive in addition to their Fulbright Fellowship.
Thus, the total financial support received by Program Fellows is likely to
be in the range of at least $35,000-$40,000 per year.



Applications for 2011/2012-2012/2013 Fulbright Post-Doctoral Fellowships
must be submitted to the Council for International Exchange of Scholars by
August 2, 2010.
