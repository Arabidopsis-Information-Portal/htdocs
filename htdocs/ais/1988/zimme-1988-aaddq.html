ABSTRACT<p>

In this study we present first results of an Advanced Biostack
experiment performed during Biokosmos 8-space flight aboard Kosmos
1887. For the first time the combined effect of space vacuum,
microgravity and cosmic radiation on seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana has
been studied. Data obtained show relative good vitality, although
particular cosmic radiation damages are obtained evidently induced by
individual heavy ions.<p>

INTRODUCTION<p>

Because of the different flight and material exposition data,
comparison of the results obtained by the Biokosmos 8 and Spacelab 1
(SL-1) experiment (Kranz, 1986) is intresting. The initial orbital
parameter of Kosmos 1887 were period 90,5 min, apogee 406 km, prigee
224 km and inclination 62.8 degrees. Comparative data for SL-1 were
altitude 241 km, inclination 57 degrees. Flight duration was 13 days
for Kosmos 1887 and 10 days for SL-1.<p>

With respect to the exposition of the biological material we have to
consider that one Biostack-unit has been exposed to free space on the
surface of the Biokosmos 8. Similar exposition to free space was
already performed on the pallet of SL-1 shuttle. On the contrary, the
seed material of Biokosmos 8 was exposed to space vacuum,
additionally. For comparison a second unit was positioned inside the
Kosmos satellite of which similar conditions to the inside stacks of
SL-1 can be supposed.<p>

MATERIAL AND METHODS<p>

The construction of the Biostack and the details of stacking procedure
have been reported elsewhere (Bucker et al., 1984). We used seeds from
the genetic line En-2 (AIS access. no. 2018) as test subjects. The
seeds were fastened with Luviskol VA64 (10g in 100 ml of ehtanol 50%)
to Cellulosenitrate (CN)-sheets. These CN-sheets show after etching
the tracks of densely ionizing HZE-particles (Z>2).<p>

In this report we consider only sheets from the outside Biostack unit.
Compared to the inside unit, for this unit we have to consider
additional space environment factors besides decreased cosmic
radiation shielding, deep or increased temperature, and last not least
vacuum. Furthermore, flight conditions were incompletely controlled
during launch and landing. In the time of reentry a temperature
maximum at 82 to 100*degrees*C occured for about 1-2 mins at the
Biostack unit. The landing took place 3000 km far away in NE-direction
from the designed position; the sample stayed there for about 10 min
at -25*degrees*C. After saving the material the temperature remained
above +10*degrees*C (pers. communication of Soviet authorities).<p>

Control experiments started 14 days later. In the meantime, the sheets
covered with seeds were stored in an exsiccator with silica gel.
General vitality (seed germination) was tested on a modified
Redei-medium (Redei, 1965) consolidated with agar in order to find out
the prevalent condition fo the flown seed samples. For this test we
examined always the same number of 150 seeds per treatment as follows:<p>

1. FC fresh-control, original sample of AIS-seed bank<p>

2. C control, fastened with luviskol, but not stacked, stored by DFVLR
at Cologne<p>

3. BC backup-control, fastened and stacked, stored by IBMP at Moscow<p>

4. FI flight-control, flight-unit from inside stack<p>

5.  flight-control, flight-unit from outside stack.<p>

The distance of particle tracks from the biological objects (impact
parameter) was measured with an improved microscope equipped for
micropositioning (Bork and Kranz, 1983). In earlier experiments we
utilized a step motor driven table for micropositioning with steps of
one micron; in this investigation an improved system with a resolution
of 0,15 micro m was used. We measured HZE-tracks next to single seeds,
and the marked shape limits of the seeds; the controlling computer
estimated the position of the embryonic meritems.<p>

The measured seeds were removed with a moistened brush and transferred
to Eppendorf tubes which were stored in an exsiccator dried with
silica gel. The seeds for which individual impact parameters had been
determined (FLHZE) were sown on Gelrite-medium, adapted to mineral and
nutrient conditions (composition of nutrient medium per liter bidist
water: NH 4 NO 3 200 mg; MgSO 4 x 7H 20 500 mg; CaH 4 (PO 4) 2 x H 2 0
100 mg; KH 2 PO 4 100 mg; K 2 HPO 4 50 mg; FeC 6 H 5 0 7 x 3H 2 0
ferricitrate 2,5 mg; HC1-hydrolysate 1000 mg; dexrose 20 g; Gelrite
gellan gum 5 g). The seeds were individually transfered 6 days after
germination to plastic pots with standard soil (loam or
compost/peat/sand 8:2:1 v/v/v). For comparison we used following
control samples:<p>

1. FLC flight-control: Seeds from FO-sheets without nearby HZE-tracks<p>

2. BC backup-control: see above<p>

3. FC fresh-control: see above<p>

In order to evaluate the HZE-induced radiation damage, we investigated
the following biological endpoints of early and later onto genetic
appearance: germination rate, seedling vitality, morphological
aberrations (cotyledon defect, radicle damage, abnormal shoot), flower
development and embryo vitaltity of pods (adapted embryo test from
Muller, 1963).<p>

RESULTS<p>

General vitality test<p>

In order to obtain information on the survival, we tested at first the
prevalent after flight condition of the objects via germination
ability of seeds placed inside and outside the satellite in comparison
with stacked and non-stacked control seeds without any consideration
of HZE-tracks. The results of the germination test are shown in Figure
1. Seed germination of the flight samples (FI., FO) was reduced. After
72 hours the difference between germination frequency of control seeds
(FC, BC, C) and of the flight samples (FO) was 10-20%. Germination of
outside flight samples was lower than germination of inside flight
samples (FI).<p>

test.<p>

Seed germination and flower development of control samples<p>

For this evaluation we performed an additional vitality test a few
weeks later in which the seedlings were transferred to standard soil
after germination.<p>

Figure 2A shows the courses of seed germination. We compared total
rates, i.e., percentage of germinated seeds, and the dynamics of
germination. Whereas the germination rate of fresh control (FC) and
backup control (BC) reached again over 90%, only about 50% of the
flight control seeds germinated. Also the dynamics of germination
showed a distinct decrease for the flight control. The difference
between the fresh control and the backup control was not significant,
but also noticeable.<p>

Afterwards, we counted the plants with open flowers. Observation of
the flowering development showed no significant difference between
fresh control and backup control (Figure 2B). Only the flight control
showed again a delay of development.<p>

Radiation damage of seeds with HZE-tracks nearby<p>

In the third part of our experiment we investigated the development of
seeds with individual HZE-tracks nearby. We compared individual seeds
with the smallest impact parameters so far obtained to the root
meristem or shoot meristem of both experiments (SL-1 and Biokosmos 8).
For this evaluation we used seeds from outside sheets only (Table 1).
Those facts show that in almost all cases impact parameters of about
less than 100 micro m cause severe early or late damage.<p>

Arabidopsis with the smallest impact parameters so far obtained.<p>

Finally we applied Muller's embryonic test. We compared the number of
pods with 100% embryo lethality found in plants grown from seeds with
HZE-tracks nearby (FLHZE) with those from control samples (FC, BC,
FLC). The t s-test (Sokal and Rohlf, 1969) assures high significant
difference. There is no significant difference between the controls
(BC and both FC and FLC; cf. Table 2).<p>

DISCUSSION<p>

The general vitality test illustrates the influence of space
conditions on germination ability of seeds. Generally, the germination
rate of flight samples (FI and FO) was lower than the rate of control
samples. Moreover, the FO-samples germinated lower than FI. We cannot
compare these results with the results from SL-1, because the
definition of "outside flight samples" is different. While the
"outside samples" of SL-1 were hermetically enclosed in a Biostack
unit positioned on the pallet, the Biokosmos 8 samples were really in
space i.e., positioned in an open Biostack unit. Furthermore, there
was no significant difference between inside and outside samples in
the SL-1 experiment (Kranz, 1986). The results of the additional
germination test showed that BC and FLC did not germinate as good as
the FC. The difference between BC and FC was not so evident, but
noticeable. An influence of adhesive Luviskol VA 64 could be
conceived. Furthermore, we cannot exclude an influence of the
transport to Moscow and back to Cologne/Frankfurt. The evaluation of
flowering supplies no significant difference between FC and BC.
However, the FLC was delayed in flowering development. This seems to
be an effect of cosmic radiation; the delay of germination has to be
considered too.<p>

The comparison of individual impact parameters between the experiments
of Biokosmos 8 and of SL-1 showed nearly the same tendency of results.
HZE-particles with low impact parameters to root- or shoot-meristem
can and mostly do cause severe damages, noticeable as early
seedlings-lethality or sublethality and late embryo-lethality.
Additionally, there are also plans with minor damage like cotyledon
defect and radicle damage. This indicates, that the radiation damage
is not only dependent on smnall impact parameters, but also on the
kind of ions, their energy transfer and their individual way of
trespassing the seed (Bork et al., 1988).<p>

Comparing data of Kosmos 1887 and SL-1, we observe more lethal seeds
for Biokosmos 8. A reason might be the longer duration and higher
altitude of Biokosmos 8 space flight in relation to SL-1 as mentioned
above.<p>

The Muller embryonic test (cf. Table 2) showed that plants of control
samples (FC, BC, FLC) formed no or only a few sterile pods, while
FLHZE plants grown from HZE-hit seeds yielded a significantly
increased frequency of individuals with highly sterile pods. Of
course, those pods with 100% lethal embryos were the cause of dominant
mutations or large deficiencies (e.g., double DNA standbreaks,
chromosomal defects). In this respect, as expected there is no
significant difference in frequency neither between fresh control and
backup control nor between fresh control and flight control.<p>
