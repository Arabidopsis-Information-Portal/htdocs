Optimal conditions for the germination of Arabidopsis pollen are
unknown.  In order to approach this problem and furthermore to detect
differences in germination and pollen tube growth between pollen from
control plants and from certain mutants, the following experiment was
carried out.<p>

Anthers were taken from healthy Arabidopsis plants, grown in
polystyrene dishes in a growth chamber under standard conditions
(CONTANT, 1966), and squashed in Van Tieghem cells to make hanging
drop preparations of a salt solution (BREWBAKER and KWACK, 1963) with
a range of saccharose concentrations (10, 15, 17.5, 20, 25 or 30%) and
with or without the addition of one detached and thoroughly squashed
stigma (from the same plant) per preparation.  Each treatment was done
in dupicate.  BREWBAKER's solution consists of: 300 ppm Ca(NO3)2, 200
ppm MgSO4, 7H20, 100 ppm KNO3 and 100 ppm H3BO3.  The preparations
were incubated at 20*degrees*C in continuous light from Philips TL33RS
fluorescent tubes (12000 lux), and inspected at 5-hour intervals.<p>

Figure 1 shows the germination percentage for each treatment after 20
hours of incubation.  Germinated were considered to be all pollen
grains in which plasma exudes from the germination pore(s), i.e., also
the grains which burst at or shortly after germination. The low
osmotic pressure of the 10 and 15% sugar solutions permitted rapid
water uptake and germination but also led to a high percentage of
bursting pollen.  The addition of a squashed stigma to the medium
induced more rapid pollen germination while also leading to a higher
pecentage of germinating pollen bursting.  This effect caused by the
stigma is probably associated with activity or concentration of
enzymes; this is supported by the very marked effect on pollen tube
growth, shown in Figure 2.  The data demonstrate that for both pollen
germination and pollen tube growth a saccharose concentration of 17.5
- 20% is optimal.  More study is needed to establish whether further
improvements can be made by changing the salt composition and/or total
concentration, and whether this would affect the optimum sugar
concentration.<p>

The second part of the experiment, conducted at a sugar concentration
of 20% with or without the addition of a stigma, aimed at a comparison
of pollen tube growth from control plants and from 9 different
mutants.  All comparisons were made in duplicate, with independent
control samples; in each preparation, 90 - 160 pollen tubes were
measured.  In the preparations without a stigma tube length after 20
hours ranged from 0.3 - 0.6 units; none of the differences were
significant.  In those with a stigma, growth had been very much faster
(3.9 - 4.8 units), except for mutant no. 7 (1.4 units) which was also
the only mutant significantly different from the control (P <0.0001).
The variation between the 18 control samples is a measure of the
reproducibility of the method: x = 4.7 +/- 0.6 units.  It is suggested
that mutant no. 7 possesses a mutation which prohibits the reaction of
its pollen to stimulatory substances from the squashed stigma.  Also
in pollinations in vivo such pollen grains may have a much slower tube
growth, leading to certation of normal pollen were present.
Experimentation with this mutant will be continued, using
UV-fluorescence microscopy to study the growth of pollen tubes within
the style.<p>
