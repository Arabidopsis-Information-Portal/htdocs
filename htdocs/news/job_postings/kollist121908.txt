Post-doctoral opportunities in the Dean group, John Innes Centre, 
Norwich. 
http://www.jic.ac.uk/staff/caroline-dean/research.htm 
 
The Dean group is studying the pathways controlling flowering and 
vernalization in Arabidopsis. New funding from the European Research 
Council will enable a concerted effort to dissect the different phases 
of vernalization: the triggering of FLC silencing by prolonged cold; the 
epigenetic stability of chromatin changes at FLC; and the spatial 
restriction of silencing to FLC. Our goal will be a full understanding 
of the complexity involved in the epigenetic silencing of this locus, 
described in a quantitative model. This work will be done in 
collaboration with Prof. Martin Howard (Computational and Systems 
Biology Department, John Innes Centre - 
http://www.jic.ac.uk/staff/martin-howard/). 
 
EU funds are also available to investigate the overlap between the 
autonomous, RNAi and DNA methylation pathways in mediating epigenetic 
regulation in the Arabidopsis genome and how this is affected by 
different environmental conditions. 
 
We are looking for enthusiastic, motivated individuals who will enjoy 
working on a focused set of problems as part of a team 
(http://www.jic.ac.uk/staff/caroline-dean/people.htm). 
The posts will be available early in 09 and be for 3 years in the first 
instance. Please e-mail expressions of interest to 
caroline.dean@bbsrc.ac.uk detailing previous experience and referees.
