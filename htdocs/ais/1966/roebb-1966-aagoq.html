<h2>Induction of laggards and morphological variants by EMS treatment in different developmental stages of Arabidopsis</h2><p>

	The efficiency of mutagenic agents seems to be dependent not only on the exogenous treatment conditions but also on the endogenous developmental and physiological state of the treated plant material (ROBBELEN, 1962a, 1965a).  Therefore, comparative mutation experiments have been performed with treatment of Arabidopsis seeds and gametes with ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS; for further details cf. ROBBELEN, 1966).<p>

	Seeds (S), presoaked for 15 h, were immersed in 0.5% buffered EMS solution for 12 h at 20*degrees* (cf. ROBBELEN, 1965b).  Direct pollen treatments on wetted filterpaper were futile.  Therefore, inflorescences were treated by making a tongue-slit into their shaft and forcing the mutagen into the buds through the transpiration stream (ROBBELEN 1962b).  The uptake was at least 1 ml of the 0.5% EMS-solution within 12-20 h, according to the given greenhouse conditions.  In particular, ovules (E) were treated in emasculated flowers which afterwards were pollinated with untreated pollen at the time of stigma maturity.  On the other hand pollen (P:) from treated infloruescences was used for fertilizing untreated egg cells.  By parallel karyological investigations it was ascertained that the EMS-treatment was performed furing meiosis in both cases. The M1-plants were normal in growth and only slightly reduced in fertility which in the 3 series ranged between 82 and 85% of the control.  In the M2-generation the frequency of induced seedling mutations (in % of M1-plants) was nearly the same in all three series:   = 39, 6%, E = 35,3% and P = 41,3%.  Thus, for the induction of drastic mutations bud treatment seems to be of no special advantage against the much easier and conventional seed treatment.<p>

	Beside these distinct, monogenically segregating "gross mutants", a comparison of the series S. E and P frequently revealed lethal and viable laggard plants (Figure 1a), as they have earlier been described by BROWN, BHATIA, and SMITH (1965) after thymidine analogue treatment of Arabidopsis buds.  But deviating from the experiments of these authors in our M2 generations even morphological variants appeared in those families containing laggards (Figure 1b).  The characteristic feature of all these three classes was, that there were hardly two plants alike within one family:  The laggards varied extensively with regard to their developmental delay.  The lethals died at the cotyledon stage already 14 days after sowing or gained some tiny primary leaves before death; the viables at 28 days after sowing showed two to six leaves, when the normal plants had already produced 9 to 10 leaves.  The same diversity held for the morphological variants, so that only some rough groups could be classified, e.g., plants with somewhat shorter or narrower leaves, with a more dense rosette etc..  To prove the heredity of these types, a M3 generation was grown from seeds of about 100 individuals of 8 different groups of viable laggards (3) and morphological variants (5).  In no family there were any homozygosity nor clear-cut segregation ratios neither in progenies of laggards nor of  morphological variants.  BROWN, BHATIA, and SMITH (1965) tested their laggards for at least 7 generations and were, nevertheless, unable to stabilize an inbred line, breeding true for the selected phenotype.  They therefore discussed these variant forms in terms of "many genes, heterozygosity, or low penetrance".<p>

	With this in view we were surprised to find the number of such variants increased over the control only in the S and E, but not in the P series (Table 1).  As surely in pollen the cytoplasm contributes less to the progeny, we at first were inclined to attribute the EMS induced variation in the M2 to somatic changes within the cytoplasm, i.e., to "Dauermodifikationen".  But in the M3 generation of morphological variants not only the original M2 plant phenotype, but also in a lower frequency forms were obtained which belong to quite different mutant groups (Table 2).  This speaks in favour of polygenic variation within complex quantitative traits.  It is, no doubt, highly speculative at present to discuss these findings at the level of primary mutagenous mechanisms.  But we are going to continue this kind of experiment with other chemomutagens under varying treatment conditions in order to confirm whether we really treat with a different ratio of gross to small mutations after pollen versus egg cell and seed treatment, and what are the basic events.  This will possibly contribute to a better theory of the effective factors in chemical mutagenesis within cells of higher plants.<p>
