Azur-eosin Giemsa-Romanovsky's stains cytoplasm of mature pollen of
Arabidopsis in red colour (Sokolov and Petrov, 1984). Therefore it is
difficult to reveal and photograph the vegetative nucleus, which is
stained in pale-violet colour and can be seen only in a small number
of pollen grains.<p>

This communication suggests a new method of staining mature pollen
Arabidopsis by means of gallocyano-chrome alum. This method permits to
observe clear figures of all nuclei.<p>

The colour is prepared in the following way: 150 mg of gallocyano and
5g of chromic alum were dissolved in 100 ml of distilled water. The
solution was boiled for 3-5 min. After that it was filtered. The
colour solution prepared must be kept in darkness.<p>

The preparations of mature pollen were made as already described
(Sokolov and Petrov, 1984). These preparations were fixed in Carnoy
mixture (ethanol, chloroform, acetic acid; 6:3:1) for 3 min. After
that it was washed in 2 vessels with 70% ethanol and in 2 vessels with
distilled water. The influence of 50% hydrochloric acid is very
important to succeed. That treatment lasted for 5 min. Thereafter the
preparations have to be washed in 2 vessels of distilled water and
placed in the colour solution for 2 days. After staining the
preparations were rinsed in tap running water for 15 min and
afterwards in distilled water. Then the preparations were washed in to
vessels of 96% ethanol, butanol and xylol. After that they were
flooded in Canadian balsam.<p>

The cytoplasm of mature pollen grains were not stained (Figure 1).
Generative nuclei were stained in dark-violet colour. Vegetative
nuclei were of light-violet colour. Round chromocentres can often be
seen in the generative nuclei. The maximum number of them is equal to
5 for race Enkheim.<p>
