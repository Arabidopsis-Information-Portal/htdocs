<p>
Arabidopsis is a small annual weed which belongs to the
Brassicaceae (mustard or crucifer) family. Several species belong to
the <i>Arabidopsis</i> genus, the most well known member and the one
most extensively used in research is <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> (L.)
Heyhn 2n=10 (common name thale cress or mouse eared cress).

<p>
Arabidopsis occurs naturally throughout temperate regions of the world
including Europe, East Africa, Asia and Japan. It is also found in North
America and Australia, following introduction to these regions. Its
natural habitat is open free draining ground, such as poor sandy or
gravelly soil and can commonly be found growing on wasteland, by carparks
and railway sidings. 

<p>
Although of no inherent economic value, Arabidopsis offers many
advantages for rapid genetic and molecular analysis including its
small size, rapid life cycle, small simple genome, prolific seed
production and the availability of numerous mutations. This weed has
thus become the focus of considerable research internationally to
understand the biology of a flowering plant at the molecular
level. TAIR collects and makes available the information arising from
these efforts.
