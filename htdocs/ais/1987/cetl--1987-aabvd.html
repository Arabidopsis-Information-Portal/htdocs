Our A. thaliana research programme focused on the problems of
ecological genetics of developmental rate started 24 years ago. The
necessity to extend it on the processes taking place in populations
directed us more and more to theoretical and experimental population
genetics of this self-fertilizing plant species and, finally, to its
possibilities to serve as a model object for the plant breeding in the
group of economically important self-fertilizing plants.<p>

1 - Variation in the developmental rate (early flowering,
nonvernalizable summer annual habit vs. late flowering, vernalizable
winter-annual habit) in Moravian natural populations.<p>

CONCLUSIONS<p>

Genoclinal variation: The territory of South Moravia with its height
and termperature SE-NW gradient carries all transitions from
winter-annuals predominantly in the SE warm and dry lowlands to
summer-annuals predominating in the NW highlands.<p>

High within-population and within-line variation in the developmental
rate appears a consequence of high frequency of heterozygotes
segregating and recombining for flowering time genes.<p>

Genetic analyses of lines from Moravian population shows dominant or
partially dominant alleles of the L gene(s) are responsible for the
winter-annual habit. Gene interactions with the L gene(s) (epistasis,
complementary) are frequent. Attempts to detect dominant suppressors
of the L gene(s) like those present in the dominant early flowering,
nonvernalizable Dijon-G line were futile; Moravian summer-annuals
appear recessive.<p>

Genoclinal variation in the developmental rate as related to plant
cover and to anthropic effect yields that correlation exists between
the plant communities arranged according to their relation to
temperature and the developmental rate of populations. Destroying the
soil surface leads to an increase in the frequency of summer annuals.
The natural occurence of A. thaliana appears probable only in the SE
lowland; the synanthropic occurrence in the NW highlands seems to
result from the parallel colonizing activity of man and A. thaliana
(two waves of colonization from the lowlands towards the mountains:
13. and 18. centuries).<p>

Supposed elements of the genetic structure of A. thaliana natural
populations are (1) mating type: Predominant self fertilization, low
proportion of random mating, (2) zygotic selection: A selective
advantage of heterozygotes, (3) balanced polymorphism for
flowering-time genes appears a frequent equilibrium condition at least
in the lowland populations.<p>

2 - Theoretical and experimental study of the genetic structure of A.
thaliana populations.<p>

The aim was to test the above hypothesis about the mating type,
zygotic selection, and possibility of equilibria connected with
balanced polymorphism. The theoretical models for one locus with two
alleles were taken over from Allard and coworkers and developed for
more special or more complex cases. The experimental solution was
based on the use of recessive mutations with visible or lethal effects
(m) induced mainly in the Dijon-G line and serving as markers with
pleiotropic effects on mating and zygotic selection. The marker lines
were expected to differ from Dijon-G only in the marked locus.<p>

Mating type: The rate of random mating was estimated by means of the
frequency of complementing wild type heterozygotes in the progeny of
several pairs of non allelic recessive mutants grown together in mixed
cultures. A possiblity of testing reciprocal differences was ensured.<p>

Zygotic selection: Relative viabilities by means of the survival rates
of plants to maturity (v 1, v 2), relative fertilities by means of the
number of seeds per plant (f 1, F2) and resulting adaptive values (w
1, w 2) of the ++ and mm homozygotes compared with the +m heterozygote
(reference type) were estimated in the progeny of F1 hybrids
segegating for the three genotypes in expected frequencies.<p>

RESULTS<p>

Mating type: Very low rates of random mating were estimated by means
of the frequency of complementing wild type heterozygotes among the
progeny from mixed cultures except for the combinations with the female
ln mutation (Table 1).<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol25/vol25-pg69-tab1.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

Table 1: Frequency of the complementing wild type heterozygotes among
the progeny from mixed cultures of different pairs of nonallelic
recessive mutant lines (pooled data).<p>

The abnormal behaviour of the ln line taken as female seems to depend
on its partial fertility; the insufficiency of its pollen to bring
about normal selfing leads to a certain opportunity of random mating
in the neighbourhood of plants of another genotype (TRNENA et al.,
1986). The proportion of heterozygotes from random mating of about .5,
1 or 2 percent found in similar former experiments (Lawrence and
Snape, 1971; Robbelen, 1971) seems to testify for certain limitations
of self fertilization. The proportion of 1.2x10E-3 random mating in
all other marker lines with normal self fertilization appears fairly
close to that given by Redei (1975) who estimated it not higher than
10E-4.<p>

Thus the mating type of majority of tested genotypes of A. thaliana
appears self-fertilization, and theoretically models for complete
self-fertilization (a=1) are satisfactory. In rather special cases, as
in the ln line, with considerable amounts of random mating (c>O),
other models are necessary (see below).<p>

Zygotic selection: Only less than 20 percent of the loci studied
carrying a dominant wild type allele +/- and a recessive mutant one m
did not show any selective advantage of heterozygotes as expressed by
the adaptive value of the homozygote with the higher adaptive value
equal or higher than 1. In more than 80 percent of loci this value was
lower than 1, and in approximately 25 percent of loci, lower than .5
(Table 2). In all loci, the ++ homozygote showed a higher adaptive
value than the mm homozygote. This is why the ultimate loss of the
recessive m alleles is to be predicted for the loci of the group 1 and
2. Only in group 3, the m allele will be fixed in equilibrium by means
of the mechanism of balanced polymorphism.<p>

The classification of the loci studied is valid for complete
self-fertilization but will not change even if the rate of random
mating with c=.5, 1, 2, or 4 percent will be taken into account. At
the same time, the limit of the adaptive value for balanced
polymorphism will be higher at any c>O. In contrast to complete
self-fertilization (a=1; c=O) where the loss or fixation of the m
allele depends on and only on the adaptive value of the ++ homozygote,
a significant role is played by the symmetry of adaptive values of the
two homozygotes at any proportion of random mating (a<1; c>O). The
limit of the adaptive value appears the higher than .5 the more
similar are the adaptive values of the two homozygotes. In the extreme
case, when the m allele is lethal, the limit adaptive value is
increasing extremely slowly.<p>

Table 2: Classification of 21 loci into three groups according to the
adaptive value of the homozygote with higher adaptive value, w (the
adaptive value of the homozygote=1).<p>

3 - The effect of the whole genome (of the genetic background) on the
adaptive value of the marked genotypes<p>

This problem was studied in connection with the former positive
results obtained by Porubova-Svobodova and Cetl (1978) in A. thaliana
and by Cetl (1983) in D. melanogaster.<p>

The mm marker line were crossed (1) with Dijon-G line in whose genetic
background the mutant alleles were induced (control), (2) with other
highly homozygous wild type lines of another origin. In the latter
case, a partial change of the original genetic background of the
marker lines took place, and not only the alleles of marker loci (+,m)
but also the alleles of all (unknown) loci carrying different alleles
from the Dijon-G line and from the donors of the new genetic
background did segregate and recombine among the progeny.<p>

RESULTS<p>

Considerable shifts in the adaptive values of lthe ++ and lclc
homozygotes arose in either direction when the genetic background of
the lc locus was substituted partially by means of crossing with the
Br, Je 54 and H 55 lines (Relichova and Michalek, 1986, Table 3).<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol25/vol25-pg72-tab3.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

Table 3: Adaptive values of the ++ (w 1) and lclc (w 2) homozygotes
with the original (Dijon-G) and partially changed genetic background
of the Br, H 55 and Je 54 lines as donors of the new genetic
background (the adaptive value of the +lc heterozygote =1).<p>

The effect of the genetic material from the H 55 line appeared
remarkable owing to the fact that the partial replacement of the
original genetic background led to an apparent symmetrization of the
selection response of the two homozygotes. At c = 0, the condition for
transient polymorphism appears the same as in the control (group 2)
but, in contrast to all other cases, the lc allele would be fixed in
equilibrium. For c=.04, an equilibrium connected with balanced
polymorphism would be predicted at the frequencies .13, .10, and .77
for the ++, +lc, and lclc genotypes, respectively.<p>

Similarly to D. malanogaster, gene-modifiers of the adaptive value of
genotypes may be expected to exist in the genomes of the line-donors
of the partially changed genetic background also in A. thaliana. They
may be able to modify the pleitropic effect of marker alleles on the
behaviour of genotypes under zygotic selection. Their sets which
appear optimal in shifting the adaptive values in a desired direction
and extent may easily be detected and obtained in the form of highly
homozygous lines by means of screening and artificial selection in the
laboratory and natural material.<p>

It may be concluded that also zygotic selection with a selective
advantage of heterozygotes was proved experimentally by means of
markers with pleiotropic effects on the adaptive values of genotypes.
And, moreover, this effect may substantially change by means of
appropriate gene modifiers. This year, the solution of two problems is
underway: The heterotic effect of marker alleles in a partially
substituted genetic background (Havlova and Cetl). The construction of
a theoretical model for mixed mating extending the
genotype-independent model with mixed mating (Allard, Jain and
Workman, 1968) with the genotype dependent one without selection
(Trnena) and with zygotic selection (Cetl).<p>

4 - The heterotic effect of marker alleles in the original and
partially substituted genetic background.<p>

The recessive lc and gr marker lines homozygous for the mutant alleles
induced in the highly homozygous genetic background of the Dijon-G
line were crossed as mothers with the highly homozygous wild type
lines Dijon-G (control), H 55, Je 54, Da 6-16, Jm 4-12, and Sn 5 as
fathers, i.e., without reciprocals. The mean performance of the F1
hybrids +lc and +gr in 15 different metric characters measured in well
defined developmental stages (Table 4) was compared with the
numerically higher parental means (percent).<p>

RESULTS<p>

Both maternal lines did not take part on total variation
significantly, while the six paternal lines and also the different
characters did. Also the interaction of the parental lines showed a
statistically significant effect on variation, in contrast to the two
other interactions with the characters (Table 5).<p>

Figure 1: The overall average performance of F1 hybrids (x) and the
average performance of F1 hybrids for the two maternal lines, 6
paternal lines and 15 characters studied (paternal lines with lclc - -
- and with grgr-------).<p>

As demonstrated in Figure 1, the effect of the paternal lines on the
F1 performance could be expressed by means of the sequence<p>

Di < H = Je < Sn = Jm < Da<p>

testifying for a positive but fairly different effect of the genomes
taken from the Moravian natural material. The original genetic
background was unable to bring about "monogenic heterosis" except for
sporadic cases in single characters. The low average F1 performance of
Dijon-G (88%) did not differ from 100 % significantly. On the other
hand, the genetic background of the Da 6-16 line led to the best F1
average performance (162%).<p>

The average F1 performance in particular characters qualified three
statistically different groups of characters: (1) those determining
the developmental rate or correlated with it (characters no. 7, 3, 12
and 1) with an average at about 100%, (2) those expressing the
vegetative vigour (characters no. 11, 13, 9, 5, 4, 2, 8, 10, and 6)
with an average at about 125% (3) those connected with the
reproduction capacity (characters no. 14 and 15), namely, the pod
number with an average at about 150%, and the seed number with a mean
of about 230%. Thus, the hetrotic effect manifested itself rather by
"euheterosis" than by "luxuriance".<p>

The statistically significant effect of the maternal x paternal line's
interaction was obvious, above all, in the Sn 5 genetic background
where the average heterotic effect was 199.8% for the lc allele
(significantly higher than 100%) but only 74.3% for the gr allele
(significantly not different from 100%). The results are intersting
from the point of view of the mechanism of heterosis. They seem to
support rather the hypothesis based on the effect of non allelic
interactions (f.i., epistasis of the complementary type) than the
hypothesis of dominance of favourable genes or of heterozygosity
(superdominance).<p>

Figure 2: Possible new gene interactions arising in the F1 hybrids
between the genes of the maternal mm lines and those of the paternal
wild type lines Dijon-G (above) and other lines (below). A...N are the
(unknown) genes in the paternal genomes. Two alleles with dominance
are considered for simplification.<p>

A possibility of marker lines to enter new interactions with the
(unknown) genes of the donor lines is shown in Figure 2. The other
kind of interactions between genes of Dijon-G and the genes of the
donor lines is not given for simplification. In the Sn 5 line, a gene
or genes seem to occur interacting with the lc allele in an opposite
direction than with the gr allele. Epistasis may be imagined to
operate.<p>

Regarding the discovery of the small size and simple organization of
the A. thaliana genome (Meyerowitz and Pruitt, 1985; Pruitt and
Meyerowitz, 1986) it seems probable that the main role in heterosis is
played more likely by unique sequences representing structural genes
coding for polypeptides than by repetitive sequences or dispersed
repeat families. The aim of our experimental approach using
substitutions in the genetic background of the marker alleles is to
respect the role of the whole genome in selection and also in
heterosis. As yet, the direct study of the F1 performance was omitted,
and only the segregating progeny of heterozygotes was used in
estimating adaptive values. There is some evidence that the +m
heterozygotes appearing in the progeny of the F1 hybrids are worse in
performance than the F1 hybrids themselves, obviously in the
consequence of recombination breaking up favourable associations of
genes, may be, in a form of supergenes.<p>

5 - The theoretical model of populations with genotype dependent mixed
mating.<p>

The genotype independent model for mixed mating (Allard, Jain and
Workman, 1968) appears useful in all cases where the mating type is a
common property of all genotypes of a species. The difficulties
arising in the appreciation of the role of mutant alleles having a
pleitropic effect on mating, like our ln allele, led us to the
construction of another model for genotype dependent mixed mating.
Only the female contribution of genoytpes to mating was considered
(Table 6).<p>

The starting point was the equation (1) for the approximate
equilibrium coefficient of inbreeding without selection used in our
paper with Tagetes patula L. (Cetl and Relichova, 1980). Later, the
equation (2) was derived rendering possible to express the average
self fertilization rate a, when the proportions of selfing of the two
homozygotes, *alpha* and *gamma*, are known. The equations (1) and (2)
may be used in calculating the approximate genotypic frequencies in
eqilibrium populations. The approximate genotypic frequencies are
evidently not dependent on the self fertilization rate of the
heterozygote.<p>

Recently, Trnena succeeded in deriving the equations for exact
equilibrium genotypic frequencies if the *beta* values, of course, are
known. The relation between *beta* on the one hand and *alpha*,
*gamma* on the other expresses the degree of dominance of the
corresponding allele, say A 2. At *alpha* = *beta* not = *gamma*, the
A 2 allele is recessive in its pleiotropic effect on mating. When
*beta* = (*alpha*+*beta*)/2 there is no dominance. At *alpha* not =
*beta* = *gamma* the A 2 allele is completely dominant in its
pleiotropic effect on mating. The equation (3) expressing the exact
equilibrium frequency of heterozygote H, may be used to correct the
equilibrium frequencies estimated by means of the approximate
equations (1) and (2).<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol25/vol25-pg79-tab6.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

Table 6: Elements of the theoretical model for genotype dependent
mixed mating populations.<p>

Trnena also demonstrated the equilibrium frequency of the heterozygote
for *alpha*=*beta*=1, and for different *gamma* decreasing from 1 to 0
when different gene frequencies of the A 1 allele, p were considered.
In Figure 3, as expected, the case with *gamma*=) led to the highest
heterozygote frequencies, not very different from those with random
mating. Note the slight asymmetry of the curve. In this interesting
case, the A 2 A 2 homozygote is working as an automatic generator of
heterozygotes owing to its inability to bring about self-fertilization
at all. At lower p, higher frequencies of A 2 A 2 homozygote
generating heterozygotes are arising.<p>

At the end, the model was extended for zygotic selection. In the
genotype-independent model, the equations (4) and (5) must be
satisfied in equilibrium in the case that the genotypic frequencies
are scored just after mating, i.e., among newly formed zygotes
(Allard, Jain and Workman, 1968). The only difficulty is the
following: While the gene frequencies do not change during the
progression to equilibrium in the models without selection, they do in
the model with zygotic selection.<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol25/vol25-pg80-fig3.gif">Click here for figure</a><p>

Figure 3: Equilibrium frequency of heterozygotes (H) at different gene
frequencies (p), different proportions of self-fertilization, and
random mating: a - *alpha* = *beta* = *gamma*= 1; (pure self
fertilization), b to f - *alpha* = *beta* = l; *gamma* = .8, .6, .4,
.2, and O, resp., g - *alpha* = *beta* - *gamma* = O (pure random
mating).<p>

When the mating indexes *alpha*, *beta*, and *gamma*, and the adaptive
values of the homozygotes, w 1 and w 2, are known, it is possible by
means of solution of the equations (2), (4), and (5) to obtain the
approximate estimates of the two unknown parameters of the equilibrium
fixation index expressing the joint effect of mating and zygotic
selection, F, of the equilibrium frequency of A 1 allele, p, and,
finally, as shown above, of the exact frequency of the heterozygote,
H.<p>

In Figure 4, only one example is selected from the extensive data
obtained recently, that for *alpha* = *beta* = 1 and *gamma* =O, as
demonstrated above (Figure 3) in connection with the model without
selection. For comparison, the case of complete selfing (a=1, left)
and of genotype-independent mixed mating at equal rates of selfing and
of random mating (a=.5, right) are given. The three situations are
different in various respects. When *alpha* =*beta*=1; *gamma*=O there
is the broadest span of adaptive values of homozygotes enabling to
obtain heterozygotes in equilibrium (H>O). When a=l, the occurrence of
heterozygotes is limited to the adaptive values of homozygotes lower
than .5 imposing a considerable genetic load on the population. In the
two other situations, more auspicious adaptive values of homozygotes
higher than .5 are still ensuring the equilibria H>). At a=.5, two
areas with H=O are occurring while only one in the genotype dependent
mixed mating *alpha* = *beta* = 1; *gamma*=O (when the adaptive values
of the A 2 A 2 homozygote generating heterozygotes are low). In the
latter case, a slight asymmetry appears again.<p>

The most convincing comparison of the three situations is possible by
means of the Wrightian "adaptive landscapes". The average "height
above sea level" expressing the average frequency of heterozygotes in
an equilibrium population is only 8% in the case of complete selfing
but 26% with that of the genotype-dependent mixed mating, and 20% in
that of equal rates of selfing and random mating.<p>

GENERAL CONCLUSION<p>

"Arabidopsis is not an economic plant. It is used only as a tool to
study basic biological problems". This quotation from Redei and Li
(1968) can be applied to the results obtained in A. thaliana
populations. I believe that our attention to the equilibrium
frequencies of the heterozygote under various conditions of mating and
zygotic selection might be interesting for the plant breeders and seed
producers of self fertilizing economic plants as wheat, barley, oats
and others. A "pure" line has still been the lost common form of
cultivars in these plants. Owing to this low production "plasticity",
Borlaug proposed to produce phenotypically uniform but genotypically
diversified complexes of several "pure" lines. This proposal was
successfuly materialized, by Frey in oats and, among others, also by
Czechoslovak barley and wheat breeders. Our experience obtained in A.
thaliana suggests still additional form of complex cultivars of self
fertilizing plants, namely, the equilibrium complexes of genoytpes.
The equilibrium condition represents a limit which can theoretically
never be attained in large populations. Once properly constituted in
corresponding equilibrium frequencies, however, the complex of
genotypes should be stable, paractically, for many generations at
least. These complexes cannot, of course, compete with the best B 1
hybrid cultivars. Unfortunately, the introduction of the classical F1
cultivars based on extrachromosomal male sterility, and chromosomal
restorers of fertility is complicated in self fertilizing plants owing
to the lack of appropriate restorers.<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol25/vol25-pg82-fig4.gif">Click here for figure</a><p>

Figure 4: Equilibrium frequency of heterozygotes (H) at different
adaptive values of homozygotes (w 1, w 2) and different proportions of
self-fertilization and random mating: a - a = 1 (pure
self-fertilization), b - *alpha* = *beta* = 1; *gamma* = O, c - a =
.5.<p>

It may be proved that, f.i., an equilibrium population containing 40%
of heterozygotes whose performance is 125% compared with the
homozygotes will yield 110% compared with the complex of corresponding
"pure" lines. Such an increase in yield is usually held for fairly
high even in the classical breeding for heterosis. An apparent
difficulty in the application of the idea of equilibrium complexes is
the limitation of the system on one locus with two alleles. As
mentioned above, the manipulation with the genetic background of these
alleles, however, uncover various possibilities to enforce the
participation of the who genome in zygotic selection. Also the
mutations leading to shifts from normal self fertilization and working
as automatic generators of heterozygotes may be useful in this
respect.<p>
