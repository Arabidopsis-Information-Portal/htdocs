SUMMARY<p>

When seedlings are rotated perpendicular to the horizontal axis of the
clinostat, wild type of Arabidopsis thaliana exhibits typical
'rotation curvatures' of roots that are always opposite to the
direction of rotation. In contrast, the rotation curvatures are not
produced in aux-1 roots. This reflects an ineffectiveness of the
gravitropic influence of the clinostat on aux-1 roots.<p>

INTRODUCTION<p>

Clinostats have frequently been used in plant physiology to
"compensate" for the unilateral influence of gravity. Rotation of a
plant organ on a horizontal clinostat, however, is not stimulus free.
Larsen (1953) described earlier work on 'rotation curvatures' that
developed opposite to the direction of rotation when roots were
rotated at high angles to the horizontal axis of the clinostat.
Prolonged rotation of plants on horizontal clinostat has also resulted
in modifications of various morphological characteristics (Brown et
al., 1976), ultrastructural alterations in root statocytes (Hensel and
Sievers, 1980) and increased production of ethylene (Hensel and
Iversen, 1980).<p>

Present study describes the root growth of wild type and aux-1
seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana on a horizontal clinostat.<p>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<p>

The mutant aux-1 was induced and isolated in Arabidopsis thaliana
(L.), ecotype Landsberg, erecta mutant as described by Maher and
Martindale (1980). The mutant has previously been described as having
agravitropic roots (Mirza et al., 1984) that do respond to unilateral
light and are negatively phototropic (Mirza, 1987). The parent plant
itself is denoted as "wild type" (WT).<p>

A slightly modified clinostat was used in this study that consisted of
a classical show speed (4 rph) horizontal clinostat and an attachment
wheel. The clinostat and the attachment wheel rotated at the same
speed but in opposite directions. Both wild type and aux-1 seeds were
sown sandwiched between two thin layers of agar (1 percent by w/v) in
each of the polystyrene Petri dishes. After cold treatment
(4*degrees*C for 2 days) in the dark, one dish was mounted (with agar
plant perpendicular to the horizontal clinostat) on each of the
clinosat wheels. The dishes were then rotated at 25 +/- 1*degree*C
either in darkness or with illumination from fluorescent tubes both
from above and below the dishes. After 72 hours incubation, the dishes
were directly exposed on to photographic paper and root curvature
angles were measured from the enlarged photographs following the
scheme given by Mirza (1987).<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

Wild type and aux-1 seedling roots, germinated and grown on the
clinostats during 72 hours incubation, developed in the plane of agar
and exhibited a marked difference in the direction of their growth
(Figure 1a-b, Table 1).<p>

Table 1: Mean curvatures of WT and aux-1 roots developed on the
clinostat in light and darkness. Seedlings were grown as given in
Figure 1. Clockwise curvatures are assigned as (+) and
counterclockwise curvatures as (-). Each value represents 35
seedlings.<p>

Figure 1: Rotation curvatures of Arabidopsis roots developed on the
clinostat in light. Seedlings were germinated and grown sandwiched
between two layers of agar after 72 hours rotation perpendicular to
the horizontal axes of clinostats. (A) clockwise rotation; (B)
counterclockwise rotation.<p>

In light, wild type roots developed prominant counterclockwise
curvatures on clockwise rotating dishes but developed prominant
clockwise curvatures on counterclockwise rotating dishes. In the dark,
wild type roots developed same direction curvatures as in the light.
However the curvatures were less prominant in the dark compared to
those in the light. On the other hand, aux-1 roots grew straighter or
with small random curvatures when rotated clockwise or
counterclockwise in both light and darkness.<p>

It can be seen that wild type roots develop characteristics 'rotation
curvatures' when rotated perpendicular to the horizontal axis of the
clinostat. Such curvatures have earlier been attributed to the
"subsequent inversion effect", i.e., the gravitropic effect of a
stimulus which is followed by inversion of the root is greater than
that produced by any other stimulus received during a complete
revolution (see Larsen, 1953). These curvatures, however, can simply
be explained by considering the direction of gravity vector with
respect to the revolving seedlings. Gravity can be said to revolve
around the seedlings in a direction opposite to the clinostat
rotation. Roots thus develop curvatures in the direction of gravity
revolution. On the same basis, one would expect stems to develop
curvatures in the direction of clinostat rotation. This type of
curvature has been reported in case of Xanthium stems by Hoshizaki and
Hammer (1962).<p>

Higher curvatures developed by wild type roots in light compared to
those developed in darkness could either be due to the heightened
geosensitivity of roots in light (MacDonald and Gordon, 1978, 1979)
or, due to the reduced growth of roots in the dark (Mirza and Maher,
1981).<p>

The gravitropic stimulus of the clinostat, in contrast to wild type,
does not produce any directional response of aux-1 roots. This could
have been expected from the agravitropic nature of aux-1 roots.<p>
