It is found in general that application of gibberellins stimulates
germination of seeds (Jones and Stoddart, 1977). Normal seed
germination probably requires in most cases de novo synthesis of
gibberellins. Therefore, nongerminating GA sensitive mutants as found
at three loci in Arabidopsis (Koornneef et al., 1977; Koornneef,
1978), probably do not germinate because of the absence of
GA-synthesis. It is generally accepted that both promotors like
gibberellins and cytokinines and inhibitors like abscisic acid play a
role in dormancy and germination of seeds. The balance between
promotors and inhibitor may determine the taste of dormancy of a seed.<p>

This concept led us to the idea that the germination capacity of
nongerminating GA-sensitive mutants might be restored when the level
of inhibitors would be reduced by mutating the genes responsible for
their production. Selection of this type of mutants is of course easy
since they are "self-detecting" as germinating seeds in the petri
dishes. During selection of these "revertants", also intragenic
revertants and external suppressor mutations of another type than
suggested above, may occur. In previous studies with Arabidopsis the
isolation of revertants has been applied for thiamine deficient
mutants (Van den &#158;erg et al. 1967), nitrate-reductaseless mutants
(Braaksma and Feenstra, 1979), chlorophyll mutants (Somerville and
Ogren, 1980).<p>

In our experiments seeds of two mutants lines (viz.L659 and NG5; both
at locus ga-1) were treated with 10 mM EMS (24*degrees*C, 24 h). No
clear revertant plants or sectors appeared in the M1 generation. In a
number of M2 lines revertants could be isolated. These were retested
for germination behaviour in the M3 generation. Among 581 M2 lines of
NG5 and 246 M2 lines of L659, respectively, 8 and 1 lines segregated
mutants, which in spite of a high germination capacity of the seed
nevertheless showed the typical dwarf phenotype of GA-sensitive
mutants at the ga-1, ga-2 and ga-3 loci, except for a somewhat weaker
appearance and a slight yellow-brown tinge of the leaves. Genetic
analysis revealed that the increased germination capacity of these
revertants was recesive to the inhibited germination of the parental
ga-1 mutant lines. In the F2 population of crosses between the
revertant lines and the wild type, segregation occurred conform a
9:3:3:1 ratio of wild types, nongerminating GA-sensitive mutants,
germinators which differed slightly from the wild types and
germinating dwarfs (the revertant phenotype). It could be shown that
the new segregant represented the suppressor genotype. All 9
revertants were found to be allelic on the basis of
noncomplimentation. Lines homozygous for the suppressor mutant but
without the recessive ga-1 allel, couuld be isolated as F3 lines from
the above F2's. The recessive suppressor type differed from the wild
type mainly in two aspects:<p>

 1. Seed dormancy seemed to be almost completely absent because high
germination percentages were obtained without after ripening, cold
treatment or light.<p>

2. Siliquae and sometimes complete shoots were withered (Figure 1).
The severeness of the latter symptoms, which are probably caused by an
insufficient water supply of these organs, varied between the
different mutants (alleles). The symptoms appeared most extreme in
winter time when the air-humidity in our greenhouses was relatively
low. Transpiration of the suppressor plants was found to be twice as
high as that of the wild type plants.<p>

In tomato a comparable type of mutant, which wilts very rapidly upon
the application of water stress has been described as the flacca
mutant (TAL and NEVO, 1973). This mutant contained a reduced amount of
the hormone abscisic acid (ABA). Moreover, the wilting effect could be
reversed by spraying with ABA<p>

Aba was shown to be an effective inhibitor of seed germination in
Arabidopsis (Sankhla and Sankhla, 1968) and many other species.
Therefore, in the present study, the hypothesis was tested that the
suppressor gene regulates the amount of ABA in the plant.<p>

The ABA content of dry seeds and unripe siliquae was detrmined by gas
liquid-chromatography with electron capture detection after
methylation of the compound with diazomethane. In two mutant lines,
which showed severe symptoms of withering no ABA was detectable in dry
seeds. In another mutant line with less extreme symptoms, the amount
of ABA in dry seeds and in unripe siliquae was stongly reduced
compared to the wild type. This mutant contained 8 ngr ABA per gr dry
seed and wild type 71 ngr. This line represents a so-called "leaky'
mutant.<p>

Thus it was shown that ABA deficient mutants can be isolated by
selecting for revertants of nongerminating GA-sensitive mutants. The
gene symbol aba is proposed for this locus.<p>

In addition to the revertants described in this report several other
types of revertants were isolated, probably including a real
intragenic revertant.<p>

More details of the results presented here will be described
elsewhere.<p>
