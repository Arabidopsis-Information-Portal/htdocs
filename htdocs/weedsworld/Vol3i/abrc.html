        The ABRC is pleased to announce that Dr. Mark Estelle and Dr. David
Meinke have been added to the Advisory Committee of the Center.  They replaced
Dr. Fred Ausubel and Dr. Elliot Meyerowitz on Jan. 1, 1996.   New Advisory
Committee appointments will be for three-year terms, and one or two members
will be changed each year.  It is felt that this creates maximum community
involvement in the Center's operation. We are greatly indebted to Dr. Ausubel
and Dr. Meyerowitz for their excellent service to the Center as Advisory
Committee members from the beginning of our
operations.  We are likewise grateful that Dr. Estelle and Dr. Meinke have
agreed to serve.<BR>

Work on the 1996 ABRC Seed and DNA Stock List is currently in progress.
 The new volume will be in the form of a supplement to the 1995 version.
 It is felt that the new mutant and clone additions can be summarized in
a separate volume, and the 1995 edition will be relevant forthe remainder
of stocks.  Nevertheless, there are many new seed stocks,clones and libraries
being added to the collection.  A complete electronic version of the catalog
will be placed on the AIMS Web server
(<A HREF="http://aims.cps.msu.edu/aims/">http://aims.cps.msu.edu/aims/</A>) for anyone wishing to print or consultcopies
of integrated catalog chapters.<BR>
<BR>
 Most of the new stocks that will be made available have been listed in
the last issue of Weeds World.  The stock centers are always pleased to
receive new stocks.  The ABRC is especially interested in receiving new
mutants, ecotypes, clones and libraries as well as T-DNA transformed lines
and transposon-transposed lines.   A number of new ventures are planned
in the future by ABRC.  These include potential acquisitions of isolated
DNA from large-insert libraries and T-DNA lines for use in PCR-based exploration.
 When important new stocks are made available, notice will be given on the
electronic newsgroup and Weeds World.<BR>

The AIMS database has recently been transferred to a new server, which is
much faster than the original computer and should be capable of handling
the increasing usage.  The previous server (a Sparc II) had been overloaded
for some time with the current data and user demand.  It is hoped that the new server will be able to cope with the necessary tasks
for some time to come.  You may have noticed that the  home page of the
AIMS Web server has been moved (new address, <A HREF="http://aims.cps.msu.edu/aims/">http://aims.cps.msu.edu/aims/</A>):
This was instituted in connection with the server transfer.  The database
can still be located from the original home page.  However, please add the
new location to your bookmarks, as the &quot;genesys&quot; address will
eventually be phased out completely.<BR>
<BR>
Several  new features have been added to AIMS.  One of these, the on-line
catalog, is potentially very useful.  The sections of this catalog are each
organized into single Web pages.  This allows searching of each section
using the search function of the users' Web browsers, as well as
selective or complete printing of the catalog.  Two other important items
have been added to the AIMS Web: 1) The EST anchoring data of the Bertrand
Lemieux laboratory,  both as a text page and incorporated into the stock
descriptions of AIMS, and 2) a Refer-export file from EndNote of
Arabidopsis references published since the beginning of 1995.  This file
can be ftped and loaded directly into EndNote on your computer.  AIMS is
also currently up-to-date for all ESTs, and direct linkages to the sequence
databases exist for these clones.<BR>
