*  I realize that many labs have tried the in planta transformation protocols
developed in my lab, but only a few have succeeded.  (This technique has not yet
been successful in the Dean lab.)  The protocol certainly works, but one has to
know what one is doing and has to try many plants at least until you get the
feeling.  The following is the protocol I distributed at the Arabidopsis
training workshop in Japan (Nov.26,1991), which was organized by Dr. Okada at
NIBB, Okazaki. 

1.  BACKGROUND
 *  Agrobacterium genetically colonises wounded plant cells by transferring a
defined segment  (T- DNA) of its Ti plasmid into the plant nuclear genome. 
Although this natural gene-transfer mechanism has been widely adopted in plant
transformation, the possibility of generating transformed progeny by
Agrobacterium infection in planta has not been successfuly  exploited. Here we
show stably transformed progenies of a crucifer plant, Arabidopsis, are 
efficiently obtained by simple incision of primary shoots at their bases and by
subsequent  Agrobacterium inoculation at the wound site.  Adventitous shoots
arising from the infected  wound site were transformed at a high frequency and
produced transformed progenies later. 

2.  SEED GERMINATION AND PLANT GROWTH
  (i) Soak seeds on the filters wetted in 10mM KNO3, 10mM NaPO4, pH 7.0 and
place at 4oC. in the dark for 48 h. 
 *  Seeds may be directly sown on soil without imbibition and/or cold treatment,
but the germination will not be uniform. 

  (ii) Sow cold-treated seeds on compounded soil (e.g., Metromix 200) or
vermiculite soaked with Hogland's solution and cover the pots with saran wrap. 
  (iii) Transfer germinated seedlings to a controlled growth chamber (16h
light/8h dark). 
  (iv) For healthy growth, water and fertilse sufficiently and protect from
fungal or insects attack. 
 *  For efficient transformation, plant materials must be healthy.
 *  Fertilise usung Hogland's solution or a commercial mixture (e.g., Hyponex).

3.  WOUNDING AND AGROBACTERIA INFECTION
  (i) When the primary inflorescences have grown to 2-3 cm in  height, remove
them by severing the basal part with a scalpel or scissors and remove auxillary
buds as completely as possible with fine forceps.  This step is most critical. 
You want to remove as many preformed shoot meristems as possible, and to make
the reorganization of shoot meristems from infected and transformed cells. 
 *  The timing of infection is important.

  (ii) Sometimes it helps to make deep wound into the remaining stem with a
needle or toothpick. 
  (iii) Inoculate wounds with Agrobacteria from overnight culture grown in YEP
media.  *  Overnight culture Agrobacteria are concentrated to 1/5 volume by
centrifugation at 600 rpm  for 5 min, followed by  resuspension in the remaining
medium. 

  (iv) Place inoculated plants in the shade or low light intensity  for 2-3 d at
28oC. 
  (v) Transfer  plants (pots) to standard  growth conditions, until secondary
inflorescences emerge (about 10-14 d) 
  (vi) One or more inflorescences should develop from the wound site.  Remove
the early emerging inflorescences and reinoculate Agrobacteria onto the wound
sites by repeating the procedure described above. 
  (vii) The efficiency of transformation may be tested by an assay of leaves on
the newly formed shoots. 
 *  We used pBI121,a binary vector containing the NPT II and GUS genes within
the T-DNA region. 

  (viii) The later emerging inflorescences are maintained through maturity for
seed generation.
