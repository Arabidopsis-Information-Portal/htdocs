PhD Studentship, Prof. Jim Murray, Cardiff University 
4 year PhD Studentship funded by Bayer CropScience, available to all UK and EU residents 
Manipulation of seed development using cell cycle genes in Arabidopsis and Brassica 
 
A prestigious PhD studentship is available working with Prof. Jim Murray and Dr Walter Dewitte, 
recently moved to new state-of-the art facilities in the School of Biosciences, Cardiff University, 
where the lab is currently recruiting. The project is fully funded by Bayer CropScience 
(http://www.bayercropscience.com/) for 4 years from October 2009 or earlier, with an annual 
enhanced stipend of £15790 (rising to £17450 by Year 4). The studentship and stipend is open to 
all UK and EU nationals with full funding of both fees and maintenance stipend. The project builds 
on existing collaborations between Bayer CropScience and the Murray lab, and aims to use cell 
cycle genes to control seed size and development in Arabidopsis and Brassica. The project will 
be based in Cardiff but also involve time in Gent, Belgium working with Bayer CropScience. 
For more information on the Murray lab, see http://www.murraylab.org.uk and on the exciting 
capital city of Wales and beautiful landscapes see http://www.VisitCardiff.com/About-
Cardiff.html and http://www.visitsouthwales.com/ . A equivalent to a upper second class or 
Masters degree in Plant Biology, Biochemistry/ Molecular Biology or related subjects is required, 
and previous practical experience in plant biology would be highly desirable. To apply, please 
send both a hardcopy and email of a full CV, a description of past lab experience and projects 
undertaken and full contacts (including emails) of two referees to Prof Jim Murray. Closing date: 
May 17th 2009, but early application is encouraged.
