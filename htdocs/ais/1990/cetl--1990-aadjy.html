ABSTRACT<p>

An extended theoretical model of the equilibrium populations of
completely self-fertilizing species under various effects of natural
selection against zygotes is constructed and applied to the
genecological relations in natural populations of A. thaliana. Even
relatively moderate selection pressures against homozygotes may
warrant equilibria connected with balanced polymorphism at low genetic
load in the NW part of the Moravian genocline. Also other kinds of
genetic polymorphism are shown to occur in the large span of selection
pressures considered.<p>

INTRODUCTION<p>

Large differences in flowering time were found in laboratory
experiments with natural populations of A. thaliana from Moravia.
Variation on three levels was observed: Between populations and within
populations both between plants and within plants, i.e., within
families. The differences were proved to be clinal and
gene-controlled.<p>

The following elements of the genetic structure of these populations
were deduced: (1) Mating with predominant self-fertilization and low
proportion of random-mating.  (2) Frequent natural, zygotic selection
with a selective advantage of heterozygotes for flowering-time genes.
(3) A possibility of equilibria connected with balanced polymorphism
for flowering-time genes (CETL, 1976a, 1978, 1987).  The latter
phenomenon was examined by means of a joint theoretical and
experimental approach for the SE part of the genocline. The
populations of this lowland territory are characterized by a
prevalence of late flowering genotypes and strong selective pressures
against the early flowering ones. A theoretical model was offered for
this part of the Moravian populations (CETL, 1976a,b,c).<p>

An extension of this model on the whole territory where the frequency
of early flowering genotypes is gradually increasing and the selection
pressures against them are gradually relaxed towards the NW highlands
will be reported here. Special attention will be given to the general
approach in constructing theoretical models of populations of
self-fertilizing species and to the consequences of these models for
polymorphism and genecological relations.<p>

MATERIAL AND METHOD<p>

The numerical material came from our longtermed experiments carried
out under highly standardized growing conditions (25*degrees*C,
continuous illumination 1250 lx). This artificial environment was
analyzing from the point of view of flowering-time differences brought
about by differences in the vernalization requirement.  The basic data
used here were the proportions of generative plants during 28 days
after emergence, g 28, for each of the 258 population samples studied.
The 28 days' data were chosen as on the time-scale of our experiments
the 28th days is decisive for separating the two groups of genotypes:
i) The early flowering, nonwintering, summer-annual genotypes
requiring no or short vernalization from the late flowering or
remaining in vegetative state, ii) wintering, winter-annual genotypes
requiring long vernalization as shown by means of a comparison with
the results obtained in natural conditions, at least in those of Brno
(EFFMERTOVA, 1967; CETL, 1978). Further, the estimates of the
frequency of heterozygotes for flowering-time genes (DOBROVOLNA,
1967; PERINOVA and CETL, 1983) were used.<p>

The main preconditions of the initial theoretical model were accepted
here also.<p>

(1) Complete self-fertilization was considered.<p>

(2) The flowering-time differences were ascribed to a pair of alleles
of a gene with a completely dominant allele for late flowering, L, and
a recessive allele for early flowering, l. This highly simplified
scheme was in agreement not only with the first genetic analyses of
the flowering-time differences (HARER, 1951) but also with the
results of our experiments (KARLOVSKA, 1974; OTRUBOVA and CETL,
1985) and, at least partially, with the results of NAPP-ZINN (1979).
Really, several genes with two or more alleles each seem to be
responsible for flowering-time differences. With two or more genes, of
course, the situation might be complicated by gene interaction and
linkage. The simplified approach based on independent genes whose
completely dominant alleles (L 1, L 2, L 3,...) are responsible for
any retardation in the onset of flowering as compared with the
recessive ones (l 1, l 2, l 3,...)  gives, however, a possibility to
take into account all differences between genotypes on the timescale
of flowering and to consider them summarily.<p>

(3) The Ll heterozygote was chosen reference genotype with adaptive
value equal 1.<p>

The initial theoretical model operated with complete natural selection
against the early flowering ll homozygote. So the adaptive values of
the three genotypes (LL, Ll, ll) were (w 1, 1, 0). A simple
theoretical model (ii) "asymmetry with lethality" (CETL, 1976b) was
satisfactory. Its validity was shown to be limited to low frequencies
of the ll homozygote in the nonselective environment up to (Q) = 0.2.<p>

A more complicated theoretical model (iii) "asymmetry without
lethality" (CETL, 1976b) had to be used with the adaptive values of
the three genotypes (w 1, 1, w 2>0). Unfortunately, the model was not
explicitly specified in CETL (1976b) and there is also an appreciable
lack of convenient solution in literature after HAYMAN and MATHER
(1953, 1956) and ALLARD, JAIN and WORKMAN (1968). The model must be
valid in the whole interval of the frequencies of the ll homozygote
from 0 to 1.<p>

The symbols were used as follows:<p>

<pre>
Genotypes                 LL      Ll      ll
Genotypic frequencies     P       H       Q
Adaptive values           w 1     1       w 2
</pre><p>

The construction of the complete theoretical model started with the
determination of changes of the genotypic frequencies during one
generation of natural selection:<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol27/vol27-pg29-fig1.gif">Click here for figure</a><p>

P, H, and Q are the genotypic frequencies in the original population
and P', H', and Q' those after one generation of zygotic selection.
Notice that the denominator equals .5.<p>

The equations (1) were used in computer simulations of genotypic
frequencies changing during successive generations on the way to
equilibrium in a broad span of w 1 and w 2 and under certain initial
genotypic frequencies.  In equilibrium<p>

P' = P = P e, H' = H = H e, and Q' = Q = Q e<p>

where P e, H e, and Q e are the equilibrium genotypic frequencies.<p>

Solving the equations (1) according to this statement and using P e +
H e + Q e = 1 we obtained<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol27/vol27-pg30-fig1.gif">Click here for figure</a><p>

The equations (2) were used in computer simulations of equilibrium
genotypic frequencies for the adaptive values w 1, w 2 increasing from
0 to 2, i.e., from those with the maximum selection advantage of the
heterozygote to those with selection neutrality (w 1 = w 2 = 1) and,
finally, to those with a selection disadvantage of the heterozygote.
Using<p>

p e = P e + 0.5H e and q e = Q e + 0.5H e (3)<p>

the equilibrium gene frequencies p e and q e were computed along with
the equilibrium fixation index, F e, expressing the joint effect of
inbreeding and selection:<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol27/vol27-pg30-fig2.gif">Click here for figure</a><p>

At the end, we attempted to appreciate also the segregation genetic
load arising from the selection against the two homozygotes in an
equilibrium population when w1 < 1 and w 2 < 1. Instead of the formula
L 1 = 2st/(s + t) (MORTON, CROW and MULLER, 1956) for the segregation
load in an inbred population where s = 1 - w 1 and t = 1 - w 2, we
attempted to prove that the equilibrium segregation load, L e, equals
simply 0.5H e.<p>

Without any segregation load, without any loss of zygotes in the
consequence of selection against homozygotes during one generation,
the equilibrium genotypic frequencies of homozygotes would be P'e(0) =
p e + 0.25H e and Q'e(0) = Q e + 0.25He instead of P'e = Pe and Q'e =
Q e as they really are with the zygotic selection considered. The sum
of the differences between P'e(0) and Q'e(0) on one hand and P'e and
Q'e on the other represents the proportion of zygotes lost by means of
selection during one generation and equals 0.25H e + 0.25H e. Thus,<p>

L e = 0.5H e<p>

The equilibrium segregation load, L e, equals a half of the
equilibrium frequency of the heterozygote under zygotic selection
against homozygotes.<p>

RESULTS<p>

The equations (1) for four different sets of w 1 and w 2 at H 0 = 1
(the populations were imagined to be founded by a large group of Ll
heterozygotes) were used to construct the triads of curves
demonstrating the changes of frequency of the three genotypes during
the first 15 generation of natural selection (Figure 1). In a (w 1 =
0.2; w 2 = 0.15) and in b (w 1 = 0.4; w 2 = 0.3), the curves tend
clearly to equilibria in which all three genotypes remain in the
population.  At very low adaptive values (a), equilibrium is attained
during several generations while at higher adaptive values (b),
equilibrium would be attained later than in the 15th generation. On
the contrary, in c (w 1 = 0.8; w 2 = 0.6) and in d (w 1 = 1.6; w 2 =
1.2), equilibria are obviously connected with the fixation of the LL
genotype and with the loss of the Ll heterozygote and later also with
the loss of the ll genotype. The difference between c and d is only in
the rate of the process of fixation and loss. Let us notice that under
w 1 and w 2 replaced mutually, also the frequencies of LL, P, for
those of ll, Q, must be replaced while the frequencies of Ll, H, will
remain the same.<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol27/vol27-pg32-fig1.gif">Click here for figure</a><p>

Figure 1. Changes of genotypic frequencies of LL, Ll, and ll (P, H and
Q) during the first 15 generations when H 0 = 1.  a: w1 = 0.2, w2 =
0.15; b: w1 = 0.4, w2 = 0.3; c: w1 = 0.8, w2 = 0.6; d: w1 = 1.6, w2 =
1.2.<p>

When the equilibrium genotypic frequencies were computed by means of
the equations (2) for different w 1 and w 2 increasing from 0 to 2
nontrivial equilibria were found only for 0 <= w 1 < 0.5 and 0 <=
w 2 < 0.5. Indeterminate solutions were obtained at w1 = 0.5 and w 2 =
0.5 owing to the fact that the denominators in (2) equal to 0. No
solutions within the interval from 0 to 1 for equilibrium genotypic
frequencies were found at 0.5 < w 1 < 1 and 0.5 < w 2 < 1 and also at
all w 1 > 1 and w 2 > 1. Thus, the equations (2) don't have
satisfactory solution when w 1 >= 0.5 and w 2 >= 0.5.<p>

Regardless of these difficulties, the progression of populations to
equilibria may be demonstrated by means of the equations (1) also in
these troublesome cases. When w 1 >= 0.5 and w 2 >= 0.5 two
possibilities are to be recognized:<p>

(1) with w 1 = w 2 ("symmetrical" selection), the equilibrium is at P
e = Q e = 0.5.<p>

(2) with w 1 &#130; w 2 ("asymmetrical" selection), the equilibrium is
either at P e = 1 when w 1 > w 2 or at Q e = 1 when w 1 < w 2.  The
heterozygote is lost in equilibrium in each case.<p>

Some causes of the unsatisfactory solution of equations (2) at w 1 >
0.5 and w 2 > 0.5 are obvious from Figure 1 c, d. With "symmetrical"
selection (not shown in Figure 1), only the heterozygote tends to be
lost in the population. With "asymmetrical" selection, not only the
heterozygote but also the homozygote with lower adaptive value tend to
be lost, and only that with higher adaptive value remains in the
equilibrium population.  Thus the difficulties arising at w 1 > 0.5
and w 2 > 0.5 are connected with the loss of one or two of the three
genotypes so that the accepted system with stable adaptive values is
invalidated. The system is valid only with H > 0. The heterozygote
represents a reference genotype and the adaptive values of homozygotes
are expressed relatively to it.<p>

The equilibrium frequencies of the heterozygote, H e, within the
interval 0 <= w 1 < 0.5 and 0 <= w 2 < 0.5 are given in Figure 2.
This form of presentation is analogical to that of the initial model
with w 2 = 0, i.e., H e is shown as dependent on the equilibrium
frequencies of the ll homozygote, Q e (cf. CETL, 1976a, Figure 10).
The w 1 and w 2 values were chosen equal 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.45,
0.49, and 0.5. The whole range of Q e from 0 to 1 is covered in
contrast to the initial model. The H e values from the initial model
are presented in Figure 2 by the intersections of particular straight
lines for different w 1's with the y axis.  All other relations
following from Figure 2 are new. The dependence of H e on Q e appears
indirect and, as expected, the higher w 2 and the lower w 1 the more
ll homozygotes will be preserved in the equilibrium population. High
equilibrium frequencies of ll coming close to 1 are only possible with
the w 2 values coming near to 0.5 regardless of the w 1 values.<p>

It is to recall that Figure 2 may be used easily in appreciating the
segregation genetic load in equilibrium, L e, under various w's. As
mentioned above, L e = 0.5H e. Thus the same dependence of L e on Q e
at different w's may be observed but the values on the y axis are to
be halved.<p>

Figure 2. Equilibrium frequencies of the Ll heterozygote, H e, and
equilibrium segregation load, L e, as dependent on equilibrium
frequencies of the ll homozygote, Q e, at different adaptive values of
homozygotes, w1 and w2.<p>

Similarly to Figure 2, the equilibrium fixation index, Fe, within the
same interval of w's is given in Figure 3 as dependent on the
equilibrium frequency of the ll homozygote, Q e. The Fe values are
between -1 to +1 within the range of Q e from 0 to 1. The changes of
Fe with increasing Q e are not linear for particular w's. The Fe
values are negative at low w's and are coming near to Fe = 1 only at
higher w's approaching 0.5. The data in Figure 2 demonstrate all
situations in which the heterozygote remains present in the
equilibrium. The equilibrium condition is connected with a stable,
balanced polymorphism. It is obvious that the natural selection
pressures are strong: The two homozygotes must be about half or less
successful in reproduction compared with the heterozygote. The range
of 0 <= w 1 < 0.5 and 0 <= w 2 < 0.5 represents, however, only a
part of information following from the solution of equations (1) and
(2). A complete survey is given in Figure 4 where various zones of
equilibrium genotypic frequencies are demonstrated for natural
selection against zygotes within several belts of w 1 and w 2 (0, 0.2,
0.4, ... 1.6, 1.8, 2).<p>

Figure 3. Equilibrium fixation indexes, Fe, as dependent on
equilibrium frequencies of the ll homozygote, Q e, at different
adaptive values of homozygotes, w1 and w2.<p>

The zone described in detail in Figure 2 is marked by B. A special
case, A, is limited to w 1 = 0 and w 2 = 0 with H e = 1 and called
traditionally "balanced lethality". The C marked zone includes all
cases with w 1 > 0.5 and with the ultimate fixation of the ll
homozygote (P e = 1). The D marked zone includes all cases with w 2 >
0.5 and with the fixation of the ll homozygote (Q e = 1). The C and D
zones comprise not only the cases of natural selection favouring the
heterozygote and called traditionally "transitional polymorphism"
(when 0.5 <= w 1 < 1 and 0.5 <= w 2 < 1) but also those of natural
selection against the heterozygote (when w 1 > 1 and w 2 > 1). With
any "symmetrical" selection at w 1 > 0.5, w 2 > 0.5 and w 1 = w 2 (E
marked zone), the equilibrium is connected with the preservation of
the two homozygotes in the equal frequencies P e = Q e = 0.5.<p>

Figure 4. Zones of genotypic equilibria under various conditions of
natural selection expressed by means of adaptive values of
homozygotes, w1 and w2, and connected with various kinds of genetic
polymoprhism.  A: H e = 1; B: 0 = H e = 1; C: Pe = 1; D: Q e = 1; E: P
e = Q e = 0.5; F: P e = p 0, Qe = q 0 . H e = 0 within the C to F
zones.<p>

The equilibrium genotypic frequencies for all zones mentioned from A
to E are determined purely by natural selection independently of the
initial gene or genotypic frequencies. The last zone in Figure 4, F,
is connected with the absence of natural selection (w 1 = w 2 = 1).
Then P e = p 0 and Q e = q 0 where p 0 > 0 and q 0 > 0 are the initial
gene frequencies. Only under w 1 = w 2 = 1, the ultimate equilibrium
condition of populations is connected with neutral polymorphism.<p>

Therefore, diverse conditions of natural selection may lead in purely
self-fertilizing populations to genotypic equilibria connected with
various kinds of genetic polymorphism as balanced (A and B zones) or
neutral (F zone). A specific kind of polymorphism follows from
"symmetrical" selection (E zone). The cases of monomorphism are only
possible under "asymmetrical" selection (C and D zones). Transitional
polymorphism represents no typical category of genetic polymorphism in
proper sense as the ultimate equilibrium is connected with
monomorphism, too.<p>

Comparing the two stable forms of genetic polymorphism, i.e., the
balanced polymorphism as shown within the A and B zones on one hand,
and the stable polymorphism following from "symmetrical" selection as
shown within the E zone on the other, it appears advantageous to
speak, in the two diferent cases, about intrazygotic and interzygotic
stable polymorphisms, respectively. It should be kept in mind that the
latter may exist only in populations with complete self-fertilization
and strictly symmetrical response to natural selection. Even a slight
proportion of random mating or a slight downward shift of adaptive
values of homozygotes below 0.5 would lead to intrazygotic genetic
polymorphism even at nearly inappreciable equilibrium frequency of the
heterozygote.<p>

DISCUSSION<p>

The applicability of the theoretical model to real populations of A.
thaliana is largely dependent on the usefulness of accepted
preconditions with which the model was constructed. The model for
complete self-fertilization would become more complicated when a
certain proportion of random mating were considered along with
prevailing selfing. According to recent information (TRNENA et al.,
1987; CETL, 1987; TRNENA and CETL, 1988; ABBOTT and GOMES, 1988,
1989), the observed or excepted maximum proportion of random mating
does not exceed 2 x 10 -3 to 3 x 10 -3. The equilibrium condition of
populations expressed by genotypic frequencies, fixation index,
genetic load along with the resulting possibility of polymorphism
would not substantially change under these low frequencies of random
mating (cf. also HEDRICK, 1987). More conspicuous changes might be
expected under the effects of genotype-dependent and sex-dependent
mixed mating, for instance, under partial or complete male sterility
pleiotropically connected with one of the alleles considered (CETL,
1987; TRNENA and CETL, 1988; unpublished data).<p>

Serious complications may be brought about by substantial deviations
from the accepted scheme of diallelic unilocus genetic control of
flowering with a complete dominance of late over early. Gene
interaction, especially that of a dominant-suppressor type, would lead
to the recessiveness of late flowering.  Fortunately, suppressors of
this kind like that of the Dijon-G race (VETRILOVA, 1973; CETL,
1976a) were yet not found in our natural populations (OTRUBOBA and
CETL, 1985). Also in the extensive breeding experiments (unpublished)
no late flowering plants appeared among the descendants of early
flowering plants. Similar complications might also follow from some
other gene interactions occurring frequently in the crosses of
Moravian material with the S96 line from Dijon-G x Li-2 (KARLOVSKA,
1974).<p>

The metabolic pathways leading to flowering in late genotypes (cf.
NAPP-ZINN, 1979 for information) are shown to be connected with
dominance of active alleles. It is to be aware of the fact that
balanced polymorphism in the range of 0 <= w 1 < 0.5 and 0 <= w2 <
0.5 is only possible when the two pleiotropical effects of the L and l
alleles are connected with either degree of dominance in flowering
time but with superdominance in the response to natural selection.
Partial or no dominance of flowering-time genes do not change the
equilibrium condition of populations. Only intermediate phenotype will
emerge along with the two extreme classes. Thus, the simplified scheme
of the genetic control of flowering time accepted in constructing the
theoretical model appears not to be very distant from reality, at
least in the Moravian population. In spite of the complications
mentioned, the scheme seems to be acceptable for an initial approach
to the solution of the problem of polymorphism of flowering-time genes
and genecological relations in our genetic resources.<p>

Various kinds of polymorphism defined by means of the theoretical
model are, of course, of general significance. According to Figure 4,
it may be distinguished between three kinds of polymorphism. Balanced
(intrazygotic) polymorphism seems to be limited to the alleles of
flowering-time genes in our natural populations. Similar cases are yet
unknown for other genetic systems in A. thaliana. Neutral and
interzygotic polymorphism seem to be common, mainly in the cases of
allozyme genetic variation studied electrophoretically.<p>

The papers of GROVER (1975) and FUGLEWICZ and KILIAN (1985) represent
an initial effort to study electrophoretic variants in A. thaliana.
GOMES and ABBOTT (1987) and ABBOTT and GOMES (1989) were the first to
use allozyme variation for studying the population genetic structure
of A. thaliana. They found about 40 per cent of loci studied to be
polymorphic. Heterozygotes were extremely rare. Approximately the same
allele frequencies were frequent in some loci. These cases seem to
correspond to interzygotic polymorphism following from "symmetrical"
selection at very different w values equal 0.5 or higher (E zone in
Figure 4). In the opposite, rather different allele frequencies at
other loci are only possible when polymorphism appears neutral (F
zone). The cases of monomorphism follow either from real lack of other
alleles at the locus or from the selection pressures against or in
favour of homozygotes (C and D zones). It is uncertain whether the
very rare heterozygotes might be fixed in the equilibrium population.
Either certain proportion of random mating or certain natural
selection with rather low w's coming near but not reaching 0.5 (B
zone) would warrant this outcome.<p>

The application of the theoretical model to the genecological
relations within the Moravian population of A. thaliana is possible
using the distribution of population samples with respect to the
percentage of generative plants, g 28. This value is corresponding,
under accepted preconditions of the model, to the equilibrium
frequency of the ll homozygote, Q e. The distribution of these values
is given in Figure 2 and 3, last row. The distribution of g 28 is
known to be clinal (CETL, DOBROVOLNA and EFFMERTOVA, 1968; CETL,
1976a): Zero or low g 28's occur in the SE, high g 28's approaching
and reaching 1 in the NW.<p>

The initial model for complete natural selection against the early
flowering ll homozygote is valid for the SE end of the genocline only
(limited to maximum Q e = 0.2). The equilibrium frequency of the
heterozygote for flowering-time genes, H e, was determined directly in
laboratory experiments for a typical population sample of this group,
HV-3. It was possible to estimate the adaptive value of LL, w 1 =
0.4538 (CETL, 1976a, c). Then the w1's for other samples of this group
were estimated to lie, on an average, at about 0.45, i.e. near to the
upper limit of adaptive values making the equilibria possible
connected with balanced polymorphism.<p>

The present extended model was already shown to be valid in the whole
range of the equilibrium frequencies of the ll homozygote, Q e, from 0
to 1. The w values of the two homozygotes necessary to obtain
equilibria connected with balanced polymorphism and the corresponding
F e's may be read from Figures 2 and 3. No direct determination of H e
was available for the whole range of Q e. Independent estimations of H
e were used. DOBROVOLNA (1967) estimated H e in 6 samples by means
of families derived from individual plants of particular populations.
The percentages of families whose variation coefficients (v) for
flowering-time differences were over the limit of pure lines (v = 0
per cent) were 86.9, 75.6, 74.1, 73.7, 70.1, and 69.5, respectively,
i.e. about 75, at the average. Later PERINOVA and CETL, (1983)
found, by means of an F-tested comparison of flowering-time variances
in particular families with the variance of a standard line, the H e
estimates at 64.6, and 56.5, respectively, i.e. at about 60 per cent,
at the average. Extremely strong natural selection against the
homozygotes would be necessary under the high estimates of H e about
0.75. The w's would be approaching to 0 and the Fe's to -1. The L e's
would be close to maximum, L e = 0.5. Also the frequency of the ll
homozygote would be limited to low values with a maximum at Q e about
0.3. Using H e about 0.6, natural selection against the homozygotes
would be less drastic and the maximum equilibrium frequency of ll
would be at Qe about 0.4. These data suggest that the H e estimates
are unrealistically high. Analyzing the two methods of estimation, it
is clear that they are based on the whole phenotypic variation in
flowering time. Independent estimations of the coefficient of
heritability in flowering time lead to h 2 about 0.5. As the methods
lead to h 2 = VA/VP only a half of the phenotypic differences is
controlled by flowering-time genes with additive effects. Taking also
genes with other effects into account, a half of phenotypic
differences at a minimum would be controlled genetically.<p>

Thus, more realistic H e estimates would not be 0.75 or 0.6 but only
about 0.35, and only moderate natural selection would take place. The
w's and Fe's would be far higher than 0 or -1, respectively, the L e's
would be moderate, about 0.15 to 0.2. The maximum equilibrium
frequency of the ll homozygote would be extended to Q e about 0.65.
Taking these H e estimates into account, the level of selection
pressures in the central part of the genocline would be similar to
that shown by means of the initial model for the SE part of the
genocline. However, the gradually decreasing selection pressures
against ll and increasing ones against LL are to be considered in the
NW part of the genocline. Thus the equilibrium frequency of ll might
be increasing up to its limits, Qe = 1. It may be seen from Figures 2
and 3 that about 56 per cent of population samples were with g 28 >
0.8, about 45 per cent with g 28 > 0.9 and about 29 per cent with g 28
= 1.  Thus a majority of samples studied had high g 28 exceeding Q e
about 0.65 considerably.<p>

Relatively weak natural selection would be sufficient to obtain
equilibria connected with balanced polymorphism in the NW part of the
genocline: The adaptive values of ll higher than 0.45 and approaching
to 0.5, the equilibrium fixation indexes coming close t limit, Fe = 1,
the equilibrium genetic load almost negligible.  The equilibrium
frequencies of the heterozygote would be, of course, also low. For
instance, the equilibrium condition still connected with balanced
polymorphism when w 1 = 0.499 and w 2 = 0.4999 would be at H e =
0.0007, F e = 0.9958, and L e = 0.00035. In the case of Qe = 1, the ll
homozygote and the l allele is fixed. This extreme equilibrium
condition is possible under various sets of w 1 and w 2 falling
inwards the D zone shown in Figure 4. Thus the most probable
equilibrium with Qe = 1 is that maintained by means of "asymmetrical"
selection at w 2 > w 1 within the broad span of natural selection both
against and in favour of the homozygotes.<p>

The extended theoretical model appears, therefore, acceptable in
explaining the distribution of early and late flowering genotypes
within the whole genocline of Moravian A. thaliana population when the
starting preconditions of the model are accepted. The deterministic
character of the model may be, of course, an obstacle in obtaining a
true image of the highly dynamic processes bound to various
interferences with the population structure, mainly, of the processes
connected with strengthening anthropic effects. But still in its
purely deterministic version, the model is capable to suggest
relatively easy transitions from one kind of polymorphism to another
or from polymorphism to monomorphism and vice versa.<p>
