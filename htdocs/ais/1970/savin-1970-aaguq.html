Recently some attempts were made to grow Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) on
mineral mediums like vermiculite, "keramsit" and others.  According to
our experiments "miplast" a granular porous polyvinyl chloride plast,
can be commended for growing Arabidopsis.  Miplast was already used
for growing some agricultural crops in this Institute (ERMAKOW, 1964).
It has several advantages: it is light, easily aerated and has a high
moisture capacity.  Besides, miplast is sterilized well and it is
possible to maintain a relatively good homogeneity of the nutient
medium in the miplast.<p>

Arabidopsis seeds were planted in vessels 40 x 30 cm with an
interplant distance of 4 cm.  Until the rosette phase the vessels were
covered with glass and placed in larger trays full with distilled
water.  Later the plants were watered once a day, using every second
day a solution after KNOP modified by KVITKO (1960).  Under these
conditions the plants grew and developed normally and gave abundant
flowers and fruits.  When the plants were grown under constant
illumination of fluorescent lamps the vegetation period was finished
40 days after sowing.<p>
