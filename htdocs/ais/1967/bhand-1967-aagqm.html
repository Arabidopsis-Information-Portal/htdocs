	A short life cycle and a meagre water (D20) requirement by Arabidopsis thaliana should make this plant suitable for investigating the effects of partial or complete deuteriation of biologically important molecules on the growth and development of plants.<p>

	The method of cultivation was mainly after LANGRIDGE (1957).  The mineral requirements were provided as Knop's solution containing an increased quantity of KH2 PO4 (0.002 M).  Iron when incorporated in the nutrient solution was found to bring about earlier germination and better growth at the 5 ppm level than at lower concentrations.  The medium containing increasing amounts of D20, viz., 0.0 12.5, 25.0 37.5, 50.0 62.5, 75.0, and 87.5% was adjusted to pH 6.0.  The solution containing 0.75% Bacto-agar was autoclaved at 15 lbs for 15 minutes and then allowed to solidify at room temperature.<p>

	Dry surface-sterilized seeds, one seed per test tube, were inoculated under sterile conditions.  To induce uniform germination the test tubes were kept overnight at a temperature of 0-5*degrees*C and later transferred to a growth chamber maintained at 25*degrees*C and 75% relative humidity. The test tubes were kept in continuous illumination of 750 f.c. light intensity throughout the growth period. The photosynthetic supply of carbohydrates was supplemented by the addition of 2% sucrose in the nutrient medium (1500 f.d. is essential for ful photosynthetic efficiency).<p>

	Various growth and development criteria such as the germination, the appearance of leaf-pairs, floral initials and first open flower and the number of flowers, seeds, etc., were exmained. viability tests were carried out for the seeds obtained from various treatments by germinating on nutrient medium with normal water.  The results are presented in Tables 1 and 2 and the salient findings briefly described.<p>

	A delay in germination was a function of increasing D2O concentration being maximal in 50% D2O.  Higher concentrations proved to be too toxic to give any germination (Table 1).  Similarly, appearance of leaf-pairs was retarded by D2) which at 50% concentration completely inhibited growth beyond third leaf-pair stage. This complete inhibition of growth could have resulted due to very high degree of chlorosis induced by D2O.<p>

	There was a general delay in the appearance of various leaf-pairs, floral initials and first open flower (Table 1).  The extent of delay increased not only with increase in D20 concentration but also generally with progressive growth stages of plant.<p>

	There was a reduction in the number of open flowers per plant in the treated plants, a reduction which was more or less a function of the concentration of D20 (Table 2).  There was hardly any difference in seed weights between seeds obtained from H20 and D20 grown plants (Table 2).  Similarly, the seeds from D20 cultures were found to be just as viable as those obtained from normal (H20) cultures.<p>

Table 2:  Developmental data.  (The figures in parentheses give percent of control.)<p>

	Looking to the number of seeds obtained per plant in different treatments and comparing them with the corresponding flower number (Table 2), it appears that although the total seed number was less in any D20 treatment, yet seed / flower ratio steadily rose from about 3.4 in controls to 6.9 in 37.5% D20.  This could be the result of an increase in number of fertilized flowers and/or of seeds per fertilized flower in D20 treated plants.  Further investigations are planned to obtain more definite information on this question.<p>
