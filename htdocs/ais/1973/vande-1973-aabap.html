<h2> Double reduction in tetraploid Arabidopsis thaliana, studied by means of a chlorophyll mutant with a distinct simplex phenotype</h2><p>

Netherlands)<p>

A dozen tetraploid M2-lines were kindly provided by Miss BALKEMA in
this Department (cf. BALKEMA, 1971, 1972).  She had put seeds of the
early flowering pure line Landsberg-'erecta' on filterpaper (in
Petridishes), soaked with a solution containing 10 mMol EMS and 0.2%
colchicine. After 24 hours at 24*degrees*C in the dark, the seeds were
rinsed and put to germinate on agar at 24*degrees*C undr TL, and on
the 7th day the seedlings were transplanted to the greenhouse
(22*degrees*C).  Harvesting on the M1-plants was from side-branches
(or from a higher part of the main influorescence), which were
non-chimeric tetraploid in the sporocyte tissue (judged from pollen
size), and which in addition segregated albina's (embryo test).<p>

We confirmed from the M2-seedlings that these segregations were
duplex-type (AAaa selfed), i.e., the mutations were induced on the
"chromosome level" (G1).  Of course, mutations induced on the
"chromatid level" (G2) will have escaped detection, since in
triplex-type segregations (AAAa selfed) recessives (aaaa) derive from
double reduction and consequently are rare.<p>

As also observed by BOUHARMONT, the tetraploids are of excellent
vigour (cf. BALKEMA, 1965), and are very stable (cf. BALKEMA, 1967),
i.e., off-types are rare in successive generations.<p>

Compared with the diploid control, seedset is 40-60%, which explains
the shorter siliquae.  This reduction is almost entirely due to
non-fertilized ovules. Triploids, obtained by reciprocal crosses
between the diploid control and the tetraploid line ultimately
selected by us (see below), have 20-30% (!) seedset, which reduction
is, compared with the tetraploid, equally due to less ovules per fruit
and an increased fraction of non-fertilized ovules. The seeds of these
triploids contain 30-40% embryonic lethals (seedcoat prematurely
brown, embryotest).  Cf. 1-2% for the diploid and 2-3% for the
tetraploid parent.<p>

From M2 till M5 we carried out line and subline selection, to improve
uniform vitality and fertility, to select against simultaneously
induced mutants (including embryonic lethals) and to decide which
albina had best fenotypic expression both as embryo and as seedling.
Ultimately, a very satisfactory line was chosen, which also has no
recessive deficit in the embryo-test (although germination of the
albina's is sometimes incomplete), and which has the unique feature of
distinct simplex expression: young Aaaa plants are light green, AAaa
plants normal green. Simplex embryo's and seedlings cannot be
distinguished. Attempts with nutrient medium in perlite to accellerate
simplex expression seem promising.  In this selected line, also a
fusca-mutant (purplish discoloration in the embryo's) is carried on.
This non-germinating recessive segegates independently of the albina.<p>

Denoting the coefficient of double reduction by c, the frequencies of
AA, Aa, aa gametes are<p>

for triplex (AAAa) resp.  (2+c)/4,  2(1-c)/4,  c/4
for duplex (AAaa) resp.  (1+2c)/6,  4(1-c)/6,  (1+2c)/6
for simplex (Aaaa) resp.  c/4,  2(1-c)/4,  (2+c)/4<p>

From theoretical considerations and from data in literature, a
reasonable maximum value for c is 1/8.<p>

The most direct evidence for double reduction and consequently a
direct estimate for c comes from triplex-plants. Selfing gives
maximally 1/1024 aaaa, which even with the embryo-test is laborious
scoring. Crosses with the (lethal) nulliplexes are not possible.
However, the distinct simplex phenotype greatly increases the
efficiency of estimation (for c=1/8, triplex produces 1/32 aa gametes,
resp. 1/32 simplex offspring).<p>

The results of our embryo-tests on simplexes and duplexes are
presented below.  BOUHARMONTs (1969) data have been added (locus
denoted here by B-b).<p>

The double reduction estimates from duplexes are somewhat higher, for
which we have no ready explanation.  It is clear that BOUHARMONT's
mutant suffers from a recession deficit and therefore is unsuitable
for the estimation of c.  Of course, in our material the estimates of
c may be somewhat deflated by (e.g. gametic) selection. To study this,
reciprocal crosses were made between 41 pairs of duplex and simplex
plants.  The fraction simplex among non-albina plants is
4(1-c2)/16-2c-c2), which ratio is insensitive to c (see expectations
for c + 0 and c = 1/8 below).  The albina's are not included, since
their germination is variable.<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol10/vol10-pg12-tab1.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

We conclude that selection, if any, plays only a minor role.  If
gametic, than it seems equal for female and male gametogenesis.<p>

Selfing-seed from the same 41 triplex plants was sown and resulted in:
12211 normal green, 276 light green, 8 albina (for c=0 only normal
green's are expected).  Neglecting the few albina's this leads via the
fraction c (1-c)/4 light green's to c=0.10.  For this c-value the
number of expected albina's is 8 (a perfect fit).<p>

Since no crosses triplex x nulliplex can be made, a possibility to
study the selective difference, if any, between female and male
gametogenesis resp. gametes is the reciprocal cross triplex x diploid.
Extensive scoring is under way.  First the expression of the triploid
simplexes (Aaa) had to be studied. For this purpose 10 pairs of
simplex and diploid plants were reciprocally crossed (the number of
progeny reflects the differences in seedset between 2n and 4n):<p>

AA x Aaaa gave 351 normal green and 365 light green, Aaaa x AA gave
142 normal green and 156 light green.  As even the joint data do not
significantly deviate from 1:1 (expected for c=0), there is no point
in estimating c.<p>

The distinction light green versus normal green is in triploids by far
not as clear as in tetraploids, and in diploids (from 2n x 3n and 3n x
2n) phenotypic distinction between Aa and AA becomes uncertain.
Therefore, it seems that apart for the number of A- alleles, also the
ratio between A and a-alleles affects the expression of leaf colour.<p>
