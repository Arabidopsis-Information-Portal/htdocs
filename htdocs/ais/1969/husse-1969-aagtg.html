HUSSEIN (1968) identified 20 X-ray and EMS-induced single-gene
flowering time mutations (see also HUSSEIN and VAN DER VEEN, 1968), by
means of diallel crosses within 5 groups of mutants, based on parent
of origin (line C or line 51), direction of change, and magnitude of
change.  Line 51 is a single-gene mutant (e1e1) towards late from line
C.  Linkage groups established from this study (HUSSEIN, 1968) are:<p>

N.B.  No inferences were made about the linear order.  It is seen that
(C) and (D) form one linkage group (e1/13/X2/V6).<p>

Additional crosses between mutant lines of different diallel sets were
made during the summer and autumn 1968 (Dept. Genetics, Wageningen).
The data (F1's and F2's) so far analysed, revealed that (A) and (B)
belong to one linkage group (e3/e4/e7/e8).<p>

As the character (flowering time) studied shows much overlapping
variation, special methods were adopted for identification of the
single genes (cf. HUSSEIN, 1968).  Even though, only relatively close
linkages could be detected.  Since so much linkage was found among the
20 mutations, it is concluded that the loci involved are not evenly
distributed all over the genome (2n=10), but rather occur in clusters.<p>
