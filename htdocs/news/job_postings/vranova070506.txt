2 PhD POSITIONS IN PLANT SECONDARY METABOLISM
ETH ZÜRICH, SWITZERLAND *

We are seeking engaged and highly qualified graduate students to join the Isoprenoid Pathway project in the 
Plant Biotechnology Group <http://www.pb.ethz.ch/> (Prof. Wilhelm Gruissem) at the ETH Zürich.

The successful candidates will study function of isozymes at the metabolic branchpoint in the isopreniod 
pathway using /Arabidopsis /as a model plant together with genetic dissection, functional genomics approaches 
and metabolite analysis. The project is part of the larger initiative in our laboratory that aims to understand 
cellular network of isoprenoid biosynthesis <http://www.pb.ethz.ch/research/isoprenoid>.

Ideal candidate should have diploma (M.Sc.) in biology, biochemistry or similar qualification. She or he should 
be interested in plant metabolism and its regulation and be prepared to work in a competitive field. Previous 
experience with plant molecular biology, metabolite analysis and functional genomics is an advantage. Advanced 
knowledge of English is expected.

We offer training in the young, dynamic and highly qualified international research team and access to the up to 
date research facilities.

The positions are available immediately and project is supported financially for three years by the ETH Zürich. 
If you are interested in these positions, please send your CV, a motivation letter and three names of referees 
by e-mail to *Dr. Eva Vranová * (evranova@ethz.ch <mailto:evranova@ethz.ch>), from whom further information 
can be obtained.
