<h2> The changes of width of cotyledons with increasing vernalization rate in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) HEYNH.</h2><p>

I. CETL and Marta KRSKOVA<p>

(Department of Genetics, Purkyne University, Brno, Czechoslovakia)<p>

In cereals, the size of the coleoptile and of the few first leaves
diminishes with increasing vernalization rate (PURVIS, 1934;
CAJLACHJAN and ZDANOVA, 1938; THIMANN and LANE, 1938; HANSEL, 1953;
CETL, 1962).<p>

In this preliminary experiment, it was searched for similar phenomena
in Arabidopsis.  As has been found in former experiments, the width of
the cotyledons is a well definable quantity while the length is less
advantageous as it cannot be precisely bordered against the petiole.
At the same time it was stated that both dimensions increase during
the early stages of growth till the first two true leaves reach
approximately the size of the cotyledons.  After this stage, the
dimensions of the cotyledons changes no more (unpublished data).<p>

For this reason, the changes of width of cotyledons with increasing
vernalization rate were studied in a late line Je 31-5-3-4.  The seeds
were vernalized for 0 (control), 10, 20, 31, 49, and 60 days.  When
the third true leaf appeared the width of the cotyledons was measured
in single plants and expressed as a mean (w) for each variant.  Later
the mean number of days to appearance of flower primordia (x) and of
rosette leaves (y) were similarly determined.  (For technical
procedures and conditions of cultivation see CETL,
RELICHOVA-DOBROVOLNA, and KRSKOVA, 1970).<p>

The results are given in the Table.  As can be seen, all three
quantities studied decreased with increasing vernalization rate. The
decrease till the 20th or 30th day of vernalization was very fast
while afterwards it was relatively slow. This means that not only the
two characters, directly connected with the development, but also the
width of cotyledons diminished in the same way as a consequence of
vernalization.<p>

Table: Changes in the mean number of days to appearance of flower
primordia (x) in the mean number of rosette leaves (y) and in the mean
width of cotyledons in mm (w) with increasing vernalization rate that
not only the two characters directly connected with the development,
but also the width of cotyledons diminished in the same way as a
consequence of vernalizaation.<p>

Highly significant positive correlation coefficients were found
between the three characters: Between the mean (x) values and the mean
(y) values: r = 0,9952, P &lt; 0,01; between the mean (x) values and the
mean (w) values: r = 0,9267, P &lt; 0,01; between the mean (y) values and
the mean (w) values: r = 0,9406, P &lt; 0,01.  Therefore, the
decrease in all three quantities during vernalization was directly
proportional to each other.  From the physiological point of view it
might be of interest to study the corresponding causal relations.<p>

In any case, the changes of the width of the cotyledons with
increasing vernalization rate in Arabidopsis represent a phenomenon of
the same expressivity as similar changes in the first leaves of
cereals.<p>
