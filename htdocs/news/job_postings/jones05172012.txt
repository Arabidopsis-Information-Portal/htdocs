3 Post Doctoral Positions in Cell Biology are immediately available for highly-motivated individuals 
to study in vivo spatial and temporal changes in signaling elements of the heterotrimeric G-protein 
pathway in Arabidopsis. Arabidopsis has become the most tractable model system for study of the 
G-protein signal pathway in a multicellular eukaryote. The candidate will have available a large 
set of genetic and microscopy tools to address a novel signaling mechanism within a classic signaling 
paradigm. The candidate must have experience in fluorescence microscopies, including FRET analysis 
and/or biochemistries including protein purification and characterization. Knowledge of or experience 
with Arabidopsis is not necessary but useful. Excellent verbal, written, and interpersonal skills are 
essential. The candidate must be fluent in English. Salaries start at $36,200/yr plus benefits 
commensurate with experience. Please email cover letter and curriculum vitae to Dr. Alan Jones, 
alan_jones@unc.edu<mailto:alan_jones@unc.edu>. The University of North Carolina is an Equal 
Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer.
