A group of four independent, late flowering, vernalizable mutations
(L4 to L7) induced in the genetic background of the early flowering
Dijon-G (Di-G) genotype was shown to carry a dominant allele for later
flowering, L, along with the background genotype. In Di-G, however,
the effect of this allele was suppressed by an at least partially
dominant allele S. Thus, the late flowering mutants might have arisen
by a recessive S to s mutation, and have been of the ssLL genotype,
in contrast to the SSLL genotype of Di-G (Vetrilova, 1973; Cetl,
1976).<p>

For this reason, Di-G appears to be a "dominant early flowering"
genotype. It was interesting to find out whether various early
flowering lines from Moravian natural populations were "dominant early
flowering" or "recessive early flowering". A duplex genetic analysis
was used by means of crossing the unknown early flowering genotypes
with Di-G (SSLL) on one hand and the former with L6 (ssLL) on the
other.<p>

Generally, the early flowering genotypes could be of three different
kinds when the two loci, S and L, were taken into account: (1) SSLL,
(2) SSll, and (3) ssll. These three possibilities could be considered
according to the specific behaviour of the unknown early flowering
genotypes in the duplex genetic analyses. In absence of linkage
between S and L, the occurrence of early (e) and (l) flowering
genotypes should be as follows:<p>

Under the absence of linkage, it would be difficult to distinguish
between the (1) SSLL and (2) SSll "dominant early flowering" genotypes
as there is no difference in the (a) crosses, and the two F 2 ratios
in the (b) crosses, namely 3 e :1 1 and 13 e : 3 1, are similar.
Assuming linkage between S and L at p = .3 and p = .1 in repulsion
(2b), the frequency of early and late flowering plants in the F 2
would change as follows:<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol22/vol22-pg100-fig0a.gif">Click here for figure</a><p>

The discrimination between (1) and (2) would become more difficult due
to the increasing strength of linkage between S and L.<p>

On the contrary, it would be relatively easy to distinguish between
the two "dominant early flowering" genotypes (1) and (2) on one hand
the "recessive early flowering" genotypes (3) on the other. Assuming
linkage between S and L at p = .3 and p = .1 in coupling (3a) the
frequency of early and late flowering F 2 plants would be the
following:<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol22/vol22-pg100-fig0b.gif">Click here for figure</a><p>

Increasing strength of linkage between S and L would lead to a
considerable decrease in the frequency of the late flowering class.<p>

Plants of ten independent, uniform, early flowering lines from natural
populations Da and Jm (Perinova and Cetl, 1983) were crossed with the
Di-G and L6 genotypes, respectively, without reciprocals. The pollen
of Di-G and of L6 was laid on the stigmata of the carefuly emasculated
flowers of the early flowering Da and Jm lines. Several tens of F 1
seeds were used to get, under natural autogamy, as many as possible
seeds to grow the F 2 plants along with their parental lines and their
F 1 plants under analytical experimental conditions (25+/-3*degrees*C,
continuous illumination).<p>

The combined score for each P 1, P 2, F 1, and F 2 plant in all
combinations was calculated, z = log (x+y), where x was the number of
days from emergence to the appearance of flower primordia and y the
number of rosette leaves. Then the P 1, P 2, F 1, and F 2
distributions for all combinations were constructed. he positions of
minima separating the group of early flowering plants from that of the
later flowering plants were found on the F 2 distributions of z with
respect to the positions of the narrow distributions of P 1, P 2 and F
1. The minima occurred in all cases within the interval z = 1.35 to
1.40. Then the number of early and late flowering F 2 plants were
determined and the observed numerical ratios compared with those
expected for (1), (2), and (3). In the combinations with L6, the
number of F 1 and F 2 plants which did not show the flower primordia
up to the 28th day from emergence were added to the late flowering
group.<p>

The F1 means of the combined score were low in the crosses with Di-G
and high in the crosses with L6, where, in addition, plants with x>28
days also occurred (V) (Table 1). It could be concluded that all early
flowering lines from the Da and Jm populations were (3) ssll. This
conclusion corresponded to the results obtained in F 2 where the
observed numerical ratios of early and late flowering plants were in
agreement, at least in the majority of combinations, with the 13 e : 3
1 and 1 e : 3 1 expected numerical ratios. The direction of deviations
from the expectation was the same in all exceptional cases: &#160;The
late flowering plants were in excess.<p>

Table 1: F1 means of the combined score with the standard error, z +/-
s z, in the 10 x 2 combinations.<p>

The homogeneity of numerical ratios within the lines of the same
population and within all lines could not be proved in all cases. The
cause was, obviously, the excess of late flowering plants in F 2 of
some combinations (Table 2). The excess of late flowering plants was,
probably, connected with higher relative viability of late flowering
genotypes (ssLL, ssL1), at least in a part of combinations, ie.., on
certain genetic backgrounds. "Supervitality" of late flowering mutants
was known long ago (Redei, 1962).<p>

Table 2: F2 numerical ratios of early (e) and late (l) flowering
plants in the 10 x 2 combinations along with the X 2 (1) for the
expected ratios 13 e : 3 1 (in the crosses with Di-G) and 1 e : 3 1
(in the crosses with L6), respectively, and with the X 2 (4) and X 2
(9) values for homogeneity.<p>

The presence of linkage between S and L seems to be improbable. A
decrease in the frequency of late flowering plants would take place in
the combinations with Di-G under linkage. As shown above, an adverse
tendency was observed due to the increased relative viability of later
flowering genotypes, an the presence of linkage could not be
overlapped entirely. Thus, the conclusion that the group of early
flowering lines from the Da and Jm populations does not carry any
dominant or partially dominant alleles at the two flowering-time loci
S and L and that the two loci are independent seems to be probable.
The early flowering lines studied appear as "recessive early
flowering".<p>

The method of the duplex genetic analysis seems to represent a
convenient tool to the experimental study of the geographical
variation of the flowering time genes not only in the S-L system but
also in analogous systems.<p>
