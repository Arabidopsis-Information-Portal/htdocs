(Medium to Large Scale)

1. CTAB BUFFER
 500 ml-1
140mM Sorbitol 12.8 g
220mM Tris, pH 8 55 ml of 2M
22mM EDTA 22 ml of 0.5M
800mM NaCl 80 ml of 5M
1%  Sarkosyl 5 g
0.8%  CTAB 4 g
Combine, check pH = 8, autoclave.

2.  EXTRACTION
  (i)  Grind 2 to 5 g of frozen leaves to a very fine powder using N2 cooled 
mortar and pestle.
  (ii) Add 25 ml CTAB buffer and transfer to 50 ml tube.
  (iii) Incubate at 65oC for 20 min, with occasional vigorous shaking.
  (iv) Add 10 ml chloroform, shake well, place on inverter at r.t. for 20 min.
  (v) Centrifuge 3,000 rpm for 5 min to resolve phases.
  (vi) Transfer aqueous phase to fresh tube, add 17 ml isopropanol, mix, 
place on ice for 10 min.
  (vii) Centrifuge 3,000 rpm for 5 min to collect precipitate.
  (viii) Drain liquid, dry sides of tube using blue roll.  Do not dry pellet.
  (ix) Add 4 ml TE, dissolve precipitate by gentle pipetting.
  (x) Add 4 ml 4 M LiAc, incubate on ice for 20 min.
  (xi) Centrifuge 3,000 rpm for 10 min.
  (xii) Transfer supernatant to fresh tube, add 16 ml ethanol, place on ice 
for 20 min.
  (xiii) Centrifuge 3,000 rpm for 5 min to collect precipitate.
  (xiv) Drain liquid, dry sides of tube using blue roll.  Do not dry pellet.
  (xv) Dissolve DNA in 0.9 ml TE by gently pipetting
  (xvi) Add 100 ul 3M NaAc, divide into 2 microcentrifuge tubes
  (xvii) Extract with 0.5 ml phenol, then phenol/chloroform, then 
chloroform.
 *  The aqueous phase may be denser than phenol alone, be sure to 
recover the colourless  phase.  Shake tubes to mix rather than vortexing.

  (xviii) Add 2 volumes of ethanol, place on ice for 5 min.
  (xix) Centrifuge 5 min to collect precipitate.
  (xx) Drain liquid, centrifuge for a further 5 min, remove as much of the 
remaining liquid as possible using a pipette.  Do not dry pellet.
  (xxi) Add 100 to 250 ul TE.  Dissolve pellet by gentle pipetting.
 *  As there is still some ethanol present, extra loading buffer may be 
needed to run this DNA  on a gel.  DNA yields should be at least 5 ugg-1 
of leaves.


3.  RESTRICTION DIGESTS (for Southern transfer)
  (i) Perform digests on 2 ug aliquots of DNA in 400 ul volume.  Use 50 U 
enzyme if possible, include 1ul of 20 mg/ml BSA, incubate for 4 hours.
  (ii) Add 40 ul NaAc and precipitate DNA by adding 1 ml of ethanol, 
incubate on ice or at -20oC for at least 1 hour.
  (iii) Collect ppt by centrifugation for 5 min, remove liquid, spin for a 
further 5 min, remove liquid.  Do not dry pellet.
  (iv) Dissolve DNA in 15 ul TE by gentle pipetting.
  (v) Add 10 ul loading buffer and load carefully on a 0.7 % agarose gel.
 *  Watch for the  DNA  sample floating.  If this happens, more loading 
buffer should be added.
