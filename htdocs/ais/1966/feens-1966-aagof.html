	In a previous communication, results of recombination experiments between genes py-1^2 and py-2^1 were mentioned (FEENSTRA, 1965).  The amount of work, involved in crossing the heterozygous py-1^2/py-2^1 plants by the homozygous py-d tester line was the bottle-neck in testing a large number of gametes.<p>

	F2-families on mineral medium segregate in deficient and semi-wild plants (1:1), the latter being only distinguishable from true wild type plants (recombinants) in a late growing stage.  Since it was considered probable that semi-wild and true wild plants have different thiamine levels, experiments were set up to find a medium that would differentiate between them at an early stage, by means of a thiamine antagonist.<p>

	Since py-mutants are blocked in the synthesis of the pyrimidine part of the thiamine molecule, an inhibitor had to be chosen which does not contain this moiety, because otherwise it will be used as a nutrient (REDEI, 1960).  Therefore oxythiamine, containing 4-hydroxy- instead of 4-amino-pyrimidine, was employed.<p>

	Genotypes py-2^1/py-1^2, +/py-1^2 and py-2^1/+ were obtained by appropriate crosses and tested on an oxythiamine concentration series of 0, 1, 2, 4 etc - 64 mg/100 ml mineral nutrient solution.  Oxythiamine being a rather labile compound, the seeds got a pre-sowing cold-treatment, in order to start germination and growth on a freshly prepared substrate.  As is shown in Figure 1, the py-1^2/py-2^1 type is strongly inhibited on the concentrations 4 and 8 mg/100 ml, whereas the +/py2^1 type still grows fairly well.  At high antagonist levels both types are equally strongly inhibited. Type py-2^1/+ reacted like type +/py-1^2.<p>

	This method is now being used for the detection of possible
recombinants in the F2 of the cross py-1^2 x py-2^1.  If such plants can be found, testing of the segregation in the next generation will have to provide the final proof of the genotype of the plants isolated.<p>
