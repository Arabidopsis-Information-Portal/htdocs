The variability of the number of days to appearance of the flower
primordia (x), of the number of rosette leaves (y), and of the number
of rosette leaves per day (y/x) was studied in 19 different races
without or with only a quantitative vernalization requirement (4
samples from the exchange service of the botanical gardens, 6 lines A1
from the west- moravian populations, 8 races from the collection of
Prof. F. LAIBACH, Limburg, and 1 race from the collection of Dr. M.
SOSNA, Praha).  Plants from unvernalized and vernalized seed (2 weeks
at +2+1*degree*C) were grown at 25 +3*degrees*C in continuous
illumination (1250 lux) for 84 days.  The quantitative vernalization
requirement ascertained in another experiment in some races was fully
covered by the used vernalization.<p>

There exist significant racial differences in control as well as in
vernalized plants in all three characteristics.  In the vernalized
plants, the variability between and within races decreases
significantly only in the number of days (x) and rosette leaves (y),
while in the rosette leaves per day (y/x) this decrease is not
significant.  Thus, the y/x ratio is not changing by vernalization and
represents an important racial constant.<p>

On the given basis, it is possible to search for suitable races in
which the negative correlation between the earliness and the fertility
is expressed in a minimal degree.  For genetic experiments in
artificial conditions early forms with high y/x ratio appear to be
ideal; in our material, e.g., the line B5 with xo(avg) = 13,4 s =
(+-)2,00 and xo(avg)/yo(avg) = 0,49 s = (+-)0,065.<p>
