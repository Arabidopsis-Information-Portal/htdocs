The Carnegie Institution,  Department of Biology offers summer research experiences to 
undergraduates from Stanford and other institutions (including local community colleges and 
state Universities). Summer research experiences for undergraduates run for 8-10 weeks 
during the summer. Students are expected to work full-time during the summer (40 hours/week).

The Carnegie Undergraduate Science Program includes: A summer seminar series for undergraduates 
and an Undergraduate Student Research Symposium. During the summer, students gather for weekly
meetings/seminars and prepare presentations for the Undergraduate Research Symposium held at 
the end of the summer. Seminars typically involve informal presentations by post-doctoral 
fellows and graduate students and discussion. At the summer research symposium, summer 
interns present posters  about their research to the department.
