Crown gall tumour cells have the ability to grow on culture medium
without added growth hormones. As non-cloned tumour tissue is a
mixture of normal and tumourous cells (Sacristan and Melchers, 1977),
a selection for the tumour cell clones should be possible by growing
protoplasts at low densities on medium without added growth hormones.<p>

In literature it is reported that grown gall tumour cell protoplasts
do need added growth hormones for the first division (e.g. Scowcroft
et al., 1973). For Arabidopsis thaliana tumour tissues (Aerts et al.,
1979), however, we have been able to isolate two independent clones of
ACH5 tumour cells by protoplast culture on medium without growth
hormones. Protoplats were isolated and cultured according to the
method of Power and Davey (1979), but using PG on medium (Negrutiu et
al., 1975) instead of B5. Every three weeks the microcolonies were
transferred to medium with decreasing concentration of mannitol and
finally cultures on ordinary PG o medium. In both cases only one
colony developed into a green callus. The presence of octopine proved
the tumourous state of these clones (Bomhoff et al., 1976). After
about one year of in vitro culture of these crown gall cells lines as
undifferentiated, green tissue, part of it spontaneously
redifferentiated into teratomata and plants with normal morphology,
which still contain octopine. We now are waiting for seed production
to study that fate of the T-DNA in the next generation.<p>

The fact that in both cases only one of the oiginally dense growing
microcolonies and for other independent tumour lines any of the
microcolonies developed further into green callus tissue means that we
still have to look for the optimal culture conditions. Anyway it has
been shown that isolated tumour cell protoplasts even for the first
divisions are able to grow on medium without growth hormones and that
this technique is suited for selective cloning of crown gall tumour
cells.<p>
