	Dry F2 seeds obtained from F1 hybrids between a hairless mutant (gl1) and the wild hairy strain of race Landsberg were subjected to gamma-rays and heavy ionizing particles.  F2 seeds were used because it is somewhat difficult to obtain many F1 seeds.  Irradiation with heavy particles was carried out at the Hilac (heavy ion linear accelerator) by courtesy of Dr. J. T. LYMAN, University of California. Dry seeds were subjected to 1 to 5 krad of He4 and C12 ions, respectively, and 3 and 5 krad of Ar40 ions, initial particle energy being 41.6, 124.8 and 416 MeV, respectively.  For comparison of RBE values and establishment of a standard, 28- and 47 krad gamma-ray exposures were given to the same material with 10 kr/h intensity from 6 kc of 137 Cs source in our institute.<p>

	The average seed volume was calculated roughly from the weight and measurement of length and width of the seeds.  From this calculation it was concluded that Ar-ions must be stopped within the seeds but He- and C-ions certainly penetrate and pass through seed tissue.<p>

	Germination and survival rates in the control and in two gamma-ray lots were very good.  Survival rates decreased markedly with increasing dosage in the heavy-ion lots, especiall those treated with He-ions.<p>

	Hairless homozygotes segregated according to the ratio of 3 : 1, as expected.  (Segregation ratio in the Ar-ion 5 krad lot seems to be due to an experimental error.)  Therefore, about 67 percent of hairy plants may be assumed to be heterozygotes for the hairy-hairless allele pair. To find somatic mutation from dominant hairy to recessive hairless we had to look among those plants.  The frequency of plants with hairless sectors increased with increasing dosage in gamma-ray, C-ion and Ar-ion lots as shown in Table 1.  On the other hand, only one mutated plant was observed in the H-ion 2 krad lot.  A non-linear relation taking the shape of an exponential curve was observed between mutation frequency and gamma-ray dosage.  In heavy-particle treatments, the frequency-versus-dosage relation was fairly linear.  The frequencies of somatic mutations by gamma-rays and heavy ionizing particles were compared at 0.5 percent mutation rates from their dose-versus-frequency curves.  About 33 krad of gamma-rays were necessary for producing the 0.5 percent mutation rate, and about 0.9 and 6.7 krad of C- and Ar-ions could produce the same mutation frequency.  From the results, RBE for somatic muation at 0.5 percent frequency was roughly estimated as 35 for C-ions and 6 for Ar-ions.  We could not decide about the RBE of He-ions; but if the mutation rate at the 2 krad lot was sutained then this RBE for somatic mutation might be about 10.<p>
