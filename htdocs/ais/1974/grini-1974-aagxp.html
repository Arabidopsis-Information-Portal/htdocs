The problem of chimerism in generative tissue in A. thaliana is of
much importance (MULLER 1965, BALKEMA 1970, HARLE 1972 and others).
In this paper the pattern of the occurence of the mutated tissue in
different influorescences has been analysed using MULLER's embryo
test.<p>

X1-plants were grown from x-ray-irradiated seeds (50 kr) in soil under
continuous illumination at 24+/-2*degrees*C.  Since chimerism occurred
already within the range of the first to the sixth pods, the
influorescences with more than six pods were taken.  Plants having
normal main influorescences were removed.<p>

In 19 out of 61 x1-plants (=31.2+/-5.03 p.c.) there were mutations.
They were separated into two groups: i) with chimeric, ii) with
non-chimeric main influorescences of apical shoot. The average mutated
sector size of the first group of plants was constant in the main,
lateral order I and order II influorescences: 62.6, 63.2 and 60.2
resp.  The rate of the chimeric influorescences decreased with
increasing of their order: 100.0, 40.0 and 19.6p.c. resp., i.e. the
separation of mutated and non-mutated tissues between lateral
influorescences occurred without any advantage of the tissues. The
second group of plants were also non-chimeric in lateral order I and
order II influorescences. (Table 1).<p>

Table 1: The mutated sector size (number of pods) in generative tissue
of apical shoots with chimeric main influorescences.<p>

Fasciated main influorescences have been analysed in a different way:
viable mutations in x2 and lethal mutations in x3 were scored among
the progeny of every pod.  The same mutation segregated frequently in
both parts of the influorescence, i.e., they had a common initial
cell(s).<p>

Evidence has been obtained that additional shoots (1.3 pr plant in our
experiment) originated from the same intital as the apical shoot.<p>
