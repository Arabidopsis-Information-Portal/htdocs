Single-gene differences for early versus different degrees of late
have been reported by e.g., HARER (1951) DIERKS (1958), and NAPP-ZINN
(1962).  Modifiers may play a role, in some environments more than in
others.  NAPP-ZINN (1963) adopts the same explanation for his
heterotic early x (medium) late cross Li-5xZurich (zu).<p>

From the F2 of the heterotic early x (less) early cross Dijon (Di) x
Li-2, I could select 2 classes of new homozygotes, an early class (not
heterotic with either parent) and a late class (giving 1 early: 3 late
with both parents).  Greenhouse data (in days) are:<p>

Proof for two complementary-like major genes was obtained by comparing
(in autumn!) position of peaks in F2-frequency distribution with those
of the 4 homozygous, all F1's, and the 4 backcrosses. This led to 6
phenotypes of the theoretical F2 ratio (4 : 3) : (4 : 2 : 2 : 1).  In
the second group, A acts stronger than B, but in the first group, only
B-b can be classified.<p>

A third gene C is being traced now, which would be complementary to B
again, but not to A.  Under the hypothesis B is the basic gene for
late flowering.<p>

More (preliminary) details will be presented at the 1st international
Arabidopsis Symposium held at Gottingen in April 1965.<p>
