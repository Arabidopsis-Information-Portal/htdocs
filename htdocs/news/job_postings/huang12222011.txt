A postdoctoral position is immediately available in the Department of Plant 
and Soil Sciences at Oklahoma State University. This postdoctoral research 
fellow will join a cooperative research project to fine map and clone a 
major QTL for resistance to greenbug (i.e. aphid) in sorghum (Theor. Appl. 
Genet. 117:117-124). The postdoctoral fellow will work in the USDA-ARS 
research laboratory of Dr. Yinghua Huang in collaboration with Dr. Liuling 
Yan of Oklahoma State University at Stillwater. The incumbent will design 
and implement research experiments to develop gene markers to saturate the 
QTL region, identify and map candidate genes, and characterize genetic 
mechanisms of greenbug resistance in sorghum. 



The successful applicant should have a strong background in genetics, 
molecular biology, plant breeding, or related discipline. Experience in QTL 
analysis, construction of genetic and physical maps, and annotation and 
application of genomic sequences are desirable. Documented ability to 
communicate effectively in English both writing research publication and 
spoken language is required. Review of applications will begin December 25, 
2011, and continue until the position is filled. 



Please send a letter of research interest and professional goals, 
curriculum vitae, and contact information for three references by email to: 
yinghua.huang@ars.usda.gov or liuling.yan@okstate.edu.
