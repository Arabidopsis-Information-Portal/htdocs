Vol 01:<h2>REDEI, G. P.</h2><h2>Additional thiamin requiring mutants</h2>

It has been already reported briefly (REDEI 1960, 1962a) that a
pyrimidine and also a thiazole requiring mutant have been found.
Since, two more thiazole requiring mutants have been identified in 5-
bromouracil treated material.  It is unlikely that the analog played
any part in the induction, while contamination is unlikely because the
material was genetically marked.  The three thiazole requiring mutants
are allelic.  More recently a new allelic pyrimidine mutant was also
detected in an X-rayed progeny.  Thus the total number of our thiamin
responding mutants is 5.  The pyrimidine locus belongs to linkage
group 2, the thiazole locus is perhaps loosely linked to one of our
fourth linkage group markers.  In higher plants this material provides
unique opportunities to study such phenomena as reverse mutation,
pseudoallism, allelic complementation etc.<p>
