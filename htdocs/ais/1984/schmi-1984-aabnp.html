INTRODUCTION<p>

The earliest recognized and most extensively studied effect of
gibberellins in plants is the promotion of shoot growth. This effect
is most easily demonstrated when genetic dwarf forms of plants are
treated with gibberellic acid (GA 3) and the plants grow on the same
height as normal forms.<p>

The dwarf characteristic is ascribed to a failure of the plants to
synthesize adequate amounts of gibberellin because of an interruption
in the normal biosynthetic pathway. Compounds which interfere with
this pathway and thus lead to plants with minimal levels of endogenous
gibberellin may be termed antigibberellins. Ancymidol
(*alpha*-cyclopropyl-*alpha* (4-methoxyphenyl)-5-pyrimidinemethanol)
is reported to have such an effect: when plants are sprayed with
solutions of this material, normal height is not attained.<p>

The effect of Ancymidol applied to intact plants were studied by Homes
et al. (1975) who found that shortened Easter lily plants could be
induced with a soil drench of Ancymidol. Yopp et al. (1979) treated
etiolated mung bean hypocotyls with Ancymidol and found that GA
3-induced elongation was reduced. Cell-free extracts of immature Marah
macrocarpus endosperm were used by Coolbaugh et al. (1982) to show the
inhibition of ent-kaurene oxidation (a normal step in gibberellin
biosynthesis). They also found that growth in height of pea seedlings
was stopped by Ancymidol.<p>

In the present study, the effects of Ancymidol on the growth of
Arabidopsis were measured when applied in recommended concentrations
at various times in the life cycle as well as when applied in various
concentrations to plants all of the same age. In the latter case, the
effect of subsequent application of GA 3 solution to Ancymidol-treated
and untreated control plants also was noted.<p>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<p>

Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana race Landsberg erecta wild type were
sown on a nutrient medium composed of Hoagland's nutrient solution
made semi-solid with 0.75% agar (Fender and Schmid, 1981) and
contained in plastic petri dishes. All solutions were prepared using
demineralized, distilled water and no special procedures were employed
to obtain sterile cultures. When the seedlings were 4 days old, they
were transferred to 25 mm x 200 mm, cotton stoppered, glass culture
tubes containing 20 ml of the same nutrient medium. They were kept in
a controlled environment culture chamber at 25*degrees*C and in a
day/night regime of 16/8 hours. Light was provided with 4 Westinghouse
F40 cool-white fluorescent lamps and 4 100 watt incandescent lamps. A
regular times the height of the seedlings was measured and the
morphology of the seedlings was noted.<p>

In the first experiment, a group of plants was sprayed with a solution
of Ancymidol (100 ppm; the concentration recommended by the
manufacturer: Elanco Products, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA) when they
were 10 days of age. Furthr groups of plants were treated in the same
way at 16 and 25 days of age. An additional group was not sprayed.<p>

In order to insure that the plants were thoroughly sprayed with the
Ancymidol solution, a specially-designed atomizer was used to permit
application of the spray even to plants which were still quite short
and near the bottom of the culture tube. Such a sprayer was designed
and used by Benzinger (1983).<p>

In the second experiment, groups of plants were sprayed with various
concentrations of Ancymidol (25, 50, and 100 ppm) on the same day (14
days of age). Near the end of this experiment (23 days of age), half
of the plants in each treatment including the untreated controls were
sprayed with a GA 3 solution (10E-3 M). Final height data on these
plants were recorded 3 days later (26 days of age).<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

Data for the first experiment are presented in Figure 1. In the case
of the untreated control plants a normal growth curve was obtained.
The plants bolted at about 10 days of age and normal internodes and
flowers developed. By 20 days of age, siliques were forming and seeds
were developing. The leaves and flowers of these plants were
completely normal in appearance.<p>

When seedlings were sprayed with Ancymidol (100 ppm) at 10 days of
age, they still were quite short; the reason for using the
specially-designed atomizer as noted in Materials and Methods. As is
apparent from Figure 1, these plants stopped growing, their height
remaining essentially that of 10-day-old plants even when they were 31
days of age. With the passage of time, these plants produced the
expected number of internodes and leaves and even initiated flower
buds. Elongation of internodes did not occur; the leaves were
frequently malformed, although they remained green. The flowers also
were malformed although they seemed to retain all flower parts.
Extremely short, malformed siliques developed and viable seeds could
not be found within. By about 25 days of age several of these plants
had died; the remainder were deteriorating rapidly, with chlorosis
becoming a common situation.<p>

In their work with Easter lilies, Holmes et al. (1975) found that a
soil drench with Ancymidol retarded height growth and delayed
flowering although salable flowers were still formed. Coolbaugh et al.
(1982) treated 20-day-old pea seedlings with an Ancymidol drench and
found that further growth in height was stopped. Their experiment was
terminated at 40 days of age.<p>

These plants which were sprayed at 16 days of age displayed some
further increase in height although they had essentially stopped by 20
days of age. When 25-day-old plants were sprayed, little retardation
effect was observed.<p>

The concentration of Ancymiodol employed in this experiment was that
recommended by the manufacturer for commercial application.
Recommended used for Ancymidol (called A-Rest) include production of
shortened plants for the commercial florist trade.<p>

In the second experiment (Figure 2) the effects of reduced
concentrations of Ancymidol (25 and 50 ppm) were compared to those
with 100 ppm and untreated controls when applied to plants all of
which were 14 days of age. As in the case of the plants treated with
100 ppm Ancymidol in the first experiment (at 16 days of age) so also
here, the plants displayed some further increase in height through 26
days of age when the experiment was terminated.<p>

Lower concentrations of Ancymidol (25 and 50 ppm) had almost the same
effect; the degree of inhibition was not much less than that observed
with 100 ppm. Further experiments using concentrations of 10 ppm or so
might prove to be much less inhibitory. In their work with Easter
lily, Holmes et al. (1975) noted no significant difference in effect
of Ancymidol over an eight-fold variation in concentration.<p>

Coolbaugh et al. (1982) observed that treatment of pea seedlings with
GA 3 without Ancymidol, induced increased height growth. When
Ancymidol-treated pea seedlings were also treated with GA 3 (at the
same time), the inhibition of Ancymidol was partially reversed.<p>

In the present study, the plants used in the second experiment were
subjected to a comparable treatment. Having been treated with
Ancymidol at 14 days of age, half of the plants in each treatment, and
of the untreated controls, were sprayed with GA 3 solution (10E-3M)
when they were 23 days of age. Three days later their heights were
measured and compared to those of the plants not treated with GA 3.
Results of this test are presented in Table 1.<p>

From this set of data it is apparent that providing GA 3, even to
untreated controls, resulted in a slight increase in height; in the
Ancymidol-treated plants the inhibition was at least partially,
reversed while the untreated controls responded slightly. In contrast
to the study of Coolbaugh et al. (1982), in which plants were treated
with Ancymidol and GA 3 simultaneously, in the present study the
Ancymidol treatment preceded the GA 3 treatment by 9 days. Despite
this fact, the subsequent GA 3 spray did have some effect in reversing
the Ancymidol inhibition.<p>

Table 1: Effect of GA 3 (10E-3M) spray on height growth (+/- standard
deviation of the mean) of Arabidopsis with or without a prior spray of
Ancymidol. Ancymidol spray used at 14 days of age; GA 3 spray used at
23 days of age; data taken at 26 days of age.<p>

The antigibberellin effect of Ancymidol is believed to occur as a
result of interference with ent-kaurene oxidation enzymes which are
part of the biosynthetic pathway ultimately resulting in the
production of gibberellins. Coolbaugh et al. (1982) employed immature
endosperm of Marah macrocarpus to illustrate this inhibitory effect.
When plants such as those treated with Ancymidol in the present study
no longer are able to biosynthesize adquate amounts of gibberellin,
the failure of shot growth is apparent. It would seem that subsequent
provision of a gibberellin source in a spray treatment can be used to
alleviate the shortage of endogenous gibberellin and to permit the
plants to grow in height in a normal manner.<p>
