A postdoctoral position is available starting immediately in the lab of Christian Hardtke 
at the Dept. of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Lausanne, Switzerland. Our 
department offers excellent research infrastructure combined with a lively, interactive 
and international scientific community, located in the beautiful Lake Geneva region. 
 
The candidate is expected to build on recent progress in our lab on the molecular genetic 
analysis of BRX family proteins and their role in various aspects of growth and 
development in Arabidopsis and other species. 
 
Strongly motivated candidates with demonstrated expertise in molecular techniques are 
encouraged to apply. Funding for this position is secured up to mid-2010 and possibly 
beyond. Nevertheless, once joined the lab, the successful candidate is expected to apply 
for eligible fellowships. 
 
Please forward applications including a curriculum vitae and contact information for two 
senior scientist referees by e-mail to christian.hardtke@unil.ch.
