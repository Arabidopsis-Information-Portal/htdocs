Post-Doctoral Visiting Fellowship at AAFC – Ottawa
 
 
A position as a post-doctoral fellow is available at the Eastern Cereal and Oilseed 
Research Centre of Agriculture and AgriFood Canada in Ottawa.  The long term objective of 
the research is to develop novel crop fertility management systems.  The position is to undertake 
research on Arabidopsis pollen development.  The project will focus on a select group of pollen-
specific genes and will involve the characterization of the available Arabidopsis knockout mutants 
and the analysis of the sub-cellular targeting of the corresponding proteins within the pollen cell 
wall using fluorescent protein fusions in transgenic plants.
 
The ideal candidate will have extensive experience in molecular and cell biology.  A 
background in transgenic plant analysis and protein biochemistry would be valuable.  The 
candidate must have a successful track record and clear evidence of the ability to perform 
high quality research with considerable independence. The position is available for two 
years beginning April 1, 2009.  The candidate must meet the requirements for an 
NSERC Visiting Fellowship and will be paid according to the prescribed rates 
(http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/PD-NP/Laboratories-
Laboratoires/index_eng.asp).
Interested applicants should send a curriculum vitae and contact details for two referees 
by e-mail to Laurian.robert@agr.gc.ca.
