Detailed action spectra for photoinduction and photoinactivation of
the seed germination of Arabidopsis thaliana, race "Estland", were
firstly presented by Shropshire et al., (1961). The close similarity
of the spectra with other photomorphogenetic action spectra in diverse
plant species indicated that it conformed to the well known
red/far-red response mediated by phytochrome. Later studies of our
group have shown that some photomorphogenic responses including seed
germination mediated by the red/far-red sensitive photoreceptor were
variant to certain degrees in different genotypes of this species
(Hehl and Kranz, 1971; Diekmann and Kranz, 1973; Krana, 1974a; Ritzel,
1977). By spectrophotometric measurement we presented additional
information showing that the transformation of the photoreceptor was
evidently defective in some of the genotypes studied (Kranz, 1974b,
1975, 1976, 1977). Recently Koornneef et al. (980) and Spruit et al.
(1980) were able to demonstrate spectrophotometrically detectable
phytochrome contents of the hypocotyl tissue ranging from nearly zero
to normal quantities in a series of hy-mutants. In order to prove the
putative photosensor defects of phytochrome and accessory pigments,
detailed action spectra for the germination responses are necessary.<p>

Seeds of the lines +-/+- (wild type En-2), ch2/ch2 (mutant,
chlorophyll b deficient), and im52/im52 (mutant, green-white
variegated) were harvested from plants grown under long day conditions
(16L/8D hrs.) of natural light supplemented with fluorescent light
(>10Klx) in a glasshouse (20-25*degrees*C). After at least one month
of storing from harvest time at deep temperature of -20*degrees*C they
were placed aseptically at equal distances on the agar medium of Redei
(1965) plus 1 x 10 E-6M IAA and caseinhydrolysate (lg per liter) in
plastic dishes () 5cm). Imbibition and vernalization (at 3*degrees*C)
were carried out in light-light containers for 24 to 48 hours. The
dishes were then transferred under green dim light to cabinets for
far-red (15 min.) resp. red (15 to 30 min) irradiation where the light
was passing through broad band filters with *lambda*max = 730 nm
rsp. 660 nm (15 and 30 J m2 for ch2/ch2 and +/+, im52/im52 rsp.);
immediately they were brought to a monochromatic light cabinet and
there irradiated through 11 interference filters (Schott, Balzer) with
10 m micro band width from 346 to 746 nm (2,500 microJ).<p>

Light source was a halide ellipsoid reflector lamp (Schott KL 150W)
with heat absorption filter (Schott KG1) and cooling by blower. Dose
responses were estimated from the curves for induction and
inactivation of seed germination presented by Shropshire et al.
Imbibition of the Arabidopsis seeds in KNO 3-solution (10E-3M)
effected only an insignificant increase of germination. Temperture was
regulated in the dishes at 28*degrees*C by means of strong
ventilation. The effectiveness of the irradition system was previously
tested by B. Reinahrdt with seeds of Lactuca sativa c.v. "Grand
Rapids". After this procedure of photoactivation and inactivation resp
the dishes were placed back to the light-tight containers and kept for
5 days at 25*degrees*C. Germination of the seeds was counted and the
action spectra calculated for the period 48 to 106 hours. after the
last light treatment indicated. The spectra and quantum responsibility
for the induction response (R1) and the inactivation (Rp) were
computed by the formulas of Shropshire et al. (1961).<p>

Figure 1: Action spectra for photoinduction (a) and photoinactivation
(b) of seed germination in wild type (+/+) and its mutant genotypes
(ch2/ch2, im52/im52) of Arabidopsis thaliana.<p>

Points represent the means of four repetitions (dishes) of two
independent experiments. Ri and Rp resemble the quotient of the number
of seeds germinated or non-germinated through the number of incident
quanta. The curves were normalized to 100% at sensitivity for *lambda* =658
and 724 nm rsp.<p>

The results so far obtained show evidently large differences between
the spectra for photoactivation as well as for inactivation of the
genotypes studied (Figure 1). This holds true for longer (&gt;660 nm) as
well as shorter (<500 nm) wavelengths. Quantitative differences of the
light effects of the red/far-red part of the spectrum show good
correspondence with partial deficiencies of the phytochrome
transformation (in red light) of Pr to Pfr in +-/+- (Kranz, 1975,
1976, 1977); note the shift of peak sensitivity to 620 nm in Figure
1a. Qualitative differences of the spectra in the blue light region
between ch2/ch2 and the other genotypes may belong to variable
accessory pigment defects of the "cryptochrome" (cf. Gressel,
1979). The variant height of the photoactivation and inactivation
maxima results from variable dose responsivity of the genotypes which
has been obtained in previous experiments where the relative amount of
Pfr in etiolated seedlings (Kranz, 1977; c.f. Table 1) as well as the
seed germination of +-/+- an im52/im52 proved to be much more
insensitive to light than the germination of ch2/ch2 (c.f. also Spruit
et al., 1980)<p>

Presently our conclusion from the data indicated is that the
genotypically controlled deficiencies of the light mediated seeds
germination in Arabidopsis assign to the type and status of the
photosensor(s) as well as its (their) transformation capacity. Further
experiments are necessary to separate quantitatively the part of each
factor of photoreception and its genic basis.<p>
