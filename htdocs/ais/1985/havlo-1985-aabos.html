The genoclinal distribution of summer-annual (early flowering) and
winter-annual (late flowering) genotypes in the Moravian natural
population of A. thaliana with predominating winter annuals in warm
and dry lowlands and summer annuals in cold and wet highlands (Cetl et
al., 1969; Cetl, 1976) could be explained as a result of adaptation
caused by natural selection against opposite genotypes in the course
of colonization (Cetl, 1978a, 1980). Thus, the distribution pattern
seems to be non random due to natural selection, although random
processes (the dispersive process) may also play a certain role (Cetl,
1978a).<p>

An opportunity of studying the relative role of nonrandom and random
processes forming the distribution of early and late flowering
genotypes in natural populations have emerged in the last years when
the internal differentiation in the genetic system of flowering time
was studied in several large and isolated natural populations
occupying areas rather of hundreds than of tens of m 2. It was
possible to conduct transects along the axes of these areas and to
search for the differences in the flowering time indexes in the course
of transects (Cetl, 1978b; Perinova and Cetl, 1983).<p>

The percent of early flowering was low in the lowest and highest
positions and high in the intermediate ones when the transects were
conducted along the inclination lines. The distribution pattern was
regarded non-random due to the differentiation of microrelief,
microclimate, and accompanying plant species in the vertical direction
(Cetl, 1978b). Obviously the process of adaptation through natural
selection was so decisive in this differentiated environment that the
consequences of random processes were difficult to follow.<p>

For this reason, Perinova and Cetl (1983) worked with transects from
environmentally more homogenous biotopes. They tested two independent
hypotheses: (1) on the homogeneity, (2) on the nondirectionality of
the distribution of flowering time indexes along the transects.
Generally, homogeneity and nondirectionaltiy of distributions would
only appear under the absence of both dispersive and systematic
processes. Nonhomogenous and nondirectional distributions would
testify for the presence of dispersive process alone including,
respectively, the founder effect. Under non-homogeneity and
directionality, not only the random processes but also the effect of
nonrandom (systematic) processes acting along the transect would be
recognized. Nonhomogeneity was found in all three populations studied
(Bs, Da, Jm) while in one of them (Da) the directional distribution
along the transect conducted in the NW-SE direction was found, similar
to the whole Moravian A. thaliana population.<p>

In the present experiments, the two hypotheses were tested in the
samples of the natural population Sn collected in June, 1984 near
Senorady 12 km W from Ivancice at 360 m above sea-level. The transect
was conducted along the axis of the grassland biotope in the N-S
direction. The samples were taken in regular distances of 4 meters.
Each sample contained 25 mature plants whose seeds were mixed. In
total, 14 samples (Sn-1 to Sn-14) were obtained. At the same time,
samples from the steppe biotope Babi hora 4 km N from Dolni Kounice at
about 340 m above sea level were collected for comparison in three
independent, spatially well isolated populations (Bh-1 to Bh-3) along
with the sample of one solitary plant in the marginal teritory (Bh-4).<p>

Approximately 100 plants per sample were studied at 25 +/- 3*degrees*C
and continuous illumination 1250 lux. Each sample was determined by
(1) the percent of generative plants up to 28 days from emergence, g
28, (2) the mean number of days to the appearance of flower primordia,
x, with the standard error, (3) the mean number of rosette leaves, y,
with the standard error. The null hypothesis on the homogeneity of the
distribution along the transect was tested by comparing the F(k-1,N-k)
variance ratio, where k is the number of samples and N the total
number of all plants in all samples, with that given for *alpha*=.05.
The null hypothesis on the nondirectionality was tested by means of
the regression of the sample means on the distance, d (meters) from
the beginning of the transect. The statistical significance of the
observed regression coefficient, by, was tested by meant of t (12) for
*alpha* = .05.<p>

According to Cetl, Dobrovolna and Effermtova (1969), all samples of
the Sn population could be classified as summer annual. The x and y
values in particular samples were quite different and their course
over the transect appeared erratic (Figure 1, left). As expected, the
x and y were mutually correlated (r+/-s = .7092+/-.2035; t 12 = 4.91
t> 05(12) = 2.18). For this reason, the two hypotheses were tested
using only the number of days to the appearance of flower primordia,
x.<p>

The null hypothesis on the homogeneity of the distribution of x values
in the transect could be rejected as F (13, 1098) = 65.14 > F.05(13,
1098)= 2.22. The null hypothesis on the nondirectionality could be
accepted as b y =/-sb y = .045.101, and t (12) = .45 <t 05(12) = 2.18.
It could be concluded that the distributions of early and late
flowering genotypes was due to the dispersive process and no proof of
the effect of systematic processes acting along the transect was done.<p>

Figure 1: The percent of generative plants, g 28 (uppermost), the mean
number of days to the appearance of flower primordia, x, the mean
number of rosette leaves, y, (middle), and the topographical situation
(bottom) along the transect of the population from Senorady (Sn, left)
and in independent populations from Babi hora (Bh, right).<p>

On the other hand, however, the course of changes of x (and also of y)
in Figure 1 (left) was not so erratic as would appear at first sight.
The lowest values of x testifying for very early flowering, 10.8 to
13.4 days, were found between the 24th and the 48th meter of the
transect. Other x's were higher: 13.5 to 156 days in the northern part
and 15.6 days in the southern end of the transect. It could be,
therefore, not excluded that some special microenvironmental situation
could lead to this prevalence of very early flowering genotypes in the
part of the transect between 24th and 48th meter.<p>

As yet, natural selection against early flowering, summer annual
genotypes in the warm and dry lowlands with long autumnal period of
vegetation was supposed to be the main selective mechanism maintaining
the clinal distribution of early and late flowering genotypes in
Moravia (Cetl, 1978a). However, the effectivity of this mechanism is
causing certain adaptive differences of flowering time within a narrow
range of several tens of meters seems to be improbable. Paponova
(1977) suggested the existence of another mechanism which might be
effective also in short distances, namely, that winter annuals have a
selection advantage at higher soil moisture.<p>

According to a scheme of the relief of the Sn biotope (Figure 1, left,
bottom), there was a relatively sheer slope just between 24th and 48th
meter of the transect. Its exposition was to S. Even if no
measurements of soil moisture were available we could observe that the
vegetation cover was lower and of lesser density when compared in the
beginning and at the end of the transect.<p>

Actually, this leads us to suppose that constant or periodical
differences in soil moisture might be effective in causing certain
differences in the distribution of early and late flowering genotypes
even in short distances. Then the low x and y values in the segment of
our transect between 24th and 48th meter might be an example of
adaptive changes by natural selection favouring early flowering
genotypes when soil moisture is low. It is to add that genotypes
showing flower primordia 15 and more days after emergence, when grown
at 25*degrees*C and under continuous illumination, still carry a low
vernalization requirement (Cetl, 1978a).<p>

Thus nonhomogenous and nondirectional distributions of early and late
flowering genotypes along the transects do not testify equivocally for
the presence of random effects alone. These distributions can follow
from a joint effect of dispersive process and natural selction if the
transect is conducted over a microenvironmental mosaic connected with
selectively acting differences.<p>

The internal differentiation in the gentic system of flowering time in
the natural population from Senorady was not very profound compared
with the differences between the independent, spatially isolated
populations from Babi hora. The population Bh-3 appeared as
winter-annual, Bh-2 mixed, and Bh-1, along with the progeny of the
Bh-4 plant, summer annual. Also the x and y values of the generative
plant fraction of particular Bh populations differed considerably
(Figure 1, right). A simple comparison of the differences between the
particular members of the transect from Senorady on one hand and the
particular independent populations from Babi hora on the other was, of
course, difficult owing to a higher proportion of late, winter-annual
genotypes in the latter part of the material studied. Nevertheless,
spatial isolation preventing migration in the distance of several
hundreds of meters (Figure 1, right, bottom) may contribute to greater
differences in the flowering time indexes than may arise in the
distance of several tens of meters in a continuous population of A.
thaliana whose migration activity is high (Perinova and Cetl, 1983).<p>
