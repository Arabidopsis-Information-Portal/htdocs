AIS Vol 02:<h2>Epidemic appearance of Alternaria brassicae on Arabidopsis growing in green houses</h2><p>

Green-house cultures of Arabidopsis thaliana and some related species
(A. suecica, A. arenosa) can be destroyed completely by Alternaria
brassicae.  Older leaves lying near the soil are usually the first to
be affected. The symptoms are yellowish-brown spots which later fuse.
The leaves then become brown and dry.  The infection spreads to
younger leaves and follows up to stem. Such heavily affected plants
are unable to survive.  It often happens, that the stamens dry up even
in the closed buds and so do the developing seeds.  The characteristic
conidia and the septate and branched mycelium could be observed under
the microscope on both sides of the infected leaves.<p>

A.  brassicae is of common occurrence and a very injurious fungus on
Cruciferae.  It belongs to the order Moniliales (family Dematiaceae)
of Fungi imperfecti.  The parasite is transmitted as mycelium or as
conidia hibernating in soil, infected plant debris and also on seeds.
Humid and warm conditions favour the transmission of the fungus.
Chemical methods of controlling the infection are rarely practiced.
Some success seems to be attained with spraying the accustomed Cu -
preparates or zinc carbamates ("Fuclasin Ultra"-SCHERING).  In any
case it is necessary to work with sterilized (steamed) soil.<p>
