INTRODUCTION<p>

Among the great variety of mutagen-induced forms with inheritent
variations in plants, the allelic mutations are of particular
interest. The determination of a series of multiple alleles for one
locus reveals the true genic nature of the arising mutations.
Presently it is well known, that allelic mutations differently block
the same links in the chain of biological reactions, that is why they
may serve as convenient models for studying the genic fine structure
and the mechanisms of its action on phenotypic characters.<p>

Having at hand a great collection of chlorophyll mutants of
Arabidopsis thaliana, we set ourselves the task to elucidate the
allelic interrelations in 8 yellow-green mutants of the chlorina type.<p>

MATERIAL AND METHODS<p>

The object for the study, vital chlorophyll mutants of Arabidopsis
thaliana, were induced by various physical agents and chemical
substances. The brief phenotypic characteristics of the mutants are as
follows:<p>

The experimental plants were grown in soil at the Alpine Station of
Sya-Kukh. During the growth and development of the plants phenologic
observations were carried out, the variability of several quantitative
characters was registered (Table 1). When the plants reached
budding-flowering stages crosses were made according to the general
adopted methods (Usmanov and Muller, (1970).<p>

It is known that the determination of the series of multiple alleles
requires to carry out the great bulk of work of crossing all the
mutants with each other. For calculating the maximum number of allelic
crosses the following formula is suggested<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol20/vol20-pg37-fig0.gif">Click here for figure</a><p>

where M is the number of crosses, n is the number of mutant lines to
be crossed (Batalov and Kvitko, 1971). This work is recommended to be
carried out stage by stage, including not more than 4-5 lines into the
genetic analysis simultaneously. In our experiments about 200 crosses
were carried out.<p>

For establishing the allelic interrelations, the functional criterium
(test for allelism) based on the fact that at crossing 2 mutants
carrying changes in different genes a F 1- hybrid arises, i.e., a
diheterozygote having the wild phenote due to the dominance of
wildtype alleles of each gene. In such cases it is accepted that the
recessive mutations used are complement to each other, i.e.,
nonallelic. If, however, the crossed mutants carry allelic mutants, in
the hybrid the wildtype is not revealed, since both alleles of one and
the same gene located in homologous chromosomes carry the mutational
changes, i.e., these mutations are not complementary, so-called
allelic (Fincham, 1968; Gershkovich, 1983).<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

The majority of our mutants have the character of point mutations,
side by side with the main mutant character (yellow green colour of
leaves) they differ both from each other and in comparison with the
control by additional quantitative characters (Table 1). These
experimental data reveal the pleiotropic character of action of
mutations controlling the trait of the chlrorophyll deficiency.<p>

yellow-green mutants and their original form En of Arabidopsis
thaliana.<p>

Crossing the yellow-green mutants with each other three loci (73,
58/15, 568/5) were identified controlling independently similar
phenotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana (yellow green colour) (Figure 1).<p>

Figure 1: Qualitative characteristic of the results of diallelic
crosses of yellow-green mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana in F 1
hybrids.<p>

At one locus (58/15) six allelomorphic conditions of one and the same
gene re were identified, i.e., crossing the mutants (58/15, V-76,
6.2(14), 12.5.(17), 12.6(15) and F 6 Chl) with each other F
1-generation showed mutant colour. Since mutant 58/15 and V-76 belong
to chromosomal linkage group 3, we conclude that allelic mutations can
also be classified to the same linkage group.<p>

Summarizing the results of this study we come to the following
conclusion. Similar changes in the development of phenotypic character
(yellow-green colour of plants) may be determined both by various
mutations of different genes and by various mutations in different
subunits of one and the same gene. At present we carry out experiments
to elucidate "dominant-recessive" interrelations in a group of
phenotypically similar allelic mutations.<p>
