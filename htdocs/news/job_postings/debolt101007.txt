POSTDOCTORAL POSITION: 

Physiology, chemical genetic, biochemical, and cell biological studies 
of the plant cell wall synthesis

A postdoctoral position is available as of Jan 1st 2008, to study the 
cellulose biosynthetic machinery, its activation, regulation and how it 
can be modified to increase the efficiency of cellulosic biomass 
conversion. Live cell imaging of cellulose synthase will be employed in 
combination with chemical genetics to dissect cellulose synthesis. The 
position is for one year with the possibility of continuing for a 
second year etc. Stipend will be commensurate with experience. The 
successful candidate should have biochemical skills and some 
knowledge/experience with molecular biology/genetics as well as a 
background in plant biology including some knowledge of Arabidopsis. 
Collaborative skills are also essential.

Please send a cover letter outlining your research interests and career 
goals, current curriculum vitae plus publication list, and the names 
and email addresses of three references familiar with your recent 
research to:
