The second nitrate reductase-less mutant mentioned in our previous
report (OOSTINDIER-BRAAKSMA and FEENSTRA 1973 a), which we will denote
by its isolation number B25 until more definite data about its
localization are obtained, appears to be different from the
chl-2/chl-2 type isolated earlier (VAN DER LAAN et al. 1971;
OOSTINDIER-BRAAKSMA and FEENSTRA 1973 b).  Whereas the chl-2 type
exhibits some nitrate reductase activity when grown on a medium with
nitrate, though at a lower level than the wildtype, B25 has no enzyme
activity at all; decrease in growth on a medium with nitrate as the
only nitrogen source and chlorate resistance of B25 are more extreme
as compared to chl-2.<p>

In complementation tests B25 and the chlorate-resistant mutants of the
chl-1 type and the chl-2 type B25 showed complementation with both
other mutants indicating that the mutation in B25 probably effects a
new gene.<p>

Preliminary linkage studies showed that the mutated gene in B25 is
probably linked with chl-2, though not so closely as might be expected
with two genes in operon.  Linkage experiments with marker lines are
presently also being pursued.<p>

Young B25 plants appear to grow rather poorly when cultivated under
continuous illumination of about 10.000 lux (condition used previously
for the isolation of mutants).  Much better growth is obtained when
the mutant is grown till shooting under lowered light intensity and a
daily light period of 16 hours.<p>

When the conditions for growing selected chlorate-resistant M2 plants
to maturity were changed accordingly, several more mutants showing a
lowered level of nitrate reductase activity were isolated.  Presently
experiments are being carried out to establish whether still other
genes are involved besides those found previously.<p>
