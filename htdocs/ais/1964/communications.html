Induced quantitative variation in Arabidopsis thaliana.  A number of
mutagenic treatments (gamma rays, thermal neutrons, EMS, 2 Cl-EMS,
DES, nitrous acid and nebularine) are being compared for their
efficiency in inducing mutations, affecting quantitatively inherited
characters (growth rate and flowering time).  These studies are also
aimed at confirming and extending the general hypothesis developed
with other species, viz. that the response of any quantitatively
inherited character to random mutation is an increase in the variance
and a shift of the mean away from the direction of previous selection.<p>

Radiation sensitivity of Arabidopsis races.  Differences in
sensitivity to gamma radiation have been detected among races of
Arabidopsis thaliana.  An investigation of the genetic basis of the
sensitivity differences is in progress.<p>

Chemical mutagenesis.  In pursuit to the mutation experiments reported
on page 18 we are studying the effect of some chemomutagens (mainly of
the urea group) in combination with metabolic inhibitors (DNP, NaN3)
as well as the action of their decomposition products.<p>

Biochemical mutants.  The studies referring to this topic are
concerned with artificial nutrition, identification and possibility of
normalisation of nutritionally deficient mutants from the group of
chlorophyll lethals.  The genetic relations between mutants of this
group are being studied by hybridisation of heterozygotes (cf. p. 21)

Vol 01:<h2>A. J. MULLER</h2><h2>Communication from Gatersleben</h2>

Comparative investigations on the efficiency, biological effects and
mode of action of various mutagens have been conducted.  The
mutagenic activity is measured mainly by the frequency of recessive
lethals (embryonic lethals and chlorophyll mutations).  In this
connection genetical investigations with lethal factors, studies on
the chimerical structure of M1-plants and on the diplontic selection
are carried out.  Using X-rays the effects of moisture, storage, and
oxygen post-treatment on the mutation frequency were studied.
Experiments were performed to determine the radiosensitivity at
several stages of development (including developing embryos).  In
studies with chemical mutagens the following compounds have
successfully been used so far: EMS, HN 2, HN 3, myleran,
1-methyl-3-nitro-1-nitrosoguanindine, and methylnitrosourea.  After
treatment with NaNO2, nebularine, JUdR, BUdR, amethopterine,
hydroxylamin and streptomycin no significant increase in the lethal
mutation frequency was observed.  In addition to other methodological
investigations some questions on the physiology of germination were
studied.<p>

Influence of genotype on mutagen induced variation for quantitative
characters.  The different races of Arabidopsis thaliana are the
product of natural selection over a long period and differ widely in
their genotypes, especially with respect to flowering.  Days to flower
is a quantitative character, comparatively easy to score and under
controlled conditions the environmental variation is very small.  It
is planned to use single plant seed samples of a number of races,
differing appreciably in days to flower, under the same photoperiodic
and other physiological conditions.  Following treatment with EMS and
X- rays, only normal looking plants in M2 and M3 generation will be
scored for flowering, thus eliminating all chlorophyll and
morphological mutants.  Statistical parameters of each population will
be estimated.  Extreme plants on + and - side of the mean will be
selected to extract lines on both sides of the mean.  - Aim of the
experiment is to illicit information if the phenotypic release of
genetic variability for quantitative characters, following treatment
with mutagens, is more in one direction, and if so, whether the "easy
direction" is correlated with the genotype of the parent material.<p>

The studies underway are the following:<p>

Physiological genetic studies on nutritional mutants.  Further
attempts are being made to locate more precisely the genetic blocks of
thiamin synthesis in the thiazole and pyrimidine requiring mutants
available.  Linkage inforamation is being sought.<p>

Physiological investigations on the functional anomalies of a gene
causing somatic variegation.  Previous studies demonstated that the
two extreme phenotypes of mutant im are not due to mutation of the
gene but rather to an alteration of its function.  It appears that the
change is mediated through an independent regulatory element.
Chemical and physical factors affecting the change and the possibility
of a complete removal of that element is being investigated.<p>

Analysis of gametophyte factors.  Genetic damage of the chromosomes
generally result in poor male transmission and provides means for
estimating the extent of the defects if used with multiple markers.  A
female gametophyte factor is being investigated aiming to detect
megaspore competition and to study the possibility of half tetrad
analysis.<p>

Somatic recombination.  Marker exchange at the four strand stage has
been demonstrated in our laboratory.  Investigations are underway to
estimate the frequency and the basic mechanism of the event.<p>

Studies on gene structure.  Multiple allelic loci have been detected
in Arabidopsis and with appropriately marked chromosomes intragenic
recombination is being studied at two loci.<p>

Mutational mechanism.  Genetic analysis of chromosome fine structure,
"multiple strandedness" is being attempted by using base analogue
mutagens.<p>

Genetic and physiological studies on chlorophyll b deficient mutants.
Multiple alleles at the ch locus are under study to explore eventual
allelic complementation. Role of chlorophyll b in photosynthesis will
be investigated with special regard to H+ donors in
photophosphorylation.<p>

Map construction.  Continuous efforts are being made to develop
Arabidopsis into a more useful genetic tool.  New mutants are studied
for linkage.  Trisomics are also adopted to facilitate this effort.<p>

Trisomics.  Continuation of the study and characterization of
trisomics with the possible development of secondary trisomes.<p>

Chromosomal aberrations.  Analysis of chromosomal aberrations in
genetically suspect lines.  Two translocations have been found in one
line.<p>

"When in The Hague you proposed the Newsletter idea it was unanimously
welcome, but there was no request about the cost of production.  I
believe we all could contribute a little from our research funds if
this would be needed, or perhaps we could get a special fund if this
will be necessary."

Comment of the editor: You will be interested in knowing that the
expense incurred in connection with assembling, mimeographing and
mailing of this issue amounts in the order of DM 350,-, viz. DM 2.50
each.  No prospect of any fund for financing the next issue is at
present held out to the editor.  Thus donations paid to the account of
"Arabidopsis Information Service", Konto-No. 2069 at Stadtische
Sparkasse, Hauptstelle, Gottingen, will as well be appeciated as
suggestions for future financial sources.<p>

Vol 01:<h2>A.J. MULLER</h2><h2>Communication from Gatersleben</h2>

Proposals for a nomenclature of mutants and genes in Arabidopsis

1.  Principally the recommendations of the "International Committee on
Genetic Symbols and Nomenclature" (Un. Int. Sci. Biol. Ser.  B. 30,
1-6, 1957) should be applied.<p>

2.  To avoid that the same denotation or symbol will be used for
different mutants, a list of mutants and genes should be prepared.  An
Arabidopsis worker should be delegated to permanently conduct this
register.  Everyone intending to publish a new denotation or symbol
need send his proposals to the mentioned person.  He receives
immediately an information, whether or not the proposed symbols or
denotations have already been disposed. The date of receipt will
decide the priority.<p>

3.  To incrase the value of mutant nomenclature and to avoid confusion
through duplicated denotation it might be desired that a definite
nomenclature scheme has to be followed, especially with regard to
characters with a high phenotypic and genotypic variability.  Such a
nomenclature pattern has already been proposed by MULLER (1963) for
lethal mutations and by LAMPRECHT (Agri Hort. Genetica 18, 135-168,
1960; cf. BLIXT: ibid 19, 402-447, 1961) for sublethal and viable
chlorophyll mutants.  For instance each mutation causing yellow
cotyleadons should be named as xantha.  Any newly arisen mutation
might be differentiated by denoting as xa1, xa2, and so on.  Other
existing mutants, for example, the yellow-green variants are not to be
termed xantha.<p>

4.  If crossing results prove two similar phenotypes to be allelic in
nature, the symbols will acquire the same suffic but different
exponents.  For instance, if xa1 and xa5 are shown to be allelic they
get the new denotation xa1 and xa1.  Two independently arisen mutants
should only be claimed identical after having been proved allelic in
proper crossing experiments.<p>

5.  Mutants which are no longer available for comparison should be
removed from the list.  The denotations and symbols thus falling
vacant could again be used only for phenotypes similar to the earlier
mutant.  Arabidopsis Information Service will publish a complete list
of existing mutants including the original reference and the addresses
of the respective seed supplying station.  If a worker is unable to
maintain his stocks on announcement in Arabidopsis Information Service
another working team should undertake this responsibility.<p>

6.  New denotation of mutants and symbols should not be introduced if
these are not intended to be conserved for further experiments.  In
this case a simple numbering should be preferred.<p>

7.  Arabidopsis Information Service will periodically publish a
complete review on those genes that either could be ascribed to a
linkage group or for which crossing-over data have been worked out.<p>
