Postdoctoral position in ethylene signaling / proteomics

A postdoctoral position is available in the laboratory of Dr. Caren Chang for a highly motivated 
and capable postdoctoral researcher to investigate protein networks in ethylene signaling using 
proteomics, reverse genetics, functional studies, and protein-protein interaction assays in 
Arabidopsis. Projects include examining protein targets of ethylene signaling, studying protein-
protein interactions and analyzing ethylene receptor regulation. The appointment is for at least 
three years, starting this summer or early fall (a later start date is negotiable). 

Applicants must have a Ph.D. in biological sciences with a publication record/solid training in 
molecular genetics, cell biology, proteomics or biochemistry, and must have excellent communication 
skills. Experience with plants is not required, but experience working in a genetic model system is 
preferred. The position offers the opportunity to develop expertise in proteomics and plant 
molecular genetics. Mass spectrometry/proteomic analysis will be carried out in collaboration with 
researchers at USDA-ARS located five minutes from the campus. The Chang lab (Department of Cell 
Biology and Molecular Genetics) is housed in a new building with state-of-the-art facilities and 
enjoys an interactive research environment. The University of Maryland, College Park, is located in 
the Washington DC metropolitan area, which has tremendous cultural and geographic diversity, a rich 
history, and an array of residential environments, natural areas, and recreational activities.

Please submit 1) a curriculum vitae, 2) a cover letter outlining research interests, qualifications 
and reasons for applying, and 3) the names of three references by email to Dr. Caren Chang 
(carenc@umd.edu), preferably in a single pdf attachment.
