Three species of the genus Arabidopsis were studeid cytologically: A.
korshinskyi BOTSCH., obtained by the courtesy of S. YUNUSOV from the
Botanical Institute in Dushanbe, A. griffithiana (BOISS.) BUSCH (A.
pumila (STEPH.) BUSCH ?),  and A. wallichii (J.D. HOOK.) both obtained
by th courtesy of E.YA. RAZHIVINA from the Botanical Institute in
Leningrad.  Standard squash preparation technique was applied.<p>

In all the species mitosis was studied in shoot tip cells and in young
sepals.  In some cases mitosis was also studied in leaf meristematic
cells (A. korshinskyi) and in root tip cells (A. griffithiana).
Besides, meiotic preparations of pollen mother cells and tetrads in A.
korshinskyi and A. griffithiana were also examined.  The following
chromosome numbers were found:
<pre>
A. wallichii      2n = 16
A. griffithiana   2n = 32
A. korshinskyi    2n = 48.</pre><p>

It is to be mentioned, however, that in some of the examined cells the
chromosome numbers deviated form the above given ones by +/- 2.<p>
