<h2>The influence of pH on the mutagenic activity of nitroso-compounds on Arabidopsis</h2><p>

The release of diazoalkanes is a condition for the activity of
nitrosoamides and nitrosoamines.  In the case of nitrosoamides, e.g.,
N-ethyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (ENG) and N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea
(ENH) the release of diazoalkanes is a result of a hydrolytic
decomposition. Diazoalkanes are, however, very labile and if the
decomposition takes place outside the seeds, they do not probably
reach the mutable sites in the meristematic cells. The rate of
hydrolysis depends on the temperature and on the pH of the solution.
At pH 3 to pH 6 it is relatively slow, but at pH 7 and in alkaline
solutions it steeply increases. For ENH at pH 7 the half-life is about
1.5 hr (see DRUCKREY et al., 1967) and as a consequence only a small
amount of unhydrolyzed nitrosoamides is taken up in the seeds during
the 24 hrs treatment. This can perhaps explain, why ENH and ENG are
very active at pH 3 to pH 6 and why their activity is lowered at pH 7.
Nitrosoamines, e.g., methylbenzylnitrosoamine (MBNA) and
ethylvinyulnitrosoamine (EVNA) are very stabile, even in alkaline
solutions. Their decomposition takes only place in the seeds after the
action of specific enzymes. They are mutagenic, therefore regardless
of the pH of the mutagenic solution, at least in the range of the
pH-solutions tested.<p>
