Regardless of their mutagenic ability, dialkylnitrosamines inhibit the
germination of Arabidopsis seeds in a dose dependent relation
(VELEMINSKY and GICHNER, 1971).  The ratio between this biological
damage and the concentration of the dialkylnitrosamines can be applied
as a measure of their toxicity.  When a logarithm of the concentration
of the dialkylnitrosamines (in mM), inducing 50% inhibition of seed
germination in a 24 hr treatment at 25*degrees*C, was plotted against
the number of C-atoms, a straight line could be drawn for saturated
non-branched derivatives, i.e. dimethyl-(2C), ethylmethyl-(3C),
diethyl-(4C), n-butylmethyl-(5C) and amylmethylnitrosamines (6C) (cf.
in the Figure).  With the increasing number of C-atoms, the
concentration needed to induce the same germination inhibition
decreases, i.e., the toxicity of the compounds increases.<p>

Figure: The relation of concentration (mM) inducing 50% inhibition of
seed germination (CG50) to the number of C-atoms in the alkylgroups of
saturated nonbranched dialkylnitrosamines. The points represent mean
values established in several independent experiments.<p>

DRUCKREY et al. (1967) established for the same dialkylnitrosamines a
linear relationship of the number of C-atoms to the log. of their
distribution coefficients (hexan/buffer) and to the log. of their
solubility in water (g/100 ml).  With the increasing number of C-atoms
the distribution coefficient (lipophilic character) increased and the
solubility in water decreases. These findings could perhaps explain
the relation of the toxicity of dialkylnitrosamines to the number of
C-atoms in their molecules. Especially the relation of toxicity to the
lipophilic character can be of biological importance, since the
lipophility influences the penetration of agents through membranes and
their intracellular compartmentation into various structures (cf.
SCHWAIER et al., 1966)<p>

In contrast to the toxicity, no clear relation of the number of
C-atoms to the mutagenic effectiveness (i.e., frequency of
mutations/concentration of mutagen) of mutagenic dimethyl-, ethyl-,
methyl-, n-butylmethyl- and amylemethylnitrosamines could be
demonstrated. This supports the conclusion based on other facts
(VELEMINSKY and GICHNER, 1971) that the toxic action of nitrosamines
and their mutagenic ability are governed by two, more or less
independent mechanisms.<p>
