Bioinformatics postdoc position to study protein-protein interactions in Arabidopsis

A bioinformatics postdoctoral position is available immediately in the laboratory of Dr. Sue Rhee at the Carnegie 
Institution, Department of Plant Biology (Stanford, CA), to participate in generating the first genome-wide membrane 
protein-protein interaction maps in Arabidopsis. To understand the regulation of cell-environment, cell-cell, and 
intracellular compartment to cytosol interactions better, a consortium of six laboratories plan to determine the 
interactions of 6,400 proteins from the reference plant Arabidopsis. This set comprises essentially all integral 
membrane proteins and a large number (>1,000) of proteins predicted to be involved in signaling or protein modification. 
More information about the project can be found at http://associomics.org/.

The successful candidate will be responsible for carrying out bioinformatic analyses to select genes for initial 
interactions and subsequent experimental validation, to determine statistically significant interactions, to make the 
data easily accessible to researchers, and to create and analyze the interaction network maps. S/he will work with 
postdocs and other scientists in molecular, cell and theoretical biology labs.

Qualified candidates must have a Ph.D. or equivalent in Biology, Mathematics, Computer Science, Engineering or related 
field, a strong background in using statistics, some background in modeling and programming, and strong communication 
skills.

Please email a brief letter describing your research experience, plus your CV and contact information for 3 references 
to Dr. Sue Rhee at rhee@acoma.stanford.edu.
