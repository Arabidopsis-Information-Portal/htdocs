<h2>Effect of ozone on Arabidopsis</h2><p>

Little is known about the mutagenic activity of ozone. DAVIS (1961)
found increases in mutation frequencies of streptomycin dependence to
nondependence and of phage susceptibility to resistance in E. coli
following ozone treatment as well as decreasing survival of the
colonies.  In 1971, ZELAC, CROMROY, BOLCH, DUNAVANT and BEVIS found
chromosome breakage in lymphocyte cells of Chinese hamsters exposed to
0.2 ppm ozone for 5 hours.  Chromosome bridges and fragments as
anaphase were noted by FETNER (1958) in the roottips of Vicia faba
following ozone fumigation of seed.<p>

Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana L. were sown in a soil: peat: perlite
(1:2:1) mix in a growth chamber at a light intensity of 2000 f.c., day
temperature of 23*degrees*C, night temperature of 17*degrees*C and
R.H. 60 to 70%.  To test the mutagenic capacity of ozone, plants were
fumigated during the bud stage in plexiglass chambers with the
temperature and humidity controlled by an Aminco Aire H-T Controller.
The air was mixed with ozone produced electrolytically by an Elcar
Viva model ozone generator. The mixture was then blown into a mixing
chamber and then into the fumigation chamber.  The air mixture moved
past the samples to a false floor and was drawn through a bottom
exhaust. Ozone levels were determined by monitoring the fumigation
chamber with a Mast ozone meter, Model 724-2.  Control plants were
placed in a second chamber which was identical to the one described
through which air, without added ozone, was circulated.  Plants were
exposed to a concentraion of 100 pphm of ozone for 4 hours and 8
hours, following which they were returned to the growth chamber until
ready for analysis.<p>

MULLER's (1963) embryo-test was used on siliques 4 and 5 of treated
and control plants, and seeds to produce the next generation were
collected from siliques 1 and 2 (MESKEN and VAN DER VEEN, 1968).
Plants were examined during many stages of growth for morphological
abnormalities.<p>

The degree of sterility, measured as the number of unfertilized ovules
in the siliques, and the number of lethal embryos in the siliques
increased significantly in fumigated plants (Table 1).  Seeds produced
from treated plants showed reduced germination (Table 2).<p>

However these effects of ozone were found only in the treated
generation and it may be presumed to be due to physiological effects
or chromosomal damage rather than to the induction of lethal or
sterility genes.  Ozone did not induce morphological abnormalities
such as chlorophyll, leaf, stem, flower or silique mutants.  Although
a leaf abnormality characterized by a slight notching in the first
true leaf was found in M1 and M2 generations we have no definite proof
that this is due to a gene mutation.<p>

Apparently ozone, at the relatively high concentrations of this
experiment, lowered fertility in A. thaliana but did not have any
morphological mutagenic effects.<p>
