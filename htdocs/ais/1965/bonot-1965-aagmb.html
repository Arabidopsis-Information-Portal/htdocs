Vol 01S: <h2>A Preliminary Study on the Penetration and the Translocation of a Highly Polymerized Heterologous 3E-DNA in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) HEYNH.</h2><p>

S. BONOTTO, M. JACOBS and L. LEDOUX<p>

The uptake of DNA molecules has mostly been studied with micro-
organisms and mammalian cells (see the review of LEDOUX, 1965).  Among
plants a series of studies on the penetration, translocation and fate
of different macromolecules (proteins, RNA, DNA have recently been
made with barley seedlings (LEDOUX and HUART, 1961a,b, 1962a,b, 1963,
1964, 1965).<p>

We have undertaken a similar research on Arabidopsis thaliana, a plant
which apparently offers great advantages for extensive genetic studies
(LAIBACH, 1943; ROBBELEN, 1962; MULLER, 1963; JACOBS, 1964).  In this
note some preliminary results are reported concerning the penetration
and translocation of a macromolecular heterologous 3H-DNA (from
Escherichia coli) into the plant in toto and into some of its isolated
organs. Moreover, some data on the metabolism of the plant after
3H-thymidine incorporation are given.<p>

Materials and Methods<p>

Growth of Arabidopsis: This work has been performed mainly with the
race Wil-2 (Wilna) of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) HEYNH. Some
experiments with the race Landsberg have provided similar results. The
plants were grown on perlite under aseptic conditions (LANGRIDGE,
1957) with continuous illumination (Tubes Phytor, 5000 Lux) at
constant himidity (60%) and temperature (25 *degrees*C). The synthetic
medium was that of HOAGLAND-ARNON (cf. JACOBS, 1964).<p>

Heterologous 3H - DNA preparations: The heterologous 3H-DNA
preparations used in our work were obtained from a thymine-less mutant
of Escherichia coli strain M. 226.8, kindly supplied by Professor WIAR
and grown in a medium containing 3H-thymine (LEDOUX, DAVILA, HUART and
CHARLES, 1963). The 3H-DNA, extracted according to MARMUR (1961) had a
very high specific activity (2-4.106 dpm/*micro* g), few protein-
contaminants (~1%) and almost no RNA. This highly labelled bacterial
DNA constitutes a material of choice for tracer studies with plants
such as Arabidopsis.<p>

Radioactivity determinations: The total tritium radioactivity in the
plant tissues was determined by liquid scintillation using a Packard
Tri-Carb spectrometer. The procedure was that described by DAVILA,
CHARLES, and LEDOUX (1965).<p>

Chromatographic technique: Franctionation of the bacterial 3H-DNA was
obtained by means of the technique of centrifuged DEAE-cellulose paper
pulp columns, already described (DAVILA and LEDOUX, 1962a,b; LEDOUX
and CHARLES, 1964; LEDOUX et al., 1964; DAVILA, CHARLES and LEDOUX,
1965). With this very sensitive method it was possible to obtain
complete elution of DNA's into different fractions of increasing
molecular weight and complexity in a short period of time (2 hours).
The composition of the different chromatographic fractions has already
been reported (DAVILA et al., 1964). It might, however, be of interest
to indicate here the average molecular weights of the 6 fractions,
together with the composition of their eluant:<p>

Results<p>

DNA metabolism of Arabidopsis: Before an assay with 3H-DNA, we tried
to obtain some indications on the DNA metabolism of Arabidopsis by
biochemical methods. We followed the incorporation of 3H-thymidine
into the DNA of the plant. The method of OGUR and ROSEN (1950) has
been applied according to the procedure reported by LEDOUX et al.
(1962). 14 days-old plants were used, which were easy to handle and
showed reproducible morphological characteristics. The 3H-thymidine
given at a concentration of 22 (*micro* g/ml had a specific activity
of 3.5 C/mM.  Our result show that the Arabidopsis plant incorporates
this precursor very poorly and that the incorporation is linear with
respect to the time (Figure 1A).<p>

The centrifuges chromatography can also be used successfully with
plant tissues homogenates. The homogenate, made in 0.14 M NaCl-
0.1 M EDTA adjusted at pH 8, was treated immediately with purified 1%
SDS (sodiumdodecylsulphate). After 10 min agitation in the cold
(4*degrees* C) with twice distilled phenol, saturated with the
NaCl-EDTA mixture, the centrifuged supernatant was put on
DEAE-cellulose paper pulp columns and submitted to fractionation. This
method enabled to follow the 3H- thymidine incorporation into the
different classes of the DNA molecules.  It could be seen in Figure 2A
that with plants grown for 17 days on 3H- thymidine an important label
is found in the more polymerized DNA fraction 6. The label in the
fractions 1 and 2 (= acid-doluble fractions) corresponds to the
3H-thymidine and small molecular weight derived products. For short
times (90 min) the amount of 3H-thymidine incorporated in the plant
DNA was very small (Figure 2B). This result confirms those obtained
with the OGUR and ROSEN procedure (Figure 1A).  It might be emphasized
that by means of this chromatographic method it is possible to follow
the kinetics of the 3H-thymidine incorporation into the different DNA
fractions during the complete life cycle of Arabidopsis.<p>

3H- DNA penetration of 3H - DNA into the plant: A number of
experiments on plants of different age (8, 15, 23 days) and on the
isolated organs have shown a significant penetration of the 3H-DNA.
The kinetics study of this phenomenon shows that the DNA penetration
can be expressed with parabolic curves (Figure 1B and C). The same
behaviour was obtained with 8 days-old plants. It also holds for their
different parts (roots, stem, dicotyledons). Figure 1B and C
respectively were obtained with 15 and 23 days-old plants. Apparently,
the amount of 3H- DNA penetrating the plant is related to its size.<p>

3H - DNA translocation through the roots: In order to detect possible
translocation phenomena from the roots to the rosette leaves and to
the stem, the roots (15-25 cm long) of 42 days-old flowering plants of
Arabidopsis, were placed during different periods of time in contact
with labelled DNA. Each root plant was then washed nine times (3 times
with 0.01 M NaCl, 3 times with unlabelled DNA in 0.01 M Nacl, and 3
times with H2O) in order to eliminate contaminant 3H-DNA. The plant
was cut into 1 cm long segments and these were assayed for total
radioactivity. By this way, it was possible to follow the migration of
the 3H-DNA from the roots through the plant stem (Figure 3). After an
18 hours period of time, the 3H-DNA was found in the 15th cm of the
plant stem<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol01S/vol01S-pg157-fig3.gif">Click here for figure</a><p>

(arrow). A high radioactivity was localized in the roots and in the
rosette leaves. The stem, because of its small size, had a lower
radioactivity. Thus at least a period of 18-24 hours is needed for an
appearance of 3H-DNA in the flower buds at a distance of 15 cm from
the roots (Figure 4). The migration speed of the 3H-DNA molecules
decreases markedly in the stem.<p>

to the time (in cm, measured from the roots)<p>

3H - DNA translocation through the apical meristem and the flower
buds: It was shown above that the 3H-DNA is translocated from the
roots to the rosette leaves, the stem and the flower buds. This
requires a relatively long time, which could make possible a slow
destruction of the DNA molecules by plant enzymes. We have therefore
tried to obtain a penetration of the labelled DNA through the apical
meristem. A drop of 3H-DNA solution was placed by means of a
micropipette on the apex of 15- 20 days old plants, previously treated
(60 min) with 0, 1% tween 20 (BROWN, 1962). The same procedure was
used for flower buds. At the end of the plant life cycle, the seeds
were collected and their radioactivity determined. In a number of
siliques a large percentage of the radioactivity appeared localized in
the seeds (Figure 5A: 1 = envelope; 2 = seeds; 3 = replum). It seems,
however, to be related to the dry weight of each constituent (Figure
5B). With plants grown under discontinuous illumination (8 hrs light/
16 hrs dark) similar results were obtained. The radioactivity found in
these plants was always significant (Table 1). (The results indicate a
certain variability between individuals).  After seed germination,
most of the radioactivity obviously was present in the seedlings.<p>

3H - DNA translocation inside the seed: In some preliminary
experiments, it was found that 3H-DNA penetrated into the seeds
(previously moistened with a 0.01 M NaCl solution) and that this
phenomenon was linear with respect to the time (Figure 6). To
determine whether the 3H-DNA molecules are translocated to the embryo
or whether they remain in some way linked to the integuments, the
3H-DNA treated seeds were germinated and the radioactivity of the
integuments and of the seedlings (6-7 days old) measured. We found
that a certain percentage (37.1%) of the initial radioactivity of the
seeds was lost during germination. The remaining radioactivity (62.9%)
was found in the plants: 24% in the integuments and 38.7% in the
seedlings (Figure 7).<p>

Fate of the translocated 3H-DNA studied by means of a centrifuged
chromatography: The experiments reported above show a significant
penetration and translocation of the 3H-DNA molecules into Arabidopsis
thaliana. It is, however, essential to know something about the
physico- chemical state and the fate of the translocated molecules.
The chromatographic method enables us to obtain useful indications in
that respect.<p>

The chromatographic fractionation of homogenates of plants, rosette
leaves, flower buds, and seeds treated with 3H-DNA showed that a large
amount of the labelled DNA was recovered in fraction 4 (mol.  weight =
500.000) while smaller amounts are found in fractions 5 (m.w.  = 106)
and 6 (m.w. = 5 x 106). Only a very low radioactivity was found in the
acid soluble fractions 1 and 2 and in the fraction 3.<p>

the radioactivity recovered from roots, rosette leaves, flower buds or

Figure 8 shows the elution diagrams of the native 3H-DNA used and of
the radioactivity recovered from: A)roots (15), B) isolated rosette
leaves (8), C) flower buds (21), and D) seeds (120). The period of
contact with the 3H-DNA solution is variable in each case: 15 min for
roots, 3 hrs for rosette leaves, 3 hrs for flower buds and 7 days for
seeds. Above each diagram of Fig 8 the respective amounts of DNA
supplied and taken up by the different organs are indicated.  Let us
note here that the amount of 3H-DNA taken up is very small with
respect to the suppied quantity.<p>

Discussion:<p>

The reported results strongly suggest the possibility of a penetration
and translocation of foreign DNA molecules in Arabidopsis.  The very
low incorporation of 3H-thymidine or of hydrolysed foreign 3H- DNA can
be taken as a strong suggestion that the 3H-DNA recovered in the
plant, incubated with these labelled macromolecules, is not the result
of an enzymatic hydrolysis, followed by de novo resynthesis.  Similar
conclusions were reached with barley (LEDOUX and HUART, 1965).  The
demonstration of the penetration of DNA and of its translocation in
Arabidopsis do not in itself prove that it could produce biological
effects. Also the fate of the absorbed DNA remains unknown.<p>

The used chromatographic method, however, has given some indications
concerning the fate of the 3H-DNA at the physico-chemical point of
view. It can be seen in Fig 8 that the elution diagram of the absorbed
3H-DNA is rather different from the initial one. This fact might be
due either to an enzymatic hydrolysis by sap and intracellular enzymes
or to a selective uptake. The small percentage of uptake makes this
point difficult to solve. Anyway, a certain amount of the initial DNA
seems to be hydrolysed, as the acid-soluble fractions obtained with
plant homogenates (Figure 8) are absent in the 3H-DNA preparation
used.  Let us now consider the possible biological influence of these
facts: the molecular weight of the more important fraction found in
the Arabidopsis homogenates is rather small (mol.  weight = 500.000).
However, it could be sufficiently high to produce biological
modifications. It should be remembered that with bacteria a molecular
weight of 300.000 is sufficient for DNA mediated transformations
(SCHAEFFER, 1964).<p>

Another basic point of discussion concerns the use of bacterial DNA
preparations and the extrapolation of the obtained results to attempts
of biological modifications with isologous or homologous DNA species.
It has been shown that the penetration of nucleic acids into vegetal
cells apparently is not species specific (LEDOUX and HUART, 1962b).
This fact is in favour with the use of the heterologous DNA in order
to obtain the necessary biochemical backgrounds. It appears, however,
necessary, whenever possible, to confirm these results with homologous
DNA's. This is an aim of our investigations in future.  Therefore the
reported results should not be considered as definitive.  They merely
give some informations, and more work is needed before final
conclusions will be reached.<p>

Discussion:<p>

REDEI: The evidence for the uptake of the highly polymerized DNA was
that tritiated thymidine was not taken up. The tritiated thymidine was
not so readily taken up as the DNA which you isolated?<p>

BONOTTO: The plant takes up the tritiated thymidine, but it
incorporates very poorly this labelled precursor in the DNA.<p>

REDEI: Did you try tritiated thymine or thymidilic acid?<p>

BONOTTO: No, I used only tritiated thymidine.<p>

REDEI: Would it be possible, to isolate from Arabidopsis mutants DNA
and do transformation in this way?<p>

BONOTTO: I don't know whether such a mechanism is possible, but
Arabidopsis seems to incorporate easily the foreign DNA and one can
think that in the cells biological sites are available for this DNA.<p>

REDEI: The incorporation of the bacterial DNA did not have any
phenotypic effect?<p>

BONOTTO: We cannot answer yet: this is the aim of our work.<p>

REDEI: This is very interesting. As far as I know, it has been done
only in tissue culture in higher organisms.<p>

BONOTTO: In our Department many experiments have been made with
labelled DNAs on plants. For example in Hordeum, the localization of
the incorporated 3H-DNA has been established: the nuclei were found
labelled (LEDOUX and HUART, personal commun.)<p>

REDEI: You let incorporate some heterologous labelled DNA in the
plants. Did you do any reextraction work of this labelled DNA? Was
this label in the thymidine or was it transferred to any other
compound?<p>

BONOTTO: I tried the method of OGUR and ROSEN (1950). With this method
one is able to extract RNA and DNA, but the RNA fraction was not
labelled.<p>

REDEI: Is it easy really to separate DNA from RNA?<p>

BONOTTO: The procedure of OGUR and ROSEN has been a little modified
(LEDOUX, GALAND and HUART, 1962). In this way, with tritiated
thymidine I have found generally no activity in the RNA fraction.<p>

REDEI: And you don't see the label go to other bases, as cytosine or
some others?<p>

BONOTTO: I have not made any experiment to try this. In general, it
seems difficult, to isolate Arabidopsis DNA with the classical
procedure. I tried to isolate the Arabidopsis DNA with the MARMUR
(1961) procedure, but it was not so well polymerized, as indicated by
its low sedimentation constant. So we try now another method based on
ultracentrifugation. The MARMUR procedure is very suitably for
bacteria and mammalian cells, but with plants, in our hands, it does
not provide a DNA preparation sufficiently polymerized.  We therefore
took the ultracentrifugation method to study the physical-chemical
characteristics of all the used DNAs. With Escherichia coli DNAs,
there was no problem, but from Arabidopsis we got no good polymerized
DNA. It is in our program, however, to improve these techniques for
Arabidopsis, and study its DNA possibly after treatment with tritiated
thymidine in order to get it labelled.<p>
