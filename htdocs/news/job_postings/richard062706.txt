[Arabidopsis] post-doctoral position # Zn tolerance QTL in A. thaliana


A 24 month post-doctoral position is open for recruitment within the  group « Plant adaptation to metals » 
at the Institute of Integrative  Plant Biology (Montpellier ; France http://www.bpmp.cnrs.fr/Groupes/ MetauxAnglais.htm)

"Genetic and physiological characterisations of a QTL governing zinc  tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana"

Because of their intrinsic immobility, plants evolved to cope with  adverse environments such as metal contaminated soils. 
For example,  some plants such as Arabidopsis halleri are naturally hyper-tolerants  to zinc and grow on contaminated areas. 
Despite its sensitivity to  metals, the closed specie A. thaliana, presents significant intra- specific variation for 
Zn tolerance among different accessions.
In this context, a genetic approach in A. thaliana was initiated in  order to identify molecular determinants involved in 
zinc tolerance.  A QTL analysis undertook with the Bay-0 x Shah RIL population  revealed that only two locus are involved 
in the in vitro response of  the primary root length to excess zinc. The locus with the major  effect (LOD score of 8; R2 of 
20%) spans a region of 10 cM in which  different candidate genes are identified. The effect of that locus is  confirmed in 
heterogeneous inbred families.
The applicant will be involved in the fine mapping of that QTL and in  its physiological characterization using already 
available near  isogenic lines. This work will be performed in collaboration with O.  Loudet from INRA Versailles.


Solid backgroung in molecular biology and experience in quantitative  genetics are required. Previous experience with 
plants is not a  prerequisite.



Applicants must apply following guidelines detailed on the INRA  
website (http://www.international.inra.fr/join_us/positions/ post_doctoral_positions/post_doctoral_research_positions) 
and send  the application forms to both the INRA “Plant Biology” research  department (bv@ensam.inra.fr) and to 
Odile Richard  (Odile.Richard@ensam.inra.fr).
