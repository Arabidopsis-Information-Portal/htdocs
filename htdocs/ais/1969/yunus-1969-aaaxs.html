Preliminary studies revealed that species of Arabidopsis in Tajikistan
are very polymorphic.  Therefore it is important to collect and
investigate different forms from various environment.  Species of
Arabidopsis are localized almost on whole territory of Tajikistan. Due
to the very different climatic and ecological conditions, the period
of vegetation and fruiting time throughout Tajikistan is very variable
(Figure) The physiological peculiarities of different ecotypes of
Arabidopsis thaliana, A. pumila, A. mollissima and A. korschinskyi are
under study.<p>
