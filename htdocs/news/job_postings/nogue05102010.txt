Postdoctoral Position Available in INRA Versailles, France

A post-doctoral researcher position is available at INRA Versailles
(Institut Jean-Pierre Bourgin). The project involves the groups of Catherine
Rameau and Fabien Nogue and will consist in the creation of Orobanche
resistant rapeseed using biotechnology approaches.
The parasitic plant, Orobanche is a major agriculture pest around the
Mediterranean sea where it constitutes a major cause of crop damage.
Strigolactones are small molecules exuded in the rhizosphere which trigger
seed germination of Orobanche. The strategy proposed is to obtain rapeseed
plants which do not produce strigolactones from roots. The miRNA strategy
and gene targeting using the meganucleases technology will be used in this
project.
The position will use molecular genetics and plant cell biology.
