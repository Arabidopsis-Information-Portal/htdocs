<h2>COMPARISON OF FAST NEUTRONS AND X-RAYS IN RESPECT TO GENETIC EFFECTS ACCOMPANYING INDUCED CHROMOSOME ABERRATIONS: INDUCTION AND ANALYSIS OF TRANSLOCATIONS IN ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA</h2><p>

K. Sree Ramulu and J. Sybenga<p>

INTRODUCTION<p>

Ionizing radiations induce both mutation and chromosome
rearrangements, but the relative frequencies of induction of the two
types of genetic damage are not necessarily independent of the quality
of the radiation. One of the ways to compare the relative frequencies
of the two types of radiation damage with different qualities of
radiation is to study the viability of homozygotes of induced
translocations. In order to separate breakpoint damage from mutations
elsewhere in the genome, the effect of outcrossing on translocation
homozygote viability can be used. It has already been established for
X-rays that low doses result in less background damage per induced
rearrangement than high doses: low dose induced homozygotes have a
better viability than high dose induced ones (Ytterborn, 1970; Sobels,
1972).<p>

We propose the possibility that fast neutrons, because of their higher
LET and RBE, may cause less genetic background damage per induced
aberration than X-rays, but that this may be compensated by more
breakpoint damage. The difference, if it exists, might be made use of
for the production of rearrangements for practical purposes (insect
control, plant breeding).<p>

In spite of the fact that Arabidopsis thaliana is notoriously
unfavourable for cytological studies, we have chosen it as it permits
the handling of large numbers of individuals and is easy to cross. Our
choice may contribute to the development of Arabidopsis cytogenetics,
in respect of techniques as well as the production and application of
translocations for genetic analysis, the induction of specific
duplications and modifying linkage relationships.<p>

MATERIAL AND METHODS<p>

Genotypes<p>

Arabidopsis thaliana c.v. Landsberg erecta (2n=10) was used in the
present study. For backcrossing of the translocation lines, a male
sterile line of Landsberg erecta developed at the Department of
Genetics, Agricultural University, Wageningen, was used, while for
outcrossing of the translocation lines another cultivar, Estland was
utilized.<p>

Irradiation tratments<p>

X-irradiation was applied with a PHILIPS deep-therapy apparatus
operating at 320 kV and 9mA with an additional 0.025 Cu, 1.0 A1
filter. The dose rate administered was 4 Gy*/min. The source of fast
neutrons was the BARN reactor at ITAL, Wagningen. The reactor was set
at 100 kW and the irradiation treatments were given at a dose rate of
1 Gy/min.<p>

After 5 days on wet filter paper at 2*degrees*C and redrying on filter
paper for 24 hours at 24*degrees*C (for breaking dormancy), the seeds
were submerged in water for 2 hours at 22*degrees*C prior to
irradiation. Immediately after irradiation, the seeds were sown on
perlite with mineral nutrients. The plants were grown under controlled
conditions (temperature 20*degrees*C day (16 hours); 18*degrees*C
night (8 hours); relative humidity 50-60%; light 8500-9000 lux).<p>

Semi-strility tests<p>

For the detection of semi-sterile plants, both pollen and ovule
sterilities were scored. Pollen sterility was determined by staining
with ALEXANDER's stain (ALEXANDER, 1969), while ovule sterility was
assessed through Moller's embryo test (Moller, 1963). The seeds were
harvested from the fifteenth or sixteenth siliqua on the main shoot of
the semi sterile M1 plants, where chimerism plays no role.<p>

To distinguish clearly between translocation-sterility and genic
sterility in the M2, and to restrict laborious meiotic tests, the
selected M2 plants (semi-sterile by both pollen and ovule tests) were
selfed and segregation for semi-sterility was studied again in M3. The
M2 lines giving M3 segregation for semi-sterility (pollen and ovules)
were selected and the semi-sterile plants were examined meiotically
for the occurence of translocations in hetroygous condition. Since no
information is available in Arabidopsis whether semi-sterility can be
realiably used to detect the translocation heterozygotes, this was
necessary.<p>

Meiosis: methods of fixation and staining<p>

The inflorescences were fixed in freshly prepared 3:1 absolute
alcohol: glacial acetic acid saturated with feric chloride and stored
at 2*degrees*C or at room temperature (22 +/- 1*degree*C) for 1-7
days. As and when necessary for examination, the inflorescences were
submerged, after draining off the fixative, in a few drops of
acetocarmine stain (1.5%) to which had been added a few drops of
saturated solution of ferric chloride in glacial acetic acid. Smear
preparations can be made 6 hours after storing in the stain at room
temperature. It should be noted that the inflorescences can be stored
in the stain for at least a week at 2*degrees*C with satisfactory
results. Under our conditions of growing, about 0.5 mm flower bud size
appeared to coincide with meiosis. Since the anthers are very small,
the removal from the flower buds and selection of anthers have to be
done under a stereo microscope (10x). The anthers from 4-5 buds can be
mounted in a single drop of 45% acetic acid under a coverslip and can
be examined for the desired stages of meiosis. However, with some
practice one can select only the suitable anthers for mounting and
squashing merely on the basis of the bud size.<p>

This method allows satisfactory staining of the meiotic chromosomes
and to determine easily the chromosome configurations. With experience
it may also be possible to recognize a hetrozygous interchange at
pachytene.<p>

RESULTS<p>

Choice of the doses<p>

For the induction of translocations, low (optimum) doses of ionizing
radiations are preferred since high doses may cause more genetic side
effects (background damage). Lower doses, however, require large
numbers to be screened. The doses of X-rays and fast neutrons selected
for the present study are supposed to be low enough to give only
limited damage as both X-ray and fast neutron doses permit high
survival, i.e., 70-90%. Ovule sterility induced by the higher doses
does not exceed 50%. The choice of the doses is based on
investigations (results unpublished) carried out at the Department of
Genetics, Agricultural University.<p>

The doses were selected such that for both types of radiations two
doses could be compared, each of which had an equivalent in the other
radiation type which caused the same translocation frequency. Thus,
background damage could be compared for doses which had approximately
the same effectiveness in translocation induction. In the present
experiment it appeared that these are not as comparable as expected on
the basis of earlier investigations.<p>

Induction and isolation of semi-sterile plants<p>

The frequencies of semi-sterile plants in M1 and M2 after treatments
with X-rays and fast neutrons are given in Table 1.<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol16/vol16-pg30-tab1.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

Table 1: Frequency of semi-sterile plants in the M1 and M2 after
treatment with X-rays and fast neutrons. Semi-sterility: 20-60%
sterility.<p>

In the M1 semi-sterility was determined by ovule sterility, while in
the M2 it was assessed by both ovule and pollen sterilities. The range
of semi-sterility considered to indicate potential translocation
heterozygosity was 20-60%.<p>

Of the 3554 M1 plants analysed from X-ray and fast neutron treatments,
577 (16%) were ovule semi-sterile. Of these, 487 were grown in the M2
(approximately 7000 plants) to assess pollen fertility and segregation
for semi-sterility. As can be seen from the data in Table 1, 192
segregated 1:1 for ovule fertile: semi-sterile, but only 147 seemed to
segregate both for pollen and ovule semi-sterility. Segregation for
only pollen semi-sterility was not assessed. Fast neutron treatments
were several times more effective than X-ray treatments.<p>

Chromosome association in meiosis of the semi-sterile plants<p>

Of the 147 M2 pollen and ovule semi-sterile lines, 22 have been
analysed cytologically up till the present. Although all segregated in
the M3 in fertile:semi-sterile plants approximately in a 1:1 ration,
only 11 lines could be shown to contain translocations, 8 from fast
neutron treatments and 3 from X-ray treatments. The other 11 lines all
had consistently 5 pairs of chromosomes in meiosis I in approximately
10 cells analysed per line. In all translocation hetrozygotes a
quadrivalent was observed (Figure 1).<p>

quadrivalent and 3 bivalents.<p>

Semi-sterility of the intrchange heterozygotes<p>

After translocation hetrozygosity had been established, a detailed
analysis of fertility (pollen and ovule) was carried out. The data
indicate that the average sterility of the hetrozygotes ranged from
about 40% to 50%.<p>

Isolation of translocation homozygotes<p>

During the isolation of the translocation lines, hetrozygotes were
self-pollinated to recover homozygotes. The progeny from selfed
heterozygotes should segregate in semi-sterile and fertile plants
approximately in a ratio of 1:1. Among the fertile progeny plants,
theoretically 50% normal. Crosses of the ferile progeny with the
parent genotype or another standard genotype will give semi-sterile
F1's if a translocation homozygote is involved, and fertile F1's if
the types tested are normal.<p>

Table 2: Segregation of M3 progenies after inbreeding of the M2
interchange heterozygotes.<p>

A genic male sterile line of the parent genotype (Landsberg erecta)
was used for test-crossing of the fertile progenies. Test crosses were
also performed between the fertile progenies and c.v. Estland. The
data on the segregation after selfing of the eleven translocation
hetrozygotes are shown in Table 2. Although the number of progeny
plants in each of the translocation lines is not high, the data
indicate that they segregate in semi-sterile and fertile plants
approximately in a ratio of 1:1. Homozygotes occured in all the
translocation lines except in T1. However, in T2, T6 and T10 no
normals were recovered. The morphological characteristics, growth and
flowering were normal in all the homozygotes of the ten
translocations. Their pollen and ovules were fully fertile.<p>

DISCUSSION<p>

The results obtained in the present preliminary study show that the
frequency of true semi-steriles in the M2 was much lower than that
found in the M1 after X-ray and fast neutron treatments. This could be
possible due to the fact that the determination of semi-sterility in
the M1 was based on ovule sterility alone. Although ovule sterility is
correlated with pollen sterility, it deviates to some extent probably
due to maternal effects, factors affecting fertilization processes or
background mutations. Also in the M2 itself some lines considered as
semi-sterile based on ovule sterility were proved to be fertile as
determined by pollen stainability The possibility that chimerism or
cryptic structural changes may be responsible to some extent for the
observed sterility in the M1, can not be excluded.<p>

Homozygotes were recovered from 10 out of the 11 translocation lines
and they were normal in morphology, growth and fertility. The
non-occurrence of homozygotes in T1 can be due to breakpoint -
associated or closely linked lethality. The complete absence of
normals in T2, T6 and T10 suggests that lethal recessives have been
induced in the normal chromosomes. This means that background damage
may be important. The number of progeny plants analysed from the
selfed heterozygotes of T2 and T10 was rather low, but for T6 it was
sufficient. Three of the present sample of 11 translocations were
induced by X-rays and 8 by fast neutrons. The translocation which was
not homozygous viable and the 3 lines without normals were induced by
fast neutrons. The present sample is still too small to permit a
conclusion on homozygote viability differences. The analysis is being
completed.<p>

SUMMARY<p>

As part of a reseach programme on the comparison of fast neutrons and
X-rays with respect to genetic effects accompanying chromosome
aberrations, studies are being carried out on the induction and
analysis of translocations in Arabidopsis thaliana. The present report
gives some preliminary results. Several semi-sterile lines have been
induced by fast neutron and X-ray treatments. Up till the present 11
translocation heterozygotes have been detected cytologically and
analysed. Homozygotes were recovered from 10 out of the 11
translocation lines and all were normal in morphology, growth and
fertility. This sample, which is yet too small for a definite
conclusion, does not confirm the hypothesis that fast neutrons induce
less background damage per rearrangement produced than do X-rays.<p>
