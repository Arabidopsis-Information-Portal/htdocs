<h2> The range of reversibility of temperature damage in ecological races of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) HEYNH.</h2><p>

The resistance to damage caused by high temperature varies between
ecological races or even within a single selection line of Arabidopsis
(ASHRAF, 1970a,b).  It has also been shown that this reaction is
affected by genetical changes (ASHRAF, 1967, 1971).  The following
paper presents data on the capacity of ecological races to recover
after a high temperature treatment.  For this purpose the very races
were used that were used in the earlier experiments (ASHRAF, 1970b).
The temperature resistance of the cell and its reversibility was
determined according to ALEXANDROV et al.  (1963).  The following
table summarises the obtained data.<p>

In case of the races Enkheim and A-8 the range of rversibility was
investigated with vernalized and unvernalized plants; but we failed to
find any difference.<p>

Table: The range of reversibility of temperature damage in various
ecological races of Arabidopsis thaliana<p>

Furthermore, ALEXANDROV et al. (1963) had shown that the range of
reversibility of the temperature damage significantly narrows at an
increase of the treatment time with a correspondingly lower
temperature.  This effect is also true for Arabidopsis if diploid and
polyploid plants are compared (ASHRAF, 1967).  But in the cases
presented here this shortening could not be demonstrated. From a total
of 6 races only one (Copenhagen) revealed a difference between the
reversibility ranges after 5 minutes and 80 minutes of heating. The
rest showed identical reversibility in spite of a 16 fold difference
in the duration of the temperature exposure. This identical reaction
includes races showing significantly different levels of temperature
resistance (e.g., Blanz as compared to Enkheim).  Thus there seems to
be no tight correlationship between the level of thermal resistance
and the recovery from this damage.<p>
