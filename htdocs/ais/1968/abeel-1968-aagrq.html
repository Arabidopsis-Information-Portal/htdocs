The existence of the RNA-transmethylase enzyme in A. thaliana was
tested by using sRNA extracted from a mutant of E.coli, strain K
12-58/161 F- which synthesized RNA in the absence of methionine (BOREK
and RYAN, 1958).  The enzyme mediates the incorporation of methyl
groups from S-adenosylmethionine-methyl C14 into the nucleotides of
the sRNA.  The enzyme activity was measured on the basis of the
radioactivity appearing in the sRNA after incubation with the enzyme.
The sRNA was then hydrolized and submitted to electrophoresis. The
experiments demonstrated the existence of transmethylase in A.
thaliana.  It was also found, that the four main nucleotides from E.
coli were methylated to a different extent, when submitted to the
action of the transmethylase of A. thaliana.<p>

Experimental procedure: The sRNA from E. coli was extracted
following the method of MONIER et al. (1960) and KIRBY (1956); the
purification was made by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose.  The
plants, 5 weeks old, were frozen and homogenized. The medium for the
extraction of enzymes contained: 0.1 M Tris buffer, pH 7.2, with 16 mM
MgC12, 20 mM potassium-metabisulfite and 0.45 mM sucrose (ANDERSON and
ROWAN, 1966).  The assay mixture for the methylation consisted of 2
micromolar 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 microM triethanolamin buffer, pH 8.8
10 nanomolar C 14-CH3-S-adenosylmethionine, 100 nanomolar nucleotides as
methyl deficient sRNA, and sufficient enzyme to incorporate at least 1
picomolar  groups (HURWITZ, et al., 1964).  After incubation for 20 minutes
at 38*degrees*C 5 microM sodium pyrophosphate, 0.05 ml of 0.5% bovine
plasma albumin, and 0.2 ml of 7% HC104 were added and the insoluble
material removed by centrifugation.  The pellet was resuspended and
washed twice again.  One part from the washed pellet was dissolved
with 1.5 ml of 0.2 M NH 4 OH, decanted on metal planchets, dried and
counted. The other part after hydrolysis of the sRNA was submitted to
electrophoresis with pyridine acetate buffer, pH 3.6, at 2000 volts.
Nucleotides were localized in the UV-light and the radioactivity
counted.<p>
