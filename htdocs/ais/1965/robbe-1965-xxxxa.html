Vol 01S: <h2>FOREWORD</h2><p>

This volume contains the written version of papers delivered at the
First International Symposium on "Arabidopsis Research" held at the
Institute of Agronomy and Plant Breeding, University of Gottingen, on
April 21-24, 1965. The purpose in organizing this meeting was to bring
together people working with this versatile model plant for
developmental and genetical research.<p>

An important part of the symposium were the discussions; they resulted
in a valuable exchange of ideas and methodological experiences.  The
recorded discussions were subjected to some editorial abridgment after
transcription from tapes and revised by each participant.<p>

It is a pleasure to convey special thanks to all the participants who
contributed so actively to the success of the meeting. Many thanks
should also go to Professor A. SCHEIBE, Director of the Institut fur
Pflanzenbau und Pflanzenzuchtung, and to all members of his staff for
helpful assistance in the oraganization of the syposium. Sincere
apprecition is recorded for a grant of the "Univrsitatsbund Gottingen
e.V." which established the financial basis of the conference.<p>
