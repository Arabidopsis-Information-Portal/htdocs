*  Several people have asked me how we grow such good healthy 
Arabidopsis plants.  Keith Partridge, our excellent plant-growth assistant, 
gives them daily attention and care and this is the method he finds works 
very well.

1.  GROWTH ROOM
  (i) 20oC  16 h day length
15oC  8 h dark (night depression 5oC).
  (ii) Relative humidity 60-70%.
  (iii) Philips fluorescent tubes, warm white, giving c. 70 wm-2

2.  SOIL
  (i) Fisons' F2 seed and cutting compost.

3.  SOWING
  (i) Two 1/4" deep seed-trays (14" x 9") are filledwith Fisons F2,  to about 
1/4" from the top of the tray and then levelled off and firmed with a flat 
piece of wood (8" x 4" x1 /2") bolted to a strong handle.
  (ii) Seeds are sown as thinly as possible and covered lightly with extra 
soil using a fine sieve (about 1/8" diameter holes).  The seed tray is then 
covered with a domed plastic-seed-tray cover to eliminate any further 
watering until well after germination (c. 4 days).  For the first week after 
germination watering is with a fine spray from a spray gun.  After that, a 
watering-can with a very fine spray is suitable.

 *  Our gardener stresses that he thinks the watering mode and using the 
seed tray with a fitted  cover are both very important as the plants are 
very delicate when they first come through.   This is particularly true for
