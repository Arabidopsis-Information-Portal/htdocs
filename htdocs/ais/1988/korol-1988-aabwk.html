Sex differences in the amount of recombination have been poorly
studied in higher plants (Zhuchenko and Korol, 1985). However, this
kind of knowledge is necessary for understanding recombination,
evolution, genetic control, as well as for improving breeding methods.<p>

Redei (1965) was the first who draw attention to sex differences in
recombination frequency (rf) in Arabidopsis. He attributed these
differences to the pleiotropic effect of Gf mutation of chromosome 2
which, according to the author's findings, gives rise to segregation
distortions as well as sex differences in rf (for segment Gf - py rf
male/rf female = 1.59). The latter conclusion cannot be considered to
be sound since the author found sex differences in rf in a Gf x py
cross without comparing with the result obtained in the Gf+
background.<p>

One can also indirectly judge about sex differences in rf in
Arabidopsis based on the work of Koornneef et al. (1983).
Unfortunately, the direction of test crosses is not indicated in this
paper and, therefore, it is only possible to ascertain the mere
presence of sex differences in rf without relating them to a
particular sex. Using the data from the above work, we determined the
values of rf for a number of segments in both sexes. For segments an -
chll, an - disl, an - dis2, and chll - thl, dis2 - chl of chromosome
l, recombination in different sexes differs in 1.43, 2.14, 1.57, 1.67,
1.91 times, respectively; for segments hy4- th3, hy4 - ap2, th3 -
cer2, and th3 - ap2 of chromosome 4 - by the order of 2.15, 1.50,
6.86, 2.27, respectively. Conversely, for zones chll-disl (chr.1),
chl2 - er (chr.2) hy4 - cer2 and cer2 - ap2 (chr.4), and ms - ttg
(chr.5) sex differences in rf seem to be absent. Data have also been
obtained in our work indicating rf differences in certain zones of
Arabidopsis genome during male and female meiosis.<p>

In our experiments we used the race Landsberg "erecta" and the
multimarker lines an'albl'disl, an'disl'er, chl'apl'clvl'er (chr.1),
py'er'hy3, cer8'as'er'cp2, as'hyl (chr.2), gll'hy2'tt5'er (chr.3), f
ca 'cer4'cp3'er,cer2'ap2'er (chr4) and hy5'yi'er (chr.5), kindly
supplied to us by Dr. M. Koornneef (Wageningen University). Line
ms'ttg'lu (chr.5) hae been obtained in our recombination work. The
amount of recombination in male and female meiosis were determined by
crosses of the tester x F 1 and F 1 x testr, respectively, or by one
of these crosses and F 2.<p>

Arabidopsis genome (indicated values rf male/rf female).<p>

Higher combination values have been revealed in male meiosis for all
the segments examined, which is consistent with the data obtained by
Redei (1965). This effect is of pronounced segment-specific character
(Figure 1). The differences observed are largest for those segments
ttg - lu, cer4 - cp3, ap2 - cer2 and an albl, and smallest - for zones
chl - apl and apl - clvl (Table 1)<p>

Table 1: Sex differences of crossing over frequency in Arabidopsis.<p>

In segment an - disl, a decrease in recombination level during female
meiosis is accompanied by an increase in the frequency of double
exchanges compared with male meiosis, i.e., lowering of positive
interference (C female =0.33 +- 0.22, C male = 1.47 +- 0.98). Although
this is precisely the opposite to what can be expected on the basis of
general notions of interference, similar disagreement between the rf
and interference changes has also been found with other objects
(Zhuchenko and Korol, 1985).<p>

Male and female generative tissues of Arabidopsis are located very
close to another (fractions of a millimetre) and formed out of few
stem cells. This is supported by experiments on the induction of
chimerism (Shevchenko and Grinikh, 1981). Consequently, sex
differences in rf present in a given plant result from sex
differentiation of flower tissues rather than from differences in
external (relative to meiocytes) conditions. These differences seem to
be to tissue-specific activity of genes for recombination and to
differences in spatial organization of chromatin as a reactive system.<p>

Previously, Rick (1971) pointed to a possible involvement of the
nucleolus in recombination, and Rhoades (1978) showed sex differences
in rf to be due in maize to near-centromere heterochromatine knobs in
euchromatine (the distance to the centromere). In connection with
these papers, it is interesting to note that in A. thaliana one of the
greatest sex differences in rf have been found by us in the
nucleolar-organiziang chromosome 4 carrying large blocks of
heterochromatine (see Koornneef et al., 1983).<p>

We wish to thank Dr. M. Koornneef for sending a large collection of
multimarker lines, which we used in this study.<p>
