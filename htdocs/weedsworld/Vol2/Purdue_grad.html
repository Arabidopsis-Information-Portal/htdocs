</H2>


The <A HREF="http://www.biochem.purdue.edu/~genetics/index1.htm">Purdue Genetics 
Program</a> (PGP) is pleased to announce the availability of 
a number of graduate fellowships in Plant Genetics through an NSF Graduate
Training Grant. <P>

PGP is an interdepartmental graduate training program offering graduate 
students optimal flexibility in designing a graduate experience to meet 
their needs.  We do this in two important ways.   <P>

First, an incoming PGP student selects from nine different departments that 
best suits their long term interests.  These departments include Agronomy, 
Animal Sciences, Botany and Plant Pathology, Biological Sciences, 
Biochemistry, Chemistry, Entomology, Horticulture, and Veterinary Pathobiology. <P>

Second, an incoming PGP student selects from over 40 different faculty, 
those laboratories involved in research that is most suitable for the 
training experience that the student desires. <P>

All of this process is coordinated through the interdepartmental program to 
provide each student with training that is broad, well-rounded and of 
excellent quality in genetics.  This training includes a core curriculum of 
four genetics courses as well as a PGP Distinguished Lectureship that 
invites internationally recognized geneticists to the Purdue campus.  These 
scientists provide students with exposure to a diversity of modern 
innovations and cutting edge research in all area of genetics. <P>

These fellowships are available for September 1995 enrollment.   <P>
