CSIRO PLANT INDUSTRY, CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA

 

Post Doctoral Fellow - Plant Molecular Biology

$60K - $66K Plus Superannuation

 

We require an enthusiastic Post Doctoral Fellow to join our research
team investigating the role of changes in chromatin structure in
controlling plant development. Our current focus is on the actions of
polycomb group proteins in plant development. This position will use a
"ChIP on chip" approach to find the sites where polycomb group proteins
interact with the genome, study how these interactions change in
development or under different environmental conditions and determine
the range of genes that are regulated by polycomb group proteins.

 

The successful applicant will have a record of achievement in molecular
biology research and a strong interest in developmental biology.
Experience carrying out chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments,
working with proteins and microarray technology analysis is desirable.
Strong communication skills and the ability to work both independently
and as part of a team are essential, as are sound organisational skills
and the ability to prioritise tasks to meet deadlines.

 

This position is for a term of 3 years
