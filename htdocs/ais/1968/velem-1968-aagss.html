In order to test the relations between some characters of the first
(M1) generation and the frequency of mutations in the second (M2)
generation after the mutagenic treatment, we combined the technique of
CETL (1965, and pers. communic.) for the measurement of developmental
characters and of MULLER (1963) for the detection of recessive
embryonic and chlorophyll lethals. The seeds were treated with 0.2 mM
and 0.3 mM methylnitrosourea for 24 hrs and sown in constant distances
and depth in the soil.  One part of plants was then cultivated during
the whole life cycle in the greenhouse (in June and July) and the
second part in a growth chamber with constant humidity (75%) and
temperature (18+/-1*degree*C).  In the first month the plants grew
under an 8 hrs day, lather under a long day (16 hrs).  On each plant
the number of leaves in the rosettes (y), the number of days between
the emergence and the appearance of flower primordia (x) and the
number of mutant seeds in all siliquae (mc) were determined.  Under
greenhouse conditions the mean number of rosette leaves was
significantly lower and the length of vegetative phase significantly
shorter than under the conditions in the growth chamber.  This did
not, however, influence the frequency of recessive lethals (Talbe 1).
We also did not find any correlation between the frequency of
mutations and the number of rosette leaves (y:mc) or number of days to
the appearance of flower primordia (x:mc) Table 2).<p>
