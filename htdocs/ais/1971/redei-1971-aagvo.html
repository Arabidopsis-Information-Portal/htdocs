The frequency of hereditary cytoplasmic alterations is only a small
fraction of that of nuclear gene mutations in the majority of
organisms.  In maize several hundred chromosomal genes have been
analyzed but only about half dozen plastom factors were discovered.
In Arabidopsis ROBBELEN (1962) reported 23 cases of maternally
inherited plastid variations verified either by reciprocal crosses or
by the microscopic detection of cells with "mixed" plastids.  ARNOLD
and CRUSE (1966) confirmed ROBBELEN's discovery that in Arabidopsis -
contrary to Oenothera- plastid variation can be induced by X-rays.<p>

Similar variations have been frequently observed also in our
laboratory, but these plants could not be maintained.  There is no
information in the literature how many of the reported cases of the
plastom mutations of Arabidopsis are maintained in other laboratories.<p>

A particular type of plastom alteration was obtained and analyzed in
detail by ROBBELEN (1966).  A nuclear gene (am) when homozygous
induced structural alterations in the plastid and the newly arisen
defect displayed maternal transmission independent from the genome.
Thus am behaved as a specific plastom mutator. This unusual condition,
similar to the ij (RHOADES, 1943) or cm (STROUP, 1970) systems in
maize can be maintained easily through several generations.<p>

A mutation designated as chm (chloroplast mutator) showing
similarities to am were obtained in our laboratory in an EMS-treated
gl population (LI and REDEI, 1967, unpublished).  The affected plants
display white or yellow sectors often of considerable size; sometimes
however only small discolored dots appear on the normal green
background.  About 10% of the selfed progeny show no appreciable
number of green plastids in the cotyledons, approximately one fourth
of the young seedlings are sectorial after emergence. Frequently all
selfed plants become variegated before maturity, some other times
there is a strong selection against the variegated tissus. When chm is
used as female the majority of the F1 plants are variegated, the
reciprocal F1 plants are not sectorial, however.  In the F2 of the
first type of cross the extent of variegation is similar to that of
the preceeding generation.  In the reciprocal F2 - contrary to the F1
- variegation is observed in 25% or in somewhat lower percent of the
plants. Thus the chm factor of Arabidopsis behaves differently from cm
of maize where the frequency of the variegated plants in both types of
F2 generations is about the same, approximately 5%.  It seems that chm
is capable of inducing hereditary alterations in the plastids at at
least three different "sites". .  ROBBELEN (1966) did not mention that
am would induce more than one type of plastid alteration.  Data of a
limited extent indicate that chm belongs to linkage group 3.  Linkage
information on am has not been reported yet. Since the phenotype of
chm plants resembles to that of homozygotes for am they may be
allelic, and in this case the use of different gene symbols is not
permissible. Just as genes with complete dominance cannot be tested
directly for allelism, the conventional allelism test is not
applicable for plastid mutators, because the autonomous plastom is
maternally inherited, and both types of F1 plants are expected to be
similar even in case of non-allelism (contrary to the description of
STROUP, 1970).  The difficulties can be overcome, however, by a simple
genetic manipulation.  If an individual hetrozygous for am (am+/am)
and possessing normal cytoplasm (derived from am+/am+ female) is
produced, this plant is expected to be of non-variegating type.  Using
such a genotype as pistillate parent and crossed with a pollen donor
of chm/chm constitution the immediate progeny may be of two
alternative types.  If am and chm are non-allelic all the immediate
offspring is expected to be nonvariegating.  In case of allelism
theoretically half (practically, a significant percent) of the
population is supposed to be sectorial.  In cas eof non-allelism, the
bulked second generation of the cross should segregate 3 normal - 2
variegating (if penetrance and expressivity are good).  In case of
allelism the selfed second generation, under ideal conditions, is
expected to be 3 normal and 5 variegating.  Localization of a gene in
a different linkage group does not absolutely rule out allelism
because "new mutations" at the same gene locus may arise by
transposition.<p>

Recently another viable plastom mutant - nonidentical with the chm
class - has been obtained. Characterization is underway.<p>
