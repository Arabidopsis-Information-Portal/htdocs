Studies concerning genotype by environment interaction and its
evolutionary significance in A. thaliana have been reported by several
researchers (Griffing and Langridge, 1963; Li and Redei, 1969;
Vykhristova and Shumnyi, 1973). The prime purpose of this study was to
estimate the genetic variability in a diallel cross design of 5 races
(Enkheim, Langen l, Estland, Oystese and A 136) over three temperature
conditions, and to ascertain the proportion of the total variability
ascribable to genotype temperature interaction. In this paper only the
results for flowering day recorded as the number of days from sowing
to the opening of the first flower were reported.<p>

The phenotypic expression of flowering day, showed that early
flowering is favored at optimum temperature (24*degrees*C), because
all races and their F1 hybrids flowered earlier at that temperature
than their counterparts at lower (20*degrees*C) and higher temperature
(28*degrees*C). The analysis of variance on flowering data of 25
genotypes including 5 pure homozygous races and 10 pairs of reciprocal
F1 hybrids over the fixed temperature ranges indicated that
temperature effects are significantly different, and genotypes
exhibited significant difference in their over-all response to the
temperature (Table 1).<p>

For better understanding of how genic action is reflected in
fluctuating temperatures, genotypic effect, namely genetic effect was
further partitioned into components ascribable to general combining
ability as male and as female parent (denoted as M1F), general
heterosis (b1), differential heterosis (b2), specific hetrosis (b3),
and residual reciprocal effect (r). Variance components attributable
to the genetic effects, temperature, replication and interaction were
estimated and the values of these estimates are shown in Table 2.<p>

Table 2: Various variance components for flowering day<p>

The significance of general combining ability variance (*sigma* sq.M,
*sigma*sq.F) and their high percentage of variation in relation to the
total genetic variance shown in parentheses revealed that the genetic
variation in flowering day is predominantly additive, where additive
variance can be estimated by sum of *sigma* sq.M and
*sigma*sq.F. Although percentage of b1 variance was low, it was
detected to be significantly different from zero and interaction
between b1 and temperation was also statistically significant.<p>

It was observed that flowering day was delayed at temperature of
20*degrees*C and 28*degrees*C for both pure races and F1 hybrids.
However, the general heterosis is marked at higher temperature,
28*degrees*C. This may suggest that greater heterozygote stability
occurred at temperature higher than optimum.<p>
