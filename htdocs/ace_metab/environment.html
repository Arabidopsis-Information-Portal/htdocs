<H1>ACEDB environment variables</H1>
<I>Note:</I> Applies to code 4.0pre, 1995-05-22

<DL>

<DT> HOME
<DD> File: w1/filsubs.c <br>
Used to substitute in paths containing a tilde. This variable is set
by your operating system/shell, and should probably not be tampered with.


<DT> OPENWINHOME
<DD> whooks/quovadis.c <br>

<DT> ACEDB_HTML_DEBUG_MODE
<DD> File: w1/help.c<br>
If this environment variable is set, the www help system will print
the name of the file it is trying to display on standard error. This
is intended for debugging, and for finding the exact name a file needs
to have to be displayed.

<DT> ACEDB_DATA
<DD> File: w1/parse.c; w4/update.c (twice); wace/pmapace.c; wace/stockace.c; <br>

The path to the directory containing rawdata or update files. Defaults
to $ACEDB/rawdata. Will be shown as starting directory in parse/update
and write/dump operation file chooser dialogs. Note that this the only
way to tell ace that the update files are not in
$ACEDB/rawdata. pmapace is a standalone program to convert contig9
data into ace. stockace is a standalone program to convert cgcstrn
data into ace.

<DT> ACEDB_LPR
<DD> File: w2/graphprint.c<br>
This should be set to a command that will print a document on your
system. Ace will also try to build generic system calls, but if your
setup needs special handling, set ACEDB_LPR to that
command. &lt;insert example&gt;.

<DT> PWD
<DD> File: w2/graphprint.c; w4/session.c<br>
Used by ace to set current working directory. This variable is set by
your operating system/shell, and should probably not be tampered with.

<DT> ACEDB_MONO
<DD> File: w2/graphxlib.c<br>
Set to force monochrome output on the screen. The program should be
able to figure out on it's own how to set the screen depth, but
sometimes this doesn't work.

<DT> ACEDB_COLOUR and ACEDB_COLOR
<DD> File: w2/graphxlib.c<br>
Set to use colors. This will overrride ACEDB_MONO.

<DT> ACEDB_GRAY and ACEDB_GREY
<DD> File: w2/graphxlib.c<br>
Use alternate way of making stipples for monochrome screen.

<DT> ACEDB_SCREEN_FIX
<DD> File: w2/graphxt.c (commented out)<br>
&lt;???&gt;

<DT> ACEDB
<DD> File: w4/session.c; w9/diskdump.c; w9/diskfix.c<br>
The directory where the database directory and the wspec directory
lives. No longer needed - you can give the same info on the command line.

<DT> ACEDB_NO_BANNER
<DD> File: w4/session.c; w4/tacemain.c (4 times); w4/xacemain.c (3 times)<br>
Do not print so much info on standard out.
<UL>
<LI> &lt;w4/session.c&gt; skip message about byte-swapping for non-native database.
<LI> &lt;w4/tacemain.c&gt; skip main start message, do not print
wspec/datainfo.wrm, do not give initial help message, do not print a
comment on how to enter .ace info (but does print final 'A bientot'.)
<LI> &lt;w4/xacemain.c&gt; skip main start message, do not print
database directory, do not print wspec/datainfo.wrm, do not print
final 'A bientot'.
</UL>

<DT> ACEDB_CHANGE_MAIN_RELEASE
<DD> File: w4/session.c<br>
Use to override the message and quit-of-program you get if you try to
run a program on a database that was created with a different
version. Use with a lot of caution - main code releases 3 and 4 create
binary <B>in</B>compatible databases, so overriding will not work.

<DT> ACEDB_SUBSHELLS
<DD> File: w4/tacemain.c<br>
Set to allow subshells in tace.

<DT> ACEDB_BREAK
<DD> File: w6/bsdumps.c<br>
Controls the length of lines in ace format dumps of objects or entire
database. Default is to not break lines; if you set it to anything
that is not a valid number, then it defaults to 80 characters.

<DT> ACE2WWW
<DD> File: w6/nicedump.c<br> Turns on output (from tace)
in a format suitable for parsing &lt;???&gt;. This format probably obsolete,
replaced by ACE2PERL.

<DT> ACE2PERL
<DD> File: w6/nicedump.c<br>
Output perl objects for use
with JD's, Dougs, Sams Aceobj.pm routines.

<DT> ACEQM
<DD> File: w6/nicedump.c<br>
Quote mark for dump. Defaults to "'".

<DT> ACEDB_SERVER
<DD> File: w6/querydisp.c; wrpc/xclient.c<br>
Two different uses:
<UL>

<LI> &lt;w6/querydisp.c&gt; Specific to the IGD version: if compiled
with IGD defined the menu in the query composition window will read
'Search Locally/Search IGD/Search Server" instead of the standard
'Search'. This variable and the next (ACEDB_CLIENT) govern the last of those
commands.

<LI> &lt;wrpc/xclient.c&gt; Tells the xclient which server it should
connect to. It's an error not to set this.

</UL>

<DT> ACEDB_CLIENT
<DD> File: w6/querydisp.c<br>
See above.

<DT> ACEDB_AUTOSAVE
<DD> File: w6/querydisp.c<br>
If this variable is set, the menu item about AutoSave in the Query
window start out with 'Disable AutoSave' (i.e. it will be enabled by
default) and save all queries automatically &lt;??? just gives an
error about not finding the file?&gt;

<DT> ACEDB_PROJECT
<DD> File: w7/fmapcontrol.c; w9/embl.c
Used for two completely different things:
<UL>

<LI> &lt;w7/fmapcontrol.c&gt;: Gives slight control over if the DNA
sequence is shown or not in the Sequence display. If the variable is
<B>not</B> set <B>and</B> the sequence region to be displayed is shorter
than 1000 nt, then the DNA sequence and the coordinates are shown,
else they are hidden. &lt;This doesn't seem to be the whole truth,
is there some additional condition applied elsewhere?&gt;

<LI> &lt;w9/embl.c&gt;: governs the behaviour of the EMBL dump option
for the Sequence display. If this variable is set <B>and</B> there is
a Genomic_Canonical tag in the sequence object, the printout will
include the C.elegans specific parts of the EMBL dump (ID, DE, OS,
etc). (In fact it will do this also, irregardless of the above
condition, if the object has a cDNA tag and it's name begins with 'cm'.)

</UL>

<DT> ACEDB_CONTIG9
<DD> File: w7/pmapdisp.c; w8/pmapdisp+fp.c<br>
If set, allow editing of pMaps in the old Contig9 style.

<DT> SWDIR; PIRDIR; WORMDIR; EMBLDIR; GBDIR; PRODOMDIR; PROSITEDIR; DBDIR; SEQDBIDX; DIVTABL; SEQDB
<DD> File: w9/efetch.c; w9/fetch.c<br>
Directory location for databases and indexes to be used by efetch and
fetch. Need to end with a '/'.

<DT> GF_TABLES
<DD> File: w9/gfcode.c<br>
The directory where GeneFinder should look for it's tables. If not
set, defaults to $ACEDB/wgf.

<DT> SCF_DATA
<DD> File: wabi/basecall.c; wabi/plotseq.c<br>
The directory containing the SCF-format trace files for the assembly routines.

<DT> ACEDB_SU
<DD> <B>Obsolete</B>. Used to be needed to gain write access to the
database, in addition to having your name in the file
wspec/passwd.wrm.

<DT> AY_TRACE; AY_CACHE; AY_USER; AY_PW; ACESYBASE_TRACE
<DD> File: wrpc/acesyb.c; wrpc/acesybase.c<br>
Specific to the sybase interface. Talk to Detlef about this.
</DL>
