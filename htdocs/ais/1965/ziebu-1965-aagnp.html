A tissue culture of Arabidopsis was established from strain Estland
and has been serially subcultured five times at intervals of about 2
months. The original tissue piece, a section of hypocotyl, was grown
on a medium containing 2,4-D (3 mg/l and coconut milk (10% by volume),
as well as minerals, 2% sucrose, and 0,9% agar, with the pH adjusted
to about 5,7 before autoclaving. Subsequent cultures have been
maintained on a similar medium, with the coconut milk replaced by the
liquid in commercial, canned, sweet corn.  Growth of subcultures is
apparent to the unaided eye in 2-3 weeks; after about 2 months the
fresh weight is about 50 times that at the start.<p>

The results of one experiment are given, comparing the effects of
coconut milk and corn liquid, The tissues were weighed after 8 weeks.<p>

Other experiments suggest that at a more suitable (higher)
concentration, corn liquid may be fully as effective as coconut milk.
Dietetic corn has been used for the most part, to avoid the
complication of the NaCl ordinarily added to corn. This precaution is
probably not necessary.<p>

The mineral solution was that used by LANGRIDGE 1957), except that
iron was supplied as Sequestrene 330 Fe.  One trial using the major
minerals in the revised medium of MURASHIGE and SKOOG (1962),
indicates that this medium is little, if any, more favorable than the
other. With either mineral solution virtually no growth occurred
unless coconut milk or corn liquid were present.<p>
