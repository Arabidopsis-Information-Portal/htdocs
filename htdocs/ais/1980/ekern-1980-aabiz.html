We reported in 1972 (Corcos and Lewis) that under our laboratory
conditions the best liquid medium to grow Arabidopsis tissue culture
was one that contained Heller minerals, dextrose (20g/l), filtered V-8
juice (90 cc/l), coconut milk (120 cc/l), and 2,4-D (3 mg/l). Since
this medium contains two complex organic mixtures, we thought to
replace coconut milk by kinetin, and V-8 juice by vitamins.<p>

The replacement of coconut milk by kinetin did not seem to affect the
growth of the culture. However, the replacement of V-8 juice by
vitamins did. The growth was not as rapid (Corcos and Lewis, 1972).<p>

Pursuing our efforts to find a synthetic medium to grow Arabidopsis,
we modified the basic synthetic medium (H30), varying the amount of
glycine. H30 has the following composition per liter, Heller minerals,
20g of dextrose, 0.5mg Kinetin, 2mg of glycine, 0.5mg of Niacin, 0.1mg
of pyridoxine HCl, and 100 mg of inositol.<p>

From the results (Table 1) it seems that glycine supports root
differentiation, that nicotinic acid encourages cell multiplication,
but not root differentiation, that increasing pyridoxin HCl or
inositol inhibits cell multiplication and does not encourage root
differentiation. We are still routinely growing our cultures in H23
medium which contains filtered V-8 juice.<p>
