Arabidobsters -- don't be shocked -- this position is for work on Brachypodium distachyon. 
Universality through diversity! Thanks. TB 
 
A postdoctoral position is available to study the relation between cell wall structure and 
morphogenesis. The project uses the emerging model grass, Brachypodium distachyon, and both 
forward and reverse genetic approaches. The forward genetic approach will be a screen for 
mutants with aberrant root morphology; the reverse genetic approach will be to inactivate genes 
that are known to be important in other species. The position requires a Ph.D. in a relevant area 
of biology and preference will be given to candidates having experience with any of the following: 
developmental genetics; cell wall analysis; microscopy. The Baskin lab participates actively in the 
University of Massachusetts-Amherst Interdisciplinary Program in Plant Biology and also in a new 
cluster of scientists on campus working on B. distachyon. The University of Massachusetts is an 
Equal Opportunity Employer and I encourage all qualified persons to apply. To apply, please 
send your cv to baskin@bio.umass.edu. Check http://www.bio.umass.edu/biology/baskin/ for 
(somewhat outdated) information about my lab and feel free to contact me for more information.
