Postdoctoral Position in drought_related signaling and metabolism
Institute of Plant and Microbial Biology, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan

A postdoctoral position is available in the laboratory of Paul Verslues at the Institute 
of Plant and Microbial Biology, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.  Candidates should 
have experience in commonly used molecular biology techniques with additional 
experience in one or more of the following areas: plant stress physiology; 
biochemistry/proteomics or genetics.  Research projects for the successful applicant 
include phosphatase signaling in drought response and study of newly isolated 
mutants with deregulated expression of proline dehydrogenase, a key enzyme in 
drought response and redox buffering.

The working language of the laboratory is English and international applicants are 
encouraged to apply.  Institute staff are available to assist the successful candidate 
with the initial steps in establishing themselves in Taiwan.  The Institute of Plant and 
Microbial Biology is well equipped for plant molecular genetics and has excellent 
core facilities in proteomics, metabolomics, bioinformatics, cell biology, and gene 
expression analysis.

To apply, please send a complete CV, names and email addresses of 2_3 references, 
and a statement of research accomplishments and future goals.  Application 
materials can be submitted via email to: paulv@gate.sinica.edu.tw  Review of 
applications will begin on July 1, 2011.

Informal inquires about this position or other opportunities in the Verslues lab can 
also be made during the ICAR 2011 meeting in Madison (see poster by Badiger, G.B. 
and Verslues, P.E. in the abiotic stress responses section for additional information)
