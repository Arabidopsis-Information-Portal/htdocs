Post-doctoral Position: Carbon Flux in Developing Aspen Wood

The Ume√• Plant Science Center, Sweden, is recruiting for a post-doctoral researcher to
 join a research program studying carbon flux from phloem to developing wood in aspen. 
The project is a joint effort between the laboratories of Dr Totte Niittyl√§ at Ume√
Plant Science Centre and Prof Mark Stitt at the Max Planck Institute, Germany. The 
successful candidate is expected to divide their research time between the two locations.

The research will involve enzyme activity and metabolite measurements and isotope flux 
measurements, as well as creation and characterization of aspen mutants. Applicants 
should have a PhD in plant biology or biochemistry/chemistry and a genuine interest to 
carry out experimental plant research. Previous research experience on metabolite flux 
analysis and related analytical techniques is highly desirable. Good communication skills 
in English are a necessity. The position can begin as soon as possible, and no later than 
December 1st 2010. Funding is for 1+1 years.
