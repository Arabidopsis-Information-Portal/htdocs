The important role of herbicides in modern agiculture has led to the
development of a large number of different herbicidal compounds. The
primary target of such herbicides is often a single step in a
biochemical or physiological pathway that is not shared by animals and
may involve only a single protein (LaRossa and Falco, 1984; Arntzen
and Duesing, 1983). Recently, two chemically unrelated classes of
herbicides, the sulfonylureas and the imidazolinones, have been shown
to strongly inhibit acetohydroxy acid synthase (AHAS: Ray, 1984;
Shaner et al., 1984), an enzyme which catalyzes the first step common
to the biosynthesis of the branched-chain amino acids (Figure 1).<p>

In the case of the sulfonylureas the more extensively studied of the
two classes, a considerable amount of information on
herbicide-resistant mutants has been accumulated. Dominant mutations
that confer resistance to the sulfonylurea herbicides due to a
herbicide resistant AHAS activity in microorganisms have been shown to
map to the stuctural gene for AHAS (Yadav et al., 1986; Falco and
Dumas, 1985; LaRossa and Schloss, 1984).<p>

Mutants with analogous phenotypes have been isolated in plants for the
sulfonylurea (Arabidopsis: Haughn and Somerville, 1986, 1987;
Nicotiana tabacum: Chaleff and Ray, 1984 a and b) and for the
imidazolinone (Arabidopsis: Haughn and Somerville, 1988) herbicides.
In each case resistance was more than hundred fold greater than that
of wild type and was to single dominant nuclear mutations that result
in a herbicide resistant AHAS activity. Preliminary results have shown
that both the mutations causing sulfonylurea (csrl) and imidazolinone
(imrl) resistance in Arabidopsis map to the same locus on chromosome
three (Haughn and Somerville, unpublished results). By analogy to the
mutations causing sulfonylurea resistance in microorganisms, it seemed
likely that these loci represented mutations in an AHAS locus.
However, initially it was not possible to confirm this hypothesis
because no other mutations were known to map to the locus.<p>

The cloning of the csrl locus was of interest for two reasons. First,
it would determine if the csrl locus was a marker for a plant AHAS
gene. As will be discussed shortly such a marker would be valuable for
further genetic analysis of branched chain amino acid biosynthesis.
Second, by analogy to antibiotic resistance in microorganisms, a
herbicide resistant gene might be useful as a selectable marker in
plant molecular genetics.<p>

Recently, an AHAS gene was isolated from Arabidopsis through its
nucleic acid homology to the AHAS gene from yeast (Smith et al.,
1987). Southern blot analysis suggested that the cloned gene
represented the only such gene Arabidopsis. Using the wild type gene
as a probe, the AHAS gene was cloned from the herbicide-resistant
Arabidopsis line (Haughn et al., 1987). DNA sequence analysis showed
that the wild type gene and that from the herbicide-resistant mutant
differed by only a single base pair. The change, a G to A transition
predicting a proline to serine substitution in the amino acid
sequence, is a change identical to one found in a sulfonylurea
resistant mutant of yeast (Yadav et al., 1986).<p>

The sequence data suggested that the newly-cloned gene was csrl. To
test this hypothesis, the gene was introduced into a
herbicide-sensitive line of tobacco by Ti-mediated transformation
using Ti-encoded kanamycin resistance as a selection (Haughn et al.,
1987). Progeny of three transgenic lines were tested for sulfonylurea
resistance by transfering one week old sterile seedlings to solid agar
media containing one of a range of concentrations of the sulfonylurea
herbicide chlor-sulfuron. Results (Figure 2) indicated that like the
original sulfolylurea-resistant Arabidopsis line, the transgenic
tobacco carrying the Arabidopsis gene were over one hundred fold more
resistant to chlorsulfuron than untransformed tobacco. Further, the
transgenic plants contained chlorsulfuron resistant AHAS activity.
Taken together, these results demonstrate that the
sulfonylurea-resistant locus csrl is an allele of AHAS.<p>

The cloned csrl gene should prove to be a good selectable marker for
plant molecular genetics. The gene is dominant, and confers a high
degree of resistance at the tissue culture and the whole plant levels
in transgenic plants. The fact that tobacco is only distantly related
to Arabidopsis suggests that this gene may be useful for engineering
resistance in a wide range of crop species. Preliminary evidence
suggests that it is possible to directly select for transgenic tissue
carrying the csrl gene on the basis of resistance to chlorsulfuron.<p>

Figure 2: Chlorosulfuron resistance at the whole plant level in
progeny of untransformed (MSU223) and transgenic (GH101, GH102)
tobacco plants. Six days after germination, sterile seedlings were
transferred to petri plates containing minimal medium with the
indicated concentration of chlorosulfuron. The photograph shows a
representative sample of plants from each treatment two weeks after
transfer. Segregation of the transgenic locus resulted in the presence
of both resistant and sensitive progeny.<p>

One final point concerning the usefulness of herbicide resistance
should be mentioned. Amino acid auxotrophs have never been isolated at
the whole plant level and only a relatively small number at the level
of tissue culture (Negrutiu et al., 1985). One explanation for the
inability to isolate such mutants is that many may be gametophytic
lethals. The wild type gene and the sulfonylurea resistant Arabidopsis
could in theory be used to generate auxotrophs at the AHAS locus even
if homozygosity for a loss of function allele results in a
gametophytic lethal. One would first construct a transgenic
Arabidopsis plant homozygous for the sulfonylurea resistant allele
(Csr) at the AHAS locus and for a herbicide sensitive allele (csr) at
a transgenic locus (Figure 3A). This line could then mutagenized. Some
of the M 1 plants should have a loss of function mutation that
eliminates one of the resistant AHAS alleles (Figure 3B). Upon
segregation, some of the M 2 progeny will receive two copies of the
loss of function allele (Figure 3C) and will therefore be herbicide
sensitive.<p>

These can be isolated by identifying M 2 plants which are giving rise
to herbicide-sensitive progeny (screening M 2 lines). The problem of
gametophytic lethality will be avoided by the presence of the
functional herbicide sensitive allele at the transgenic locus. The
transgenic locus may then be crossed out of the line to determine the
phenotype of an AHAS auxotroph.<p>
