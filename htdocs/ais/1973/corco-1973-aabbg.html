Seeds of the variety Estland were treated with ethyl methanesulfonate
(10 mM, 22*degrees*C) for 16 hours.  Among the M2 seedlings, one
nutritional mutant was rescued in a complete liquid medium, asexually
propagated and tested on different solid media.  It was soon
discovered that this nutritional mutant was an amino-acid mutant which
was later identified as an arginine mutant.  It grows well in presence
of arginine, citrulline, ornithine, glutamic acid and proline.<p>
