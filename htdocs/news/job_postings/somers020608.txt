Postdoctoral position in circadian clock research 
 
An NSF-funded postdoctoral researcher position is available immediately 
to investigate the function of GIGANTEA (GI) in the context of the plant 
circadian clock (see: Kim, W.Y. et al., Nature (2007) 449: 356-360). Our 
findings have uncovered a novel link between GI, protein stability and 
robust circadian cycling. Subsequent work is now focusing on the 
biochemical and molecular basis of GI activity. Research expertise in 
molecular biology and protein biochemistry is highly desirable but prior 
plant experience is not a requirement. Candidates must have a Ph.D. in 
biochemistry, molecular biology or related fields. Interested candidates 
should send (as PDF) a cover letter accompanying a curriculum vitae, as 
well as the names of three references (preferably via email attachment) to:
