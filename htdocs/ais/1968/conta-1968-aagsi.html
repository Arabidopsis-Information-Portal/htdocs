<h2>Absence of a relation between early root growth and date of flowering in seed-irradiated Arabidopsis</h2><p>

In the experiment described by CONTANT and DANKERT (1968), root length
was measured 100 hours after germination of each of the 3453
individuals studied; subsequently, the date of first anthesis was
determined.  These plants constituted a mixture of 120 F1 families,
derived from crosses between neutron irradiated M1-individuals and
control plants. The plants were classified into 'normal' and
'extremely thin' according to their root thickness at the time of
measuring, and according to the degree of fertility ('normal', 'weak'
or 'sterile') or heavily mutated appearance. The normal appearing
plants represented approximately 90% of the total number. For each
group of plants, the correlation and regression coefficient between
rootlength and number of days to flowering is shown in the table.  All
regression coefficients were negative and very low; only those of the
severely mutated plants differed significantly from 0 (P = 0.05).
These results indicate only a very slight correspondence between
reduced root growth in the very early seedling stage and delayed
flowering.<p>

Table 1: Relation between root-length (x) and number of days to
flowering (y)<p>

The average root lengths of the different fertility groups did not
differ significantly (21 - 24 mm).  However, the roots of the heavily
mutated plants were very significantly shorter (11 mm).  The
proportion of plantlets with extremely thin roots ranged from 0.8 to
1.3% in the three fertility classes while reaching 2.8% in the heavily
mutated plants; none of the differences were significant.<p>
