	After various periods of presoaking (0 to 48 hrs) seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana (Dijon G) were treated with ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) for 1 hr. The mutagenic effect of this treatment was measured by the frequency of recessive lethal mutations (embryonic lethals and chlorophyll mutations).<p>

	It was found that the sensitivity of the shoot meristem changes considerably in the course of water inbibition and germination:<p>

	(1)  The increase of sensitivity during the imbibition phase was not influenced by anaerobic conditions. Therefore, the lower sensitivity of dry or incompletely hydrated seeds is obviously only due to the slower penetration of EMS into the meristem cells.  A first maximum of sensitivity was reached after about 5 hrs of presoaking at 24*degrees*C (or after 2 hrs at 36*degrees*C).  Prolongation of soaking under anaerobic conditions did not significantly change the sensitivity.<p>

	(2)  Under aerobic conditions which enable germination, the sensitivity decreased again and reached a minimum value after 24 to 30 hrs of soaking.  Simultaneously, the proportion of chlorophyll mutations increased from 12% to 21%.<p>

	(3)  With proceeding germination and beginning of the DNA replication in the shoot meristem, a second increase of sensitivity occurred. The sensitivity of seeds soaked for 48 hrs under aerobic conditions was found to be higher than the first maximum of sensitivity reached after 5 hrs of soaking.<p>

	A detailed publication on the subject is prepared in the "Biologisches Zentralblatt" (Supplement, 1967)<p>
