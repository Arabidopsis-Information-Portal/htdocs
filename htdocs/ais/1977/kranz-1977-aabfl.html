Introduction<p>

Two approaches to check the hypotheses of phytochrome-mediated gene
expression were discussed in recently published review articles (Mohr
1972, Smith 1976, Schopfer 1977), i) direct measuement of enzyme
inductio and enzyme repression, i.e. investigations on the level of
enzyme regulation, and 11) use of specific inhibitors of nucleic acid
or protein syntheses, i.e., studies on the level of code transcription
or translation.<p>

Usually, both experimental approaches are executed under certain
standard conditions of light treatment (continuous far-red) and
preferential standard subjects (mustard seedlings).  Since such
experimental conditions are highly selective, the general significance
of the results obtained will never be completely unambiguous and,
thus, they must be treated with considerable caution.<p>

Consequently, the use of exactly defined, monogenic and allelic
mutants showing differential phytochrome-mediated gene expression
during photomorphogenesis offers an additional approach to clarify the
principal rules of interaction between the photoactivated sensor
pigment and the gene regulation mechanism in the process of cellular
differentiation of higher plants.<p>

Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effects
interacting between 2 antimetabolites of nucleic acid and 2 inhibitors
of protein synthesis on the one hand and certain qualities of
continuous actinic light on the photoresponsive sensor pigment on the
other hand by use of 5 selected genotypes of Arabidopsis.<p>

In this study continuous light of different quality has been applied
for the following reasons.  It is generally supposed that the
proportion of the physiologicallly active form, Pfr, of the total
amount of phytochrome, Ptot, depends on the quality of the incident
light, viz. for<p>

Under continuous light condition the steady state concentration of the
effector phytochrome Pfr, however, does not depend on the wavelength
of the incident light. The prerequisite is that both phytochrome, the
Pr and the Pfr, can absorb sufficient light to establish the steady
state, as it is defined by the equation<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol14/vol14-pg48-fig2.gif">Click here for figure</a><p>

i.e., the differential change of total phytochrome (Ptot) is equal to
the difference of the rates of Pr-synthesis (ks) and Pfr-destruction
(kd).<p>

EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS<p>

Material: Seed samples were received from AIS-seedbank, Frankfurt/Main
as numbered,<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol14/vol14-pg49-fig1.gif">Click here for figure</a><p>

Seedlings of A. thaliana (L.) Heynh. were studied at the age of 9 to
11 days<p>

Germination: The seeds were surface-sterilized for 15 min. in chlorine
HC1 granulate (5.7 p.c. aqueous solution), photoinduced by 15 min.
far-red and then 15 min. red light, and, finally, vernalized by 22
hrs. of 3 +/- 1*degree*C after incorporation in the aseptic medium.<p>

Culture: was performed on standard-agar medium according t Redei
(1965) plus 1 x 10E-6 M IAA and caseinhydrolisate (lg per liter).
Temperature of the growth chamber was adjusted to 26 +/- 2*degrees*C.
Seedlings were treated continuously by different qualities of actinic
light and by inhibitor substances for 10 +/- 1 days after gemination
as follows,<p>

Measurements: Hypocotyl length was estimated by use of a
Zeiss-stereomicroscope; plastidal pigments were measured in total
extracts of acetone 80 p.e. according to Kranz (1971) using the Zeiss
PMQ II spectrophotometer. Values are the mean +/- standard deviation
of 2 separate experiments carried out mostly in more than 2
replications.<p>

RESULTS<p>

Experimental data obtained are demonstrated separately next to the
light and the inhibitor treatments.  Table 1 shows that under
continuous FR-light the seed germination as well as the amount of
plastidal pigments of all the genotypes studied decreases in
comparison to R- and B-light; however, continuous R-light induces
significantly higher hypocotyl lengthening of the 5 genotypes.
Therefore, the operational criterion for the involvement of
phytochrome and probably of a blue sensitive chromoproteid in the 5
photoresponses is fulfilled. Further, on an average cycloheximide
which suppresses the function of the 60S cytoplasmic ribosomes
inhibits their manifestation more than the other substances (Table 2);
although, there are certain deviations showing that the effectiveness
of the inhibitors depend on the genotype. Evidently, the experimental
treatments involve their variable gene expressions.<p>

Furthermore, pure light effects show in detail (Table 1) that i) the
seed germination decreases under FR-treatment relative to the control
(W) in all the genotypes tested, and to a lower extent in im52 and
im247 under R- or B-treatment, ii) the hypocotyl length increases
under all the light regimes studied relative to control (W) in the
genotypes except the mutant im 247 where R only promotes, and FR and B
inhibit to a certain extent, and iii) the amount of plastid pigments
decreases in the genotypes especially under FR except in im52 where FR
and B increases the pigment amount to about 200 p.c.  This blue light
sensitivity of im52 was demonstrated for the first time by Robbelen
(1968).<p>

The summarizing of the light effects shows specific and unusual
photomorphogenesis of the 2 allelic mutants im52 and im247.<p>

Detailed inhibitor effects presented in Table 2 show that i) the seed
germination is inhibited by CH in all the genotypes tested, and also
by 6-AU only relative to control (H2O) in im52, ii) the hypocotyl
length increases in the wildtype (+) and decreases in the mutant ch2
by all the inhibitors substances; effects are rather variable in the
other genotypes, i.e. promoting and reducing were observed depending
on both the inhibitor and the genotype, and iii) the chlorophylls and
the carotenoids are reduced by all the inhibitors in +/- and im52, and
CH inhibits in the genotypes very strongly relative to control.
However, 6-AU suppresses the pigment amount in ch2, but promotes the
amount very strongly in im28 and in im247.  The 6-AU sensitivity of
the last mutant confirms the earlier findings of Redei et al.  (1974).
The summarizing of the results of the inhibitor treatments clearly
demonstrates the specific effect of 6-AU in certain genotypes.<p>

Interaction between the light and the inhibitor effects, although
studied in every combination, are shown here only for the most
significant effects in the im-mutants (Figure 1).  In im28, however,
there is no interaction between the photoresponses mediated by R-,
FR-, or &#158;-light and the simultaneous treatment with the 4 inhibitor
substances in the seed germination.  On the other hand the pronounced
effect of R on hypocotyl lengthening of im247 to about 400 p.c. of the
control (W) can be reduced by CH and 6-AU; however, LM is ineffective
under these conditions. Further, the effect of FR and B (both not
different to control) is reduced by AM.D. and by CH, the later in FR
only. Evidently, the strong influence of B on chlorophyll a of the
im52-seedlings (about 350 p.c. of control) is promoted by treating
this mutant with 6-AU; however, the B-effect is reduced to the
wildtype level by AM.D and CH.  Otherwise no effect of this kind has
been obtained by FR and R. Summarizing these results we may conclude
that the role of the R- or B-sensitive effector pigment on gene
expression of im247 or im52 can be suppressed or promoted during
photomorphogenesis by certain inhibitors of nucleic acid metabolism
(6-AU, AM.D) and of protein synthesis (CH). Furthermore, no
significant interaction between FR and inhibitors could be found in
seed germination; and last not least the gene expression mediated by
the photomorphogenetically effective sensor pigments is not affected
by LM, a specific inhibitor of plastidal ribosomes.<p>

DISCUSSION<p>

Recently, differential effect of red light on the nucleic acid
biosynthesis in Pisum cells was shown by Konjevic et al.  (1976).
Certain attention has been focused on the phytochrome controlled acid
RNase and its attachment to ribosomes (Acton 1974).  Operationally
continuous far-red light stimulates via phytochrome the accumulation
of cytoplasmic and plastidal rRNA in mustard seedlings (Thien and
Schopfer 1975a) and it has been suggested that phytochrome is able to
activate transcription of rRNA cistrons (Thien and Schopfer 1975b).
Thus the interaction of CH and R on hypocotyl lengthening in im247 can
be interpreted by differential activation of rRNA transcription.
EM-studies of our group now underway will probably show
ultrastructural aberrations in the ribosomal machinery, which have
been influenced by the interaction of light and inhibitor treatments.
As it was shown by Chung et al.  (1974) three enzymes all involved in
the de novo synthesis of pyrimidines or in the degradation of RNA are
overpruduced in the cells of homozygous im genotypes when the mutation
is expressed.  In plants grown on 6-AU media the level of RNase
returns to near normal, 05 PPase is reduced below normal while the
amount of 05PPase and inhibition of 05 PDase's activity causes the
reduction of the flow of metabolites through the de novo pyrimidine
synthesis. Thus, we may conclude that during protomorphogenesis of the
im-plastids the reduction of the RNase to normal level, the repression
of 05 PPase, and the derepression of 05 PDase will probably be
involved in the B-effect of 6-AU in im52.  That means that
photomorphogenetic effector, Pfr or the activated blue chromoprotein
(Briggs 1977), could be related to a certain gene (im52)-controlled
enzyme regulation of nucleic acids as well as cytoplasmic protein
synthesis.  Since, under treatment with B there is no relation of this
kind in im247, an allelic mutant of this locus controlling
differential variegation, the hypocotyl length promoted by R can be
reduced significantly by 6-AU and CH, we suggest that a differential
photosensor mediated gene expression is realized in im247.<p>

Two control mechanisms, viz. photomodulation and photodetermination,
have been discussed in respect to the Pfr-mediated increase in enzyme
activity (Schopfer 1973, Sharma et al., 1976).  In photomodulation the
photoresponse on enzyme regulation depends upon the continuous
presence of Pfr, wherease in photodetermination the response once
tiggered by Pfr will continue even in its absence.  In this study we
have presented data which show that although photomodulation is
involved, the relative low, high, and the medium level of Pfr
established under steady state conditions of FR-, R-, and
B-irradiation, respectively, will regulate differential gene
expressions of a single gene locus depending on this allelic
condition. The main assumption of earlier phytochromes research that
photomorphogenesis starts by a single primary reaction (switch on and
off) of the effector Pfr is not justified (Mohr 1977).  Instead, the
steady state condition of the photosensitive pigment systems(s)
directly participates in differential gene expression.<p>
