Sucrose metabolism is of fundamental importance to all plants, but
thus far the literature, although extensive, provides little evidence
on the genetics of the system. Due to the ability of Arabidopsis to
grow on defined media supplemented with sucrose or glucose, it is the
ideal plant in which to investigate the biochemistry and genetics of
invertase production. We are currently trying to isolate mutants using
a screening test based on their inability to hydrolyse sucrose.<p>

EMS-treated seeds of the race Est are sown in soil and the M2 seed are
harvested. Seeds are sterilised in a 1:1 mixture of EtOH and H202 (20
vols) and washed several times with sterile water before being sown
aseptically in single rows on 0.75% agar containing 0.1% KNO3 in petri
plates. After 4 days at 4*degrees*C to ensure uniform germination, the
plates are transferred to a growth cabinet (continuous light, 10.000
lux, 25*degrees*C) for another 4-5 days. During the growth period the
plates stand at an angle of 60*degrees* so that the seedlings are
regularly orientated and their roots remain on the surface of the agar
(CONTANT 1966).<p>

The screening procedure, based on LEPESANT, KUNST, LEPESANT-KEJZLAROVA
and DEDONDER (1972) is as follows: Using a sterile all-glass handspray
(Quickfit) connected to an air-line with microbial filter
incorporated, the row of seedlings on each plate is sprayed with a 50%
solution of especially pure sucrose (Aristar) which was previously
sterilised by ultrafiltration. Glucostat Special reagent (Worthington)
is made up by dissolving the contents of an enzyme vial and a
chromogen vial in 8 ml of sterile distilled water each and then mixing
the two solutions.  The seedlings are sprayed with this reagent 15
minutes after the addition of sucrose and the plates are subsequently
placed in the dark at 25*degrees*C for 1 hour before scoring under a
binocular microscope.<p>

Due to the photosensitivity of the reagent the entire sprayed region
developes a faint pink hue, but specific regions around the seedling
show a much deeper red colour than the background, indicating areas of
high surface invertase activity. These are at the root tip, around the
cotyledons and to a lesser extent at the junction of the hypocotyl and
root (see Figure 1).<p>

Individual seedlings which lack these three "spots" are picked out and
transplanted aseptically into a mineral medium supplemented with 2%
glucose and solidified with 0.8% agar.  Such putative "null-enzyme"
mutants survive for a long time (over 4 months), but their rosettes
remain very small and do not develop inflorescences before they
ultimately die.  On the other hand wild-type seedlings which have
undergone the same screening procedures grow normally and produce
fertile inflorescences.<p>

As these mutants have proved sterile our present efforts are being
directed towards the isolation of heterozygotes from individual M2
families for further genetic studies. We are also trying to establish
callus lines form the mutants as we believe that the genotypes are
more likely to survive in the undifferentiated state and it should be
possible to collect sufficient callus tissue for biochemical studies.<p>
