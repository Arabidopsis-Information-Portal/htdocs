<h2>THE FREE AMINO ACID POOL IN MUTANT A-154</h2><p>

The extreme sensitivity of the Arabidopsis mutant A-154 to amino acids
(Acedo and Redei, 1976) prompted us to look for any difference in
quality and/or quantity of amino acids present in the mutant and wild
type. The free amino acid pool was expected to show such a difference.<p>

Plants grown aseptically on defined media were extracted in 80 percent
ethyl alcohol, clarified by centrifugation and desalted according to
the method of Harris et al. (1961). The extract, acidified to pH 2.5 -
3 with 8N acetic acid, was passed through Dowex 50W (X8-400) in the
H-form. Pasteur pipettes were conveniently used as columns for the
resin. The amino acids were eluted from the column with 2N
triethylamine in 20 percent acetone. Almost all the total amino acid
content was collected in the first 1 ml fraction. The eluates were
concentrated in a small porcelain crucible lined with silicon
lubricant. The concentrated amino acid samples were chromatographed on
MN-cellulose plates. The solvent system used consisted of butanol:
acetic acid: water (BAW, 9:1:2.5 V/V) for the first dimension and
phenol: water (PW, 8:3 V/V) for the second dimension (Thompson, 1959.
With BAW alone, almost all the amino acids can be resolved after a
2-hour development in the same solvent for 3 times. The technique is
fast and simple and is useful for routine amino acid determination
where an amino acid analyzer is not available. The amino acids on the
plates were detected with ninhydrin spray.<p>

Figure 1 shows a 1-dimensional chromatogram of the mutant and the wild
type; figure 2 shows the 2-dimensional chromatogram. Both figures
indicate that 1 amino acid in A-154 is missing or may be present in
very low concentration. This spot corresponds to glutamic acid.
Quantitative analysis of the extracts by column chromatography (Benson
and Patterson, 1971) showed that glutamic acid is indeed present in
considerably lower amount than the wild type.<p>

acid.<p>

Glutamic acid occupies a key role in amino acid metabolism, so, a
shortage or imbalance in its biosynthesis will be reflected in the
quantity of the other amino acids. However, the reduced amount of
amino acids in A-154 may be just secondary to a malfunction in the
regulation of enzyme(s) involved in amino acid metabolism or other
related biochemical function.<p>
