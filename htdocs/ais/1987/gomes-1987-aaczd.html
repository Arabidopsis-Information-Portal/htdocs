INTRODUCTION<p>

Electrophoretic analysis of enzyme polymorphisms in natural
populations of Arabidopsis thaliana is currently limited to a single
report by Fuglewicz and Kilian (1985) concerning variation within 18
populations from Poland for 8 enzyme systems. Here we report the
results of a survey of electrophoretic variation in 16 British
populations of A. thaliana for 9 enzyme systems. We describe the
levels of single locus and multilocus genotypic diversity found in
these populations and show that reasonable amounts of genotypic
diversity regularly occur within and between populations in Britain.<p>

MATERIAL AND METHODS<p>

Seed was collected from 30 individual plants from each of 11
populations located in Derbyshire, England, and 5 populations from
Scotland. Electrophoresis was conducted in 12.5% starch gels on enzyme
extracts from rosette leaves of 4 week old plants. Plants were grown
from seed in a greenhouse and 3 offspring were examined per individual
to determine maternal genotype (Brown, 1975). Electrophoresis was
performed using standard procedures (Ferguson, 1980). The composition
of gel and electrode buffers for acid phosphatase, AP; esterase, EST:
phosphoglucoisomerase, PGI; and peroxidase, PEP, followed the recipes
of Scandalios (1969) and for phosphoglucomutase, PGM; glutamate-oxalo
acetate transaminase, GOT; malic dehydrogenase, MDH; glutamate
dehydrogenase, GDH; and isocitrate dehydrogenase, IDH, followed those
of Adams and Joly (1980). Methods of staining were the same as or
slight modifications of standard ones: AP, PGI - modified from
Gottliebe (1973); EST - modified from Scandalios (1969); Per - Shaw
and Prasad (1970); GDH - Brewer and Sing (1970); PGM, GOT, MDH, IDH -
Adams and Joly (1980).<p>

RESULTS<p>

Figure 1 shows the electrophoretic variants that were resolved for
each enzyme system apart from AP. Resolution of AP activity was
equivalent to that reported by Jacobs and Schwind (1976) with
variation occurring at 3 clearly distinguished loci AP1, AP2 and AP3.
Gels stained for EST were multi-banded (see Fuglewicz and Kilian,
1985), however, variation was confined to only 2 zones of activity.
Grover (1975) has shown that variation in each of these 2 zones is due
to allelic variation at single loci. A genetic analysis of the fast
and slow variants for each of IDH and PER revealed single locus
control with codominant alleles at each locus. IDH produced a 3 banded
phenotype in the heterozygote and therefore can be considered as
dimeric. A genetic analysis of the variants for PGM1 and PGM2 has yet
to be conducted, however, the variants appear to be under the control
of codominant alleles at 2 distinct loci. The banding patterns for
GOT, GDH, MDH and PGI were monomorphic over all populations surveyed.<p>

patterns for 4 monomorphic enzyme systems in A. thaliana. S, I and F
refer to slow, intermediate and fast alleles at each locus.<p>

Table 1 lists the genotype frequencies at each polymorphic locus over
all English and Scottish populations, and all populations combined.
Out of a total of 480 parent plants tested only 2 heterozygotes were
detected. These were for the F and I alleles at the AP1 locus in one
Scottish population. Null alleles were recorded at the AP2 locus
(rare) and both EST loci. For AP1 and AP2 a single genotype tended to
predominate over all populations surveyed. This was also the case for
IDH, PGM1 and PGM2 where for each locus only 1 of 16 populations was
polymorphic. Polymorphism was far more extensive at the AP3, EST1,
EST2 and PER loci.<p>

Table 1: Genotype frequencies at 9 polymorphic loci<p>

From the allelic variation resolved at the 9 polymorphic loci it is
possible to construct 874,800 theoretical multilocus genotypes. Among
the sample of 480 plants screened, 47 different multilocus genotypes
were uncovered (0.098 genotypes per individual). The number of
genotypes ranged from 1-8 per population with a mean of 4.75. The
distribution of genotypes per population was relatively even (Figure
2a) with only 2 populations composed of a single genotype. The number
of populations per genotype was highly skewed (Figure 2b) with the
majority of genotypes (30) limited in distribution to a single
population. One genotype, however, occured in 6 of the 16 populations
surveyed.<p>

To obtain a measure of multilocus genotypic diversity in each
population Pielou's corrected version of the Gini Index (D) was
calculated:
 
D = 1 - *sigma* [ni(ni-1)]/[N(N-1)]<p>

where ni is the number of individuals of genotype i and N is the total
sample size. This index of heterogeneity takes into account both the
number of genotypes present and the evenness with which they are
distributed in a sample (PEET, 1974). (D) may range from 0 (a uniform
sample) to 1 ( a completely heterogeneous sample). The values for
the 16 populations surveyed are illustrated in Figure 3. They range
from 0.00 to 0.83, mean = 0.55).<p>

CONCLUSION AND SUMMARY<p>

It is evident from the results of this study that considerable
genotypic diversity is present both within and between British
populations of A. thaliana. A more extensive survey of a wider range
of enzyme systems plus a variety of morphological and phenological
traits (see Jones, 1971; Cetl, 1978) would very likely increase the
levels of genotypic diversity detected. It is concluded that
significant levels of electrophoretic variation persist in many
British populations of A. thaliana despite the low outcrossing rates
exhibited by the species in the wild (Snape and Lawrence, 1971).<p>
