RIKEN Plant Science Center
Research Associate and Postdoctoral Fellow in the Growth Regulation Research Team

Opportunity for Research at RIKEN Plant Science Center in Japan

This team will develop a comprehensive, high-throughput hormone analysis system to study 
localization and transport of  plant hormones. Candidates for one research associate and one 
postdoctoral fellow are searched. The successful candidate for both positions will hold a PhD degree 
(obtained within the past three years for the research associate), have research experience in 
plant biology, and be familiar with plant hormone biochemistry and analysis. We seek highly 
motivated scientists in conducting interdisciplinary research on plant hormones in cooperation 
with other lab members.

Research theme:

*    Development of a new comprehensive plant hormone analysis system using GC-MS and LC-MS.
*    Study on localization and transport of plant hormones in plants.
*    Isoprenoid biosynthesis in plants (especially in plastids) using labeled intermediates of 
MEP and MVA pathways.

Besides Research Associates who directly belong to the team and are to be engaged in specific 
projects above, independently proposed themes related to our theme will be also considered. 
It is recommended that candidates apply for JSPS (for foreigners http://www.jsps.go.jp/english/index.html 
or Japanese
http://www.jsps.go.jp/j-pd/main.htm) or RIKEN Special Postdoctoral Researcher (SPR; for Japanese
