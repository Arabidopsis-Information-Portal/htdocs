The use of plant tissue cultures in studies of mutation and selection
is attractive because one can manipulate in a confined place, a large
population of haploid or diploid cells which can regenerate into whole
plants.  This is a clear advantage over the use of plants in field
experiments or in the greenhouse.<p>

The isolation of mutant cells was first reported in 1970 (Carlson,
1970; Binding, et al., 1970; Heimer and Filner, 1970).  This generated
a lot of interest and within a few years resulted in the selection of
a wide spectrum of variant cell lines in various species.<p>

Discussion of the results will be limited here to the problem of
classifying new cell lines as mutant, after recovery from tissue
culture. For those interested in other aspects, they are referred to
the original papers and recent reviews (Binding, 1974; Carlson, et
al., 1973; Chaleff and Carlson, 1974; Maliga, 1976; Rice and Carlson,
1975; Street, 1975; Wildom, 1974; Zenk, 1974)<p>

Criteria for the classification of a phenotype as mutant<p>

Mutations are defined as permanent hereditary changes in the primary
structure of DNA. They generally result in a phenotypic change.
Phenotypic alterations, however, may also arise as a consequence of,
for example, changes in gene expression.  Phenotypic changes due to
any cause other than mutation are called epigenetic (Nanney, 1958;
Siminovitsch, 1976).<p>

In cell cultures the most satisfactory criterion for the
classification of new variants is based on the regeneration of fertile
plants from the variant cell lines.  If the transmission of the
variant trait in sexual crosses conforms to classical genetics or if
the trait is inherited from one parent only, as in the case of
cytoplasmic inheritance, the variant phenotype must result from
mutation. Further evidence for mutation can be provided by
establishing linkage relationships with well defined genetic markers.
Using these criteria, the term mutation covers any basic change,
deletion, or rearrangement in the DNA of the chromosome or organelle.
Chromosome mutations, e.g., inversions or translocations, are also
included, since they are also inherited.  However, aneuploidy or
polyploidy are not included.<p>

When plants cannot be obtained from the variant cells, or when the
plants are sterile, other criteria have to be used to classify
variants.  Demonstration of the presence of an altered gene product in
the variant cells, e.g., of an enzyme with an altered amino acid
sequence, can be accepted as proof of mutation.  Indirect evidence of
this type has been provided by Widholm, who demonstrated the altered
feedback sensitivity of the anthranilate synthetase enzyme to
5-methyltryptophan in carrot (Widholdm, 1972) and tobacco (Widholm,
1972) cell lines, resistant to this analog.<p>

Some other criteria which have been used as evidence for mutation are
unsatisfactory.  These include stability of the variant phenotype in
the absence of the selective pressure, low frequency of variants, and
retention of the variant trait by regenerated plants.  These criteria
have been recently discussed in detail (Maliga, 1976).<p>

The underlying nature of phenotypic variation has been clarified in
only a small number of cell lines. Following is a brief duscussion of
this.<p>

Mutants isolated from plant tissue culture<p>

The first paper to report isolation of a mutant cell line was
Carlson's in 1973, working with methionine-sulphoximine-resistance in
Nicotania tabacum.  From a preliminary study of F1 and F2 between
resistant and nonresistant lines, Carlson concluded that resistance
was due to one or two pairs of genes segregating independently.  Since
then, bromodeoxyuridine (&#158;UdR) resistance in a Nicotania tabacum
cell line, BR23, was shown to be also under nuclear control (Marton
and Maliga, 1975), since BUdR resistance was transmitted by R23 plants
used as males as well as female parents in all the crosses.<p>

On the other hand, streptomycin resistance is due to a cytoplasmic
mutation.  Complete genetic analysis of a stremptomycin-resistant
Nicotania tabacum line has been accomplished (Maliga, 1973; Maliga,
1975).  Data from F1, F2, and backcrosses were all consistant with the
idea that stremptomycin-resistance was due to a cytoplasmic mutation,
since in all cases the phenotype of the progeny was identical with the
phenotype of the female plant.<p>

Epigenetic variants.<p>

One example of an epigenetic variant from our laboratory is CR 4/6, a
cycloheximide-resistant Nicotiana tabacum cell line. Resistance of
this line is based on the potentiality of the cells to convert
cycloheximide into a biologically inactive form.  Resistance, however,
is maintained only as long as callus is grown on a
cycloheximide-containing medium, and is associated with differentiated
cultures. Resistance is believed to be due to the activation of a gene
or genes normally not expressed in callus cultures.<p>

Until now cell lines representing at least twenty-three different new
phenotypes have been described (Table 1).  The initial successes
indicate that tissue culture can be used to isolate a variety of
biochemical mutants which can subsequently be applied to genetic and
physiological problems.<p>

The isolation of the first variants in tissue cultures of Arabidopsis
is reported by Negrutiu and Jacobs in this volume.  This variant
isolation was important because Arabidopsis has been shown to be an
excellent test plant for genetic studies (Redei, this volume) and
undoubtedly will become a model for plant cell genetics.<p>
