PhD graduate assistantship on molecular biology and biochemistry of plant-pathogen 
interactions

A PhD graduate assistantship in Applied Bioscience is available at Zeng laboratory in the 
Biology Department of University of Arkansas at Little Rock (UALR).  This studentship 
has financial support for at least 4 years and the earliest admission time will be the Fall 
semester of 2012.  Research in Zeng laboratory focuses on the roles of ubiquitination in 
the regulation of plant-microbe interactions with an emphasis on non-classical 
ubiquitination.  It utilizes tomato and rice as model system to identify key mechanisms 
underlying plant immunity against bacterial and fungal pathogen infections.  For more 
information, please visit http://ualr.edu/biology/.  Successful candidates should be highly 
motivated and have a good record in their undergraduate and/or Master degree study.  
Applicants with any of the following qualifications will be highly desirable: (1) Has 
experience in the study of plant-microbe interactions; (2) Has background in molecular 
biology and biotechnology; (3) Has good technical writing skills; and (4) hold a Master's 
degree or equivalence in plant biology-related disciplines.  Qualified applicants should
send a cover letter, academic transcripts from relevant undergraduate and/or graduate
(Master) study, TOEFL (international applicants) and GRE scores, and a CV containing 
contact information of two academic references to Dr. Zeng via email (lxzeng@ualr.edu). 
Please use "Ph.D. graduate assistantship" as the subject for the email message.
