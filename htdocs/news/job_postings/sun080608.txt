POSTDOCTORAL POSITION: Gibberellin Signaling in Arabidopsis
Department of Biology, Duke University

A postdoctoral position is available immediately to study "Gibberellin Signaling in 
Arabidopsis."  We are looking for a highly
motivated individual who has an excellent background in protein chemistry, genetics, 
genomics, molecular biology or plant development.

Bioactive gibberellins (GAs) are a class of plant hormones that modulate diverse 
developmental processes throughout the life cycle of a plant.  The nuclear DELLA 
proteins are highly conserved negative regulators of GA signaling that act immediately 
downstream of the GA receptors GID1 to repress GA-mediated growth in Arabidopsis 
and in a number of crops.  GA signal appears to de-repress its response pathway by 
triggering degradation of these repressor proteins.  To understand how GA controls plant 
development, we are using biochemical and genomics approaches to elucidate the 
signaling events immediately downstream of DELLA.
