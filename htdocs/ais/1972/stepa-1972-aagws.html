Investigation of the influence of different irradiation doses on the
plant development requires a complex appplication of statistical
parameters.  The aim of this paper is to study the influence of
gamma-rays in the doses 10, 30 and 60 kR with the rate 3. 103 R/min on
the following characters of Arabidopsis thaliana plants: 1-the
appearance of seminal leaves, 2-appearance of a rosette, 3-the
beginning of buttoning, 4-the beginning of flowering, 5-the number of
siliques on the main stem, 6-height to the first silique, 7-the number
of side shoots.<p>

As can be seen from Table 1, with the increase of the gamma-ray dose,
the dates of the development phases occur with some delay.  The range
of ontogenetical variability of the last three phases (2, 3, 4)
increases at the 30 and 60 kR dose of irradiation.  In the paper by
FERSHTAT et al. (1971) a close correlation of the development phases
of Arabidopsis plants was demonstrated, forming a correlation galaxy.
In Table 2 the correlation matrixes of the development phases of
Arabidopsis plants grown from the irradiated seeds are given.  No
reliable correlations of the development phases with characters 5, 6
and 7 and between 5,6 and 7 as well, were observed: Irradiation of 10
kR delayed insignificanctly the occurrence of the development phases,
breaking at the same time the development phase correlations.
Irradiations with 30 and 60 kR delayed all the development phases
without violating the phase displacement conjugation.<p>

It is not always possible to describe various factors influencing
quantitative characters of plants in populations by the usually
applied statistical parameters.  On the basis of the
discrimination function (KALININ, 1969) some measure is introduced,
characterizing the radiation influence on the investigated
quantitative character.  Let us introduce some "fictious" variable so
as on the individuals of an unirradiated population it would take the
values of 0, and on those of irradiated population = 1.  Then the
correlation coefficient of the investigated quantitative character
with a fictious variable, the discriminating coefficient, will show
the degree of population response on radiation.<p>

Table 3: Discriminating coefficients of control and irradiated
populations for the investigated quantitative characters of
Arabidopsis thaliana<p>

The application of discriminating coefficients makes it possible to
take into account both the difference in the mean values and the
dispersion ratio of control and irradiated populations, which allows
to display the action of the factor when there are no reliable
differences in the means. The analysis of discriminations shows that
the most radiation-sensitive character is the time of the rosette
appearance.  The application of discriminating coefficients allows to
estimate the influence of irradiation in the doses of 10 and 30 kR for
the buttoning and flowering phases.<p>
