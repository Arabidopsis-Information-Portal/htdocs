Postdoctoral opportunities at the University of Illinois 
 
There are two postdoctoral positions available associated with a five-year research award from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to the University of Illinois. 
 
The project is entitled RIPE - Realizing Increased Photosynthetic Efficiency. The goal of the research is to improve the photosynthetic properties of key food crops, particularly rice and cassava. Increasing photosynthetic efficiency has not yet been addressed by conventional breeding methods, though it has the potential to increase yields and increase efficiency of water and nitrogen use. Project team members will apply recent advances in photosynthesis research and crop bioengineering in RIPE. In addition, computer simulation models of the highly complex photosynthetic system, from metabolic networks to field crop biophysics, combined with practical engineering, will identify the best targets for improving photosynthesis efficiency. 
 
Prospective candidates need a PhD in plant biology, plant genetics, plant biotechnology or a closely related discipline. Demonstrated skills in one or more of the following areas of photosynthesis research is required: molecular biology and genetics, plant transformation, leaf gas exchange or field crop photosynthetic phenotyping. A strong background in photosynthesis, good oral and written communication skills coupled with the ability to work independently and cooperatively are strongly preferred. Because this position is with the USDA/ARS, candidates must be US citizens or hold a permanent residency card. 
 
The starting salary is ~$57,400 and we would like to fill these positions as soon as possible but would delay the start date for highly qualified candidates. Interested candidates should e-mail their application letter, full cv and names of three references to Don Ort (d-ort@igb.illinois.edu). We will begin review of candidates on May 15 but will accept applications until the positions are filled.
