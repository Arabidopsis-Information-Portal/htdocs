The study of linkage between two different recessive mutant alleles is
difficult because they are in repulsion; for this reason, double
mutants are not available so that an analytical back-crossing is
impossible. The detection of linkage in the F2 is also disadvantageous
(HIRONO and REDEI, 1964; McKELVIE, 1965).  In addition, further
difficulties arise if lethel genes should be localised.  In
Arabidopsis, however, this disadvantage turns into preference if we
have to do with embryonic and chlorophyll lethal genes which can be
detected by means of a MULLER's "Embryonentest"(MULLER, 1963).  In
this case, we can estimate relatively easily, quickly and reliably the
linkage relations between embryonic or chlorophyll lethal alleles and
any marker gene (for Arabidopsis see, f.i., REDEI, 1965). Provided we
have these markers in each linkage group, we can estimate the
appurtenance of various embryonic and chlorophyll lethal genes into
linkage groups, and its distance from the marked locus, respectively.<p>

Our method is based on the MULLER's "Embryonentest".  On the stigmata
of the marker a (a ch+/a ch+) pollen of a plant hetrozygous for the
lethal mutation (a+ch+/a+ch) is brought.  In F1 the double
heterozygotes (a+ch/a ch+) are crossed with the markers.<p>

In B1, two externally different groups are obtained: phenotypically
standard plants (a+ch+/a ch+) and (a+ch/a ch+) and the plants with the
marker phenotype (a ch+/a ch+) and (a ch/a ch+).<p>

Using the embryo test, it is possible to determine all four genotypes
within both given groups.<p>

If independent combination takes place, these genotypes occur in a
1:1:1:1: ratio, while the increased frequency of the second and third
class indicates the linkage.<p>

This method has some advantages in Arabidopsis: (1) The information
about linkage is gathered from the B1 instead of the F2.  (2) The
non-analytical procedure is made analytical owing to MULLER's
"Embryonentest". (3) In the parental generation, emasculation is not
necessary provided that the marker genotype is used as mother so that
all standard F1 plants are hybrid.  (4) If, on the contrary, ebryonic
and chlorophyll lethals will be used as markers for each group, the
localization of any visible mutant recessive allele will be equally
easy.<p>

The given method was successfully used in a series of recessive
chlorophyll lethal mutations. Several chlorophyll lethals were
localized into the first and third linkage group.<p>

In the near future, it is necessary to construct special genotypes
enabling us to map particular chromosomes.<p>
