Steingrover and Feenstra (1981) reported the isolation of a number of
mutants, resistant to low concentrations of chlorate when grown on
ammonia as the sole nitrogen source. Scholten et al. (1982)
demonstrated that a mutant cell line (GI), established from a chlorate
resistant seed from the F 2 of one of these mutants and wildtype, is
able to assemble a complete nitrate reductase enzyme but that electron
transfer by the co-factor has stopped, the mutant thus being a
cofactor (cnx-type) mutant. Crosses were made between G1 plants and
two other cofactor mutants (B25 and B73) isolated as M2-seedlings by
Braaksma and Feenstra (1982). G1 appeared to be not allelic with B25
and B73.<p>

Bright et al. (1983) described a conditional-lethal cnx-type nitrate
reductase-deficient mutant of barley, which could only be maintained
in liquid culture. Since G1-plants show the same dependence on
conditions of high humidity for growth to maturity, this phenomenon
may be a common feature of cnx-mutants. To study the physiological
base of the wilting process, silicone impressions of leaves of
wildtype and G1 were made to compare stomatal behaviour at increasing
water stress. When the relative humidity decreased, wildtype stomata
closed almost completely within two hours whereas even after six hours
most of the G1 stomata remained open despite severe symptoms of
wilting.<p>

Steingrover and Feenstra (1981) already reported that the majority of
the mutants, isolated in the above described way, die upon
transplantation into soil. Scholten et al. (1982) mentioned that
mutant cell lines could be established from seeds. In order to obtain
a number of such lines, M 2-seedlings were screened for chlorate
resistance as described by Steingrover and Feenstra (1981). Each lot
of about 150 M 2 seeds sown originated from 6 M 1 plants. Reserve
seeds of those batches of M 2 seeds from which resistant plants had
emerged were sown on a selective medium (10 mM NaC10 3) inducing
callus growth on just emerging, resistant seedlings. This procedure
restricted the need for seed sterilisation to those M 2 groups in
which mutants could be expected. The selective medium was a modified
Murashige and Skoog medium and contained glutamine, aspartic acid,
arginine and glycine as N-sources and 2, 4-D, kinetine and GA 3 as
phytohormones.<p>

Not in all cases, in which resistant plants had been found, resistant
calli were obtained (which might be a matter of chance), however, 16
cell lines could be isolated, each originating from a different M 2
group, and thus due to independent mutational events.<p>

It was found previously that wildtype (=Ecotype Landsberg (Missouri),
mutant erecta) callus only has measurable activities of nitrate
reductase (NaR) and xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) when showing good
growth. Seven out of 16 cell lines showed such good growth that
activity tests should give reliable results. Six out of these 7 lines
showed neither NaR, nor XDH activity, indicating that they are
cnx-mutants, like mutant G1.<p>

Plants selected as resistant seedlings from the M 2 groups which had
produced the cell lines, all died in an early stage of development,
again suggesting that zero-activity cnx-type mutants are lethal in the
plant stage. The question whether all our mutant cell lines carry a
mutation in the same gene will have to be answered by somatic
hybridization (cf. Marton, et al., 1982).<p>

From a batch of M 2 seeds both a cell line (G42-155) and some
resistant plants were isolated, the latter, upon transplantation into
soil, showing rather normal growth and yielding seeds. Preliminary
experiments indicated that callus of this line, when grown on a medium
with amino acids as the nitrogen source, possesses levels of nitrate
reductase activity comparable to or even higher than wildtype. In
accordance with this result, the XDH activity also appeared normal. M
3-seedlings on a medium with nitrate as the sole nitrogen source
remained very small and died after the first two rosette leaves had
appeared, or earlier. Plants grown on ammonium nitrate had partly
yellow leaves and showed a less vigorous growth than plants grown on
ammonium sulphate.<p>

These data might suggest that we are dealing with an uptake mutant;
however, callus, when grown on nitrate containing medium contains a
considerable amount of nitrate, comparable to the nitrate content of
wildtype callus.<p>

Before further studies, aimed at explaining the seemingly
contradictory results, can be carried out, it must be established that
cell line and plants harbour the same mutation. Given their origin it
is possible that this is not the case. Therefore, it will be necessary
to compare the characteristics of cell line G42-155 with those of a
cell line established from a M 3-seed.<p>
