INTRODUCTION<p>

In a previous paper (Cattoir-Reynaerts et al., 1981b) we have
described the isolation of mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana (var.
Bensheim) resistant to lysine + threonine and to analogues of
aspartate derived amino acids. In order to use some of these mutants
more efficiently as genetic markers and to obtain new information on
the aspartate metabolism in higher plants the collection of mutants
was investigated more closely.<p>

In a first approach we focused especially on lysine + threonine
resistant mutants. Based on amino acid analyses of free amino acid
pools a first classification of the different mutants was elaborated.
We can distinguish three classes: 1) mutants that are not
distinguishable from the wild type on basis of the analysis of free
amino acid pools, 2) mutants which show an increased threonine content
(2-7 times) in the free amino acid pool 3) mutants with a slightly
increased (2-3 times) free lysine content.<p>

From each class some mutants were chosen for a more detailed
biochemical and genetical analysis. In the present paper we present
some results obtained with a mutant belonging to the second group:
5FALT 26.<p>

MATERIAL AND METHODS<p>

Resistance tests<p>

Seeds were sterilized by treatment with acidified calcium hypochlorite
during 30 min. A drop of neutral detergent was added to the
hypochlorite solution as a wetting agent. After rinsing throroughly
with sterile water the seeds were sown on mineral medium of Feenstra
(1964) with 2% glucose added. Different amino acids and analogues were
filter sterilized and added to the autoclaved medium. After sowing,
petri dishes were preincubated at 4*degrees*C at least for 48 hours
and were incubated afterwards during 8 days at room temperature under
long day conditions.<p>

Amino acid analysis<p>

Eight day old plantlets grown on mineral medium of Feenstra (1964)
with 2% glucose were extracted three times with mixture of
methanol/chloroform/water (12/5/1) (Bielinski and Turner, 1960).
Chlorophyll was removed by addition of two volumes chloroform and
three volumes water.<p>

The aqueous layer was evaporated and the residue was redissolved in 2
N HC1. The extracts were hydrolysed at 100*degrees*C under vacuum.
After evaporation of the acid the residue was dissolved in the first
analysis buffer. The extracts were analysed in a LKB Biochrom 4101
amino acid analyser on DC6A resin using a four buffer program.<p>

Dosage of enzymes of the aspartate biosynthetic pathway.<p>

Aspartate kinase and homoserinedehydrogenase were determined as
described in a previous paper (Cattoir-Reynaerts et al., in press).<p>

Uptake of labeled amino acids<p>

After a cold treatment, sterilized seeds (25/petridish) were
germinated and grown for 8 days on solid medium of Feenstra (1964)
containing 2% glucose. A gauze was used to facilitate transfer from
one medium to another. Two hours before starting an uptake experiment
the plantlets were transferred to liquid Feenstra medium. Afterwards
they were incubated in the presence of a medium consisting of 2.5 ml
of liquid Feenstra medium containing 2.5 micro mole labeled amino
acid, corresponding to 1 micro Ci. After incubation plantlets were
washed three times with the same medium containing unlabeled amino
acids. Plantlets were destained overnight in 0.5 ml H 2 O 2/propanol
(1/1; v/v). Afterwards they were macerated for another 12 hours in 1
ml Lumasolve (Lumac) and radioactivity was measured using Lipoluma
(Lumac) as scintillation cocktail.<p>

Genetical analysis<p>

5 FALT26 was crossed to wild type Arabidopsis and the resistance trait
was followed in F1 and F2 progenies. 5FALT26 was used both as male and
female parent. To identify F1 hybrids wild type Arabidopsis were used
showing a glutamate dehydrogenase or acid phosphatase isozyme pattern
different from Bensheim.<p>

Chemicals<p>

All reagents were commercial products with the exception of
DL-aspartic-b-semialdehyde, which was obtained by reaction of
DL-allylglycine with ozone according to Black and Wright (1955).<p>

RESULTS<p>

5FALT26 was isolated as a homozygously resistant mutant on medium
containing 1 mM of lysine and threonine each and 0.5 mM or arginine
(FALT medium). As mentioned in a previous paper (Cattoir-Reynaerts et
al., 1981a) lysine + threonine exerts are concerted inhibitory effect
on growth of Arabidopsis if arginine is added to the medium. This
inhibition is due to methionine starvation. Arginine is necessary to
avoid inhibitory effects of lysine unrelated to regulation of the
aspartate pathway.<p>

Analysis of free amino acid pools showed that the resistant grown on
medium without amino acids contained about three times more threonine
than the wild type variety Bensheim.<p>

5FALT26 was tested for cross resistance to different analogues of
aspartate derived amino acids, but also to analogues of amino acids
belonging to other biosynthetic families. The results are summarized
in Table 1. No cross resistance was shown for ethionine (methionine
analogue), 5-methyltryptophane (tryptophane analogue),
azetidinecarboxylic acid proline analogue), aminotriazole (histodine
analogue). The mutant is slightly more resistant to the threonine
analogue hydroxynorvaline. However, in contrast to wild type plantlets
5 FALT 26 grows almost as good on medium containing only lysine as on
control medium without amino acids. It is also resistant to the lysine
analogue aminoethylcysteine and to cannavanine (arginine analogue).<p>

analogues.<p>

As increased threonine pools could often be correlated to altered
characteristics of aspartate kinase (Bright et al., 1982;
Cattoir-Reynaerts et al., in press), the activity and regulatory
properties of this enzyme were compared in crude extracts of both wild
type and 5FALT26. The second enzyme controlling threonine
biosynthesis, homoserine dehydrogenase was also investigated. No
essential differences in the regulatory properties of these enzymes
were observed.<p>

As the cross resistant test showed a general resistance to basic amino
acids and their analogues we thought it could be useful to test
uptake, by use of labelled lysine and aminoethylcysteine. In Figure 1
the results of these experiments are shown. The uptake of leucine an
amino acid belonging to another family was also measured as a control.
As the mutant was isolated on lysine + threonine we controlled also
threonine uptake. From Figure 1 it becomes clear that both lysine and
its analogue are taken up at a lower rate by 5FALT26 than by Bensheim,
although leucine uptake is unchanged. The rate of threonine uptake in
5FALT26 is also very similar to wild type uptake, however the mutant
system seems to reach saturation much faster.<p>

After crosses of 5FALT26 with a wild type Arabidopsis and analysis of
the F2 progenies it appears that the resistance to lysine + threonine
as well as to lysine alone is inherited as a double recessive trait.
The results of resistance tests of F1 and F2 progeny are shown in
Table 2.<p>

DISCUSSION<p>

Our results indicate that the lysine + threonine resistance of 5 FALT
26 is probably due to a less efficient uptake of lysine and other
basic amino acids. As a consequence the mutant is also resistant to
analogues of lysine and arginine that penetrate the root system by the
same uptake mechanism. A double recessive mutation appears responsible
for the altered uptake mechanism.<p>

We cannot give a clearcut explanation to the increase of threonine in
the free amino acid pool of 5FALT26. A study of the regulatory enzymes
of biosynthesis of aspartate derived amino acids did not show marked
differences in the regulatory characteristics of the analysed enzymes.
A study of other enzymes involved in threonine synthesis has to be
performed. However, marked differences in the threonine uptake system
have been found. Although the initial uptake rate is unchanged, the
mutant uptake curve reaches saturation much faster. However, this
phenomenon does not appear to be direct cause of incresed threonine
pool. It seems more likely that such increased pool in 5 FALT26 is
responsible for regulatory effects limiting further threonine uptake.<p>

Further analysis is necessary to make clear if the increased threonine
pool is due to the mutations causing the resistance of 5FALT26. As
this trait was not determined in the progeny of crosses of 5FALT26 to
wild type, we cannot be sure that the characteristic is inherited in
the same way as the resistance trait. Analysis of amino acid pools of
the progeny of resistant and non-resistant F2 plants will show if both
can be separated.<p>

From our results it becomes clear that the Arabidopsis selection
system described in a previous paper (Cattoir-Reynaerts et al., 1981b)
is efficient enough to permit the isolation of double mutants. In
contrast to selection on "in vitro" cultures the method allows
isolation of recessive mutations. This will permit us the study of a
broad range of resistance mechancisms to amino acid analogues.<p>
