post-doc position


A post-doctoral position is available in the laboratory of Dr. Venugopala Reddy 
in the Department of Botany and Plant Sciences and Center for Plant Cell Biology 
(CEPCEB), University of California, Riverside, CA.

Our lab is interested in studying the regulatory interactions underlying stem-cell 
maintenance in the Arabidopsis shoot apex. Shoot meristem stem-cell niche 
represents an interacting network of cells in which growth and differentiation 
are dynamically regulated. We combine transient perturbation and live-imaging 
techniques to study spatio-temporal dynamics of regulatory interactions (Reddy 
and Meyerowitz, Science 310, 663-667 (2005);  Reddy et al., Development 131, 
4225 (2004). We also combine transient perturbation methods and microarray 
technologies to elucidate underlying genetic networks.  

Individuals with experience in molecular biology/microarrays and confocal 
microscopy are strongly encouraged to apply.

To apply please forward your CV, and contact information and three references 
via email to venug@ucr.edu or for more information please call (951) 827-3482.
