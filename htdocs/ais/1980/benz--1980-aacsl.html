<h2>PARTIAL DEFICIENCY OF CHLOROPHYLL SYNTHETASE IN THE MUTANT IM 28 of ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA</h2><p>

J. Benz, A.R. Kranz and W. Rodiger<p>

INTRODUCTION<p>

The recently detected enzyme chlorophyll synthetase catalyzes the
reaction of chlorophyllide with geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate (GGPP) to
form chlorophyll GG (geranylgranyl-chlorophyllide) which is then
stepwise hydrogenated to chloropyhyll p (phytylchlorophyllide) by
another enzyme (Rodiger et al., 1980; Benz et al., 1980).
Protochlorophyllide is not the substrate for chlorophyll synthetase
(Figure 1). This is presumably the reason for the accumulation of
(unesterified) protochlorophyllide in most higher plants in the dark.
Estrification which takes place only after photoconversion to
chlorophyllide is then the precondition for binding of the entire
chlorophyll to specific proteins and for the subsequent accumulation
of chlorophyll in the thylakoid membrane in the light.<p>

The question arose whether chlorophyll defiency (i.e., the lack of
chlorophyll accumulation in the light) would be due to deficiency in
the enzyme chlorophyll synthetase. Criteria for such a situation
should be a normal protochlorophyllide content of dark grown plants, a
normal photoconversion to chlorophyllide but a decreased
esterification under standard conditions. As plant material, the
chlorophyll deficient mutant im28/im/28 of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.)
Heynh. was chosen.<p>

light-dependent step is involved, all other steps occur also in the
dark.<p>

MATERIAL AND METHODS<p>

The following seed samples of the AIS gene bank, Frankfurt am Main
were used: wild type En-2 (AIS-standard line ch+/ch+, 1553, 77/87) and
An-2 (original line of the mutant im+/im+, 1609, 78/74), mutant line
("immutans", variegated and chlorophyll defective, Robbelen 1968,
im28/im28, 1712, 79/78). 150 mg seeds yielding 7000 seedlings approx.
per line were germinated for 14 days. Germination and aseptic culture
conditions were as previously described (Kranz, 1977) except for
growth in the dark (vernalization by 72 hours, of 5+/-1*degree*C, and
photoinduction by 15 min. far red + 30 min. red light). Plants at the
4-leaf-stage were harvested under dim-green safelight. The yield of
etiolated tissue was (fresh weight): En-2 = 0.5 g; An-2= 2.0 g; im28 =
1.8 g. Broken etioplasts were prepared from this tissue as previously
described but omitting the centrifugation step at 1000 g (Rodiger et
al., 1980). To each sample, 3 mg (3.6 *micro*mol) NADPH and 48 micro g
(98 mol) GGPP were added and each sample completed to a total volume
of 3.0 ml with 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.1. The samples
were then illuminated with white fluorescent light for 3 min. (optimum
photoconversion) and incubated at 28*degrees*C for 60 min. in the dark
(optimum estrification). The reaction was stopped with acetone and the
pigments extracted and determined as previously described by
HPLC-technique (Rodiger et al., 1980).<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

Growth of etiolated Arabidopsis plants was good with wild type An-2
and the mutant im28 but less sufficient with the wild type En-2. This
may be due to slight variations of the genotypes with respect to the
optimum culture conditions. The plant material was sufficient,
however, for the analysis carried out here.<p>

Previous experiments with etiolated tissue from oats (Schoch et al.,
1977) and beans (Schoch, 1978) had revealed that the original
protochlorophyll(ide) content could be either determined directly in
aliquots of the plant material or after photoconversion and
estrification as "total pigment" (i.e. protochlorophyll(ide) +
chlorophyll(ide)). We chose the latter possibility here because this
avoided possible difficulties from taking aliquots of plant material.
The mount of total pigment corresponding to the protochlorophyll(ide)
originally present is nearly identical in the wild types and the
mutant line if related to the harvested fresh weight (Table 1). The
photoconversion after saturating illumination is also nearly identical
(Table 1). The high values found here for photoconversion in vitro can
only found if saturating concentrations of NADPH are present in the
incubation mixture (Griffiths, 1974, 1978).<p>

The esterification of endogenous chlorophyllide with a large excess of
exogenous GGPP can be as high as 90% under standard conditions
(Rodiger et al., 1980). We found this high esterification in a
preliminary experiment with the wild type En-2 but no detectable
esterification with the mutant im 28. The repetition of this
experiment (Table 2) confirmed the high esterification with the wild
type En-2 but revealed also some esterification (25%) with the mutant
im 28. This means that there is no complete lack of chlorophyll
synthetase in im 28 but the enzyme level must be lower in the mutant
than in the wild type. This partial deficiency of chlorophyll
synthetase also holds for comparison of im 28 with the wild type An-2
from which this mutant is derived. It should be recalled here that the
relative yields of esterified pigments (92 : 41 : 25% for En-2 : An-2
: im 28) do not directly reflect the relative amounts of enzyme. The
exact determination of enzyme units is only possible by kinetic
measurements for which either much more plant material or greatly
refined analytical methods are required.<p>

Table 1: Original protochlorophyll(ide) content and photoconversion to
chlorophyll(ide) in 14 days old etiolated Arabidopsis plants (wild
types En-2 and An-2, mutant line im 28). Original
protochlorophyll(ide) was determined as total pigment
(protochlorophyll(ide) + chlorophyll(ide)) after photoconversion and
esterification. Photoconversion is defined as chlorophyll (ide) based
on total pigment = 100%<p>

Table 2: Esterification of chlorophyllide in vitro with GGPP as
exogenous substrate and analysis of esterified chlorophyll. Endogenous
substrate can lead to chlorophyll p. Esterified pigment based on
chlrophyllide formed by photoconversion = 100%; chlorophyll GG, H2GG,
H4GG, p based on esterified chlorophyll = 100%.<p>

Another interesting result was the analysis of esterified chlorophyll
(Figure 1). If the reaction of chlorophyllide would proceed only with
exogenous GGPP chlorophyll GG would be the only reaction product.
Under the conditions applied here, hydrogenation to chlorophyll H2GG
takes place but the further hydrogenation to chlorophyll H4GG and
chlorophyll p is negligible (Benz et al., 1980). The analysis showed
that a considerable percentage of the esterified pigment was
chlorophyll p (Table 2). Under comparable conditions with oat
etioplasts, chlorophyll p is formed from an endogenous phytol
precursor which could not be displaced by GGPP (Benz, 1980). Obviously
such an endogenous phytol precursor is also present in the Arabidopsis
lines investigated here. Its amount must be larger in the wild types
En-2 (32% chlorophyll) and An-2 (25% chlorophyll p) than in the mutant
line im 28 (17% chlorophyll p). The possible relationship between the
low content of endogenous phytol precursor, the partial deficiency of
chlorophyll synthetase, and their putative, pleiotropic control by the
mutant gene im 28 is further investigated.<p>
