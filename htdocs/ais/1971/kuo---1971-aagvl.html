Methods for the extraction and partition of high molecular weight RNA
were reported by BONOTTO and JACOBS (1967, 1968).  Since the
separation according to their procedure requires the use of
ultracentrifuge another simpler technique is outlined below, as
adapted from the methods of GIRARD (1967) and OSAWA and SIBATANI
(1967):<p>

1.  Homogenize 2 grams lyophilized tissue in 22.5 ml cold acetate EDTA
buffer + 1.5 ml 10% SDS (Sodium duodecyl-sulfate) + 6 ml bentonite (50
mg/ml).<p>

2.  Add 30 ml 88% phenol (purified according to DRAPER and POLLARD,
1949), shake vigorously in 60*degrees*C water bath for 3 min, cool in
ice bath and centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 3-5 min, discard the phenol
(lower) phase.<p>

3.  Add again 20 ml phenol and shake for 2 min at 60*degrees*C, cool
and centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 3-5 min, discard the phenol phase.<p>

4.  Repeat with 14 ml phenol, carefully collect upper phase.<p>

5.  Add 0.1 volume of 2 M NaCl and 2 volumes of 95% ethanol
(-20*degrees*C), mix and transfer to centrifuge tubes, keep it at
-20*degrees*C for at least 2 hours, collect the precipitate by
centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 1/2 to 1 hour, -10*degrees*C.<p>

6.  Repeat alcohol precipitation twice.<p>

7.  Suspend the pellet in a small volume (5 ml) of 0.2 M acetate
buffer, dialyze against 0.01 M acetate buffer for 24 hours.<p>

8.  Fractionate on MAK column (prepared by the method of OSAWA and
SIBATANI, 1967), wash column with 150 ml 0.1 saline buffer then elute
with 400 ml 0.4 M + 400 ml 1.6 M saline buffer (gradient elution),
collect 5 ml fractions of the eluate and measure optical density at
260 m micro.<p>

column.  The first two small peaks contain bases, nucleosides and
nucleotide contaminations. The first major peak is transfer RNA, the
second major peak contains ribosomal RNA.<p>
