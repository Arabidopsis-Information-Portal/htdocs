A postdoctoral position in plant development and genomics is available in
2007 in the research group of Björn Sundberg at the Umeå Plant Science
Centre in Umeå, Sweden. The successful applicant will join a collaborative
project between the Sundberg group and the research group of Brian Ellis at
the Michael Smith Laboratories (University of British Columbia) in
Vancouver, Canada. This project focuses on identification of molecular
mechanisms underlying secondary cell wall re-modelling in poplar and
arabidopsis. We are using tension wood formation in poplar as a model to
identify key genes and components involved in developmental regulation of
cell fate and wall polymers. A range of genomic and molecular technologies
will be employed to reveal mechanisms that integrate and process
environmental, hormonal and developmental signals controlling wood
formation. The groups also have access to state of the art technology to
characterise fibres, cell walls and wood, and are members in national
networks such as "FuncFiber", "Biomime" and “GreenCrop”.  The applicant will
be integrated into ongoing research on ethylene control of wood development,
but will also have possibilities to develop other lines of research within
the area.  This research will be conducted in both Umeå and Vancouver, thus
providing a unique opportunity to enjoy the world-class facilities and
research environment in each location. Applicants should have demonstrated
strength in plant molecular and cell biology, experience with genomic
technologies, a commitment to research excellence and the ability to work
effectively across model systems.  The postdoctoral fellowship is for 1 year
with a possible extension of 1 year. The salary will be in the range of 15
500 – 17 500 SEK per month (tax free), depending on experience and family
situation. Closing date for applications is November 27, 2006. Applicants
should submit afull curriculum vitae including 2 references to Prof. Björn
Sundberg by e-mail: bjorn.sundberg@genfys.slu.se
