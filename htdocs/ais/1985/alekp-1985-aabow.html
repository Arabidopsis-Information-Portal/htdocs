The search of effective antimutagens is now becoming one of the most
urgent problems. The most promising field for solving this problem is
the study of biologically active substances of vegetable origin. As a
rule these substances are characterized by lack of toxicity,
accessibility and low price. This paper deals with studying the effect
of the wheat extract (Triticum aestivum) on induced mutations in A.
thaliana used as a test object for antimutagenetic analysis
(Alek-Perov et al., 1983)<p>

The method for obtaining the wheat germ extracts has been described
elsewhere (Rustamova et al., 1985). Mutations were induced by: 1.
X-irradiation of A. thaliana seeds at a dose of 100 Gray; 2. Wetting
of A. thaliana seeds in nitrosoguanidine solution (1 mM) for 3 hours
followed by washing in running water for 30 minutes. After treatment
with mutagen, the part of seeds was planted in the minimal agarized
medium (control groups). The seeds of the experimental groups were
treated with the extract for 18 hours before planting in the given
medium. Unripe pods were analyzed by Muller's embryo test for the
presence of chlorophyll mutations.<p>

The results are given in Table 1. This table shows that the wheat
extract allows to decrease the percent of mutation significantly
independent on whether they are resulted from X-radiation or from
chemical antimutagen. In the first case mutations decrease from 10.4
+/- 2.3% to 3.5 +/- 1.39%, i.e., 6.9 +/- 2.76%, and in the second one
from 13.9 +/- 3.32% to 5.3 +/- 2.09% i.e., 8.6 +/- 3.92%.<p>

frequency of induced mutation in A. thaliana.<p>

Thus, the investigation of A. thaliana confirmed data on the
effectiveness of antimutagenic activity of the wheat extract obtained
earlier in the meristematic cells of Allium fistulosum radicles and
cells of rat marrow (Rustamova et al., 1985). The presence of the
antimutagenic effect of the vegetable extract in using various
inductors of mutations and significantly different test objects
exhibit the universality of antimutagenic activity of analyzed
substances. The emergence of the extract components characterizing the
antimutagenic effect seems to be of great profit.<p>
