POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN POLLEN-PISTIL INTERACTIONS AND
CROSS-INCOMPATIBILITY IN MAIZE AND TEOSINTE

A NSF-funded postdoctoral position is available for two years starting April
2010 at the Carnegie Institution for Science located on the campus of
Stanford University to study cross-incompatibility between maize and
teosinte and to clone the Teosinte crossing barrier1 gene.
We are looking for a highly motivated individual with a PhD in molecular
biology, genetics, or related disciplines and a demonstrated ability to
carry out outstanding research. A strong background in genetics and
molecular biology is desired. Experience in maize genetics is advantageous
but not required. Excellent communication skills and an ability and
willingness to collaborate are essential. The successful applicant is also
expected to interact with undergraduates participating in summer research
projects.

Interested individuals should send an application package through e-mail (a
cover letter detailing experience; CV; publication reprints; and names,
telephone numbers and e-mail addresses of three references) to Matt Evans,
