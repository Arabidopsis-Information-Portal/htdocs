A postdoctoral position is immediately available with the Plant Molecular 
Biology group at the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência (IGC) located near Lisbon, 
Portugal. The team uses Arabidopsis thaliana as a model system to investigate 
the molecular mechanisms that mediate the response of plants to environmental 
signals in order to ensure the developmental plasticity and stress tolerance 
essential for their survival.

The lab is currently focusing on two main projects:

1) Alternative splicing in plant stress and development

2) Role of multidrug resistance transporters in herbicide resistance



We seek creative, highly motivated candidates with the ability to work 
independently and a strong background in molecular biology. Previous expertise 
in biochemistry techniques is preferred.

Interested candidates should send CV, cover letter, and contact information of 
three references to duquep@igc.gulbenkian.pt until May 31, 2007.
