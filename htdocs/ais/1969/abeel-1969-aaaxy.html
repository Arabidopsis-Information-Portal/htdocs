In No. 5 of this newsletter we demonstrated the existence of tRNA
transmethylase enzymes in Arabidopsis thaliana (ABEELS, 1968); that
existance is here further described using tRNA from E. coli, strain
K-12 58/161, grown in minimal or in complete growth medium. As for the
study of DNA transmethylase enzymes (ABEELS and DIGNEFFE, 1969) we
took more tRNA sources because a methylation pattern made in vitro is
dependent of the number of recognition sites for transmethylase
enzymes. The technic was tested using enzymes from E.  coli with tRNA
from starved or not starved bacteria, because except for E. coli
58-161 starved it seems impossible to make homologous methylation
(tRNA and enzymes from the same strain) GOLD, HURWITZ and ANDERS,
1963).<p>

A more interesting result came from the study of the chromatographic
pattern of the digestion with T1 ribonuclease enzyme of tRNA after
incubation with methylation.<p>

Results:<p>

(1) tRNA rich in methyl groups + enzymes of E. coli = no methylation<p>

(2) tRNA starved + enzymes of E. coli = methylation<p>

(3) tRNA rich + enzymes from Arabidopsis thaliana = very low
methylation<p>

(4) tRNA starved + enzymes from Arabidopsis thaliana = good
methylation.<p>

Chromatography of 1n-HC1 hydrolysis 1 hr, 100*degrees*C of tRNA from
(2) and (4) indicates the presence of 6-dimethylaminopurine,
6-methylaminopurine, methylguanine, methyluracil, and methylcytosine.
The oligonucleotide T1 patterns of (2) and (4) were similar in
localization of radioactivity but different in extension; the level of
(4) was half that of (2). T1 patternn of (3) was very difficult to
establish because of the very low radioactivity of the spots.  In
conclusion: tRNA transmethyulase enzmes of Arabidopsis thaliana
certainly recognizes a good part of the methylation sites of E. coli,
coding properties must be similar for a number of loci, but it should
be very intresting to analyze the relationships between tRNA
synthetase of Arabidopsis thaliana and tRNA from E. coli; such an
investigation is presently made in our laboratory.<p>

Technical procedure: The same technics were used as in No. 5 of this
newsletter, except<p>

-- the sRNA from E. coli was extracted following the more precise
method of RAMMLER et al. (1965)<p>

-- localization of nucleotides was made with right angle
chromatography solvent I n-butanol H20 86:14 v/v1 NH3 gas, solvent II
isopropanol-oonc. HCl-H20 (170:41-39 by vol.)<p>

-- T: digestion was made in phosphate buffer, pH 7.5<p>
