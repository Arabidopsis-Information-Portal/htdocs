Recent data have shown that leucine might play an important role in
several mechanisms related to photosynthesis and the phtotosynthetic
apparatus: light dependence, chlorophyll levels, amino acid/pigment
correlations, active site of the ribulose 1,5-di-phosphate carboxylase
(Ru-di-P-CO2ase), chloroplastic localization and at least, phosphatase
and ATPase control.<p>

Light and pigment dependence<p>

When plants previously grown aseptically under 19h day photoperiod
with 2500 lux, are placed for 5h under dim light treatment (25 lux),
the amino acid level of the rosette leaves increased as the
chlorophyll amount decreases: the highest amplitude variation was
observed for leucine and iso-leucine, reaching 410% of the amount of
control plants (BOUNIAS, 1972a and b).<p>

This was related to the negative correlations determined between amino
acid and photosynthetic pigment concentrations in Arabidopsis and
barley plants (chlorophyll mutants and original forms) kept under
different physiological conditions (BOUNIAS, 1972a and 1975). Thus, it
was not surprising that large amounts of amino acids were to be found
in different mutants lacking chlorophyll (VELEMINSKY, 1965p SVACHULOVA
et al., 1967).<p>

Then it was shown that both in Arabidopsis and barley leaves, the
incorporation of leucine at low doses (2 to 4mM) increased the amount
of photosynthetic pigments, while high doses (10 mM) induced a
decrease of the pigment levels, in both cases according to the
kinetics of intracellular penetration of the amino acid
(outside/inside ratio 1 x 10E-6) (BOUNIAS, 1972 and 1973)<p>

By this way, almost normal amounts of pigments and other metabolites
could be restored in different chlorophyll mutants.  Moreover, it was
thus observed that leucine doses required for either activation or
inhibition of the photosynthetic apparatus could be different in some
mutants than in original forms, because of differences in penetration
rate and effect intensity. This was in agreement with the results of
KAS'YANANKO and NASYROV (1970) and BABADZHANOVA et al. (1971).<p>

The active site of the ribulose-1,5-di-phosphate carboxylase
(Ru-di-P-CO2ase).<p>

Different results obtained in other plants could lead to the
conclusion that leucine and iso-leucine, which are able to fix 14CO2
chemically, are the main constituents of the Ru-di-P-CO2ase active
site (AKOYUNOGLOU, 1969); this enzyme activity depends on light
(MARGULIES, 1970) and chlorophyll levels (KLEINKOPF, 1970); and BOWES
and OGREN (1970) showed that the decrase of activity under dim-light
was not firt due to a decrease of amount of the proteic apo-enzyme.
This strengthened the hypothesis of reversible inactivation of the
active site with release of free leucine and iso-leucine under dim
light.<p>

The role of leucine on the Ru-di-P-CO2ase activity and photosynthetic
intensity was confirmed for Arabidopsis by BABADZHANOVA et al.
(1971), in the case of a chlorophyll mutant and it could be possible
that the differences of 14 CO2 fixation between several mutant
analyzed by SVACHULOVA (1971) are due to the leucine amounts, mobility
or metabolism.<p>

Intracellular localization and phosphatase regulation.<p>

Histochemical investigations including 14C-auto-histo-radiography
showed that L. leucine is located in chloroplastic grana in which it
can be highly concentrated (BOUNIAS, 1969, 1972a, 1974a) and that
alkaline phosphatase and ATPase sites were of the same type.<p>

Evidence was then given that in barley leaves both activation and
inhibition of pigment systems coincide with activation and inhibition
of alkaline phosphatase by L. leucine, in vivo and in vitro (BOUNIAS,
1972a and c). The determination of dose-effect curves and of the
kinetic-parameters of enzyme activity lead to the conclusion that L.
leucine is an allosteric effector of alkaline phosphatase activity and
L. aza4-leucine an antagonist (BOUNIAS, 1974b).<p>
