<h2> Gibberellin effects in dwarf mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana</h2><p>

During the last years we have undertaken a number of experiments on
the influence of gibberellins on several developmental phenomena
(flower induction, apical dominance, growth of the main axis) in
numerous Arabidopsis races and mutants.  A publication of SUGE and
MURAKAMI (1968) induces us to anticipate some results concerning two
dwarf mutants which had been obtained by McKELVIE (1962) with a summer
annual strain.<p>

Dwarf forms of Arabidopsis thaliana have already been known as early
as 1877 (VIVIAND-MOREL, 1877-78).  One of the types we have used (le)
is characterized by a very reduced stalk (one or two internodes of
some millimetres length, besides the influorescence); lateral shoots
are poorly developed.  The other one (ca) has a short stalk, too, a
still more "compressed" influorescence, longer siliques, and a more
bushy growth habit.  Upon a treatment with several gibberellins, both
dwarf mutants reacted in a different way: With the ca-plants, most
gibberellins led to earlier flowering without changing the growth
habit noticeably.  On the other hand, the gibberellins did not
influence significantly the age of flowering of the le-plants (which
in any case, flowered earlier than the ca-plants); their stalks,
however, became longer which is reflected, among others, by the
inclusion of a greater number of internodes into the stalk, while the
number of rosette internodes was reduced and the total internode
number remained practically the same (see Table).<p>

Table: Influence of several gibbrellins upon flowering and stalk
formation in the dwarf mutants ca and le of Arabidopsis thaliana.
Plants treated 10 times at half-weekly intervals (from the 3rd to the
7th week of growth) with 0,04-0,05 ml of a 20 ppm solution (Tween 80
added), put upon the rosette leaves; grown at 20*degrees*C and
continuous fluorescent plus incandescent light (4.500 lx).  Numbers of
plants per group between parentheses.<p>

Thus, the influence of gibberellins upon shoot growth and upon
flowering may be easily separated with these dwarf mutants of
Arabidopsis.  With regard to growth habit, the behaviour of the mutant
ca corresponds to that of certain dwarf mutants of Zea mays and of
Oryza sativa which do not react upon a gibberellin treatment by
increased stalk growth, or the gibberellin contents of which are not
lower than those of comparable normal types (cf. SUGE and MURAKAMI,
1968; PHINNEY, 1956); nevertheless, flowering is clearly influenced by
gibberellins in this case.  Only as far as the mutant le is concerned,
dwarfism is overcome by gibberellins, as it is known from many other
dwarf forms.<p>
