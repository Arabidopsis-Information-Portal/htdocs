INTRODUCTION<p>

A number of populations indicate the evolution of tolerance to
environmental pollution in plant populations. Studies of heavy metal
tolerance have proven that processes of adaptation to these pollutants
are quite common (Antonovics et al., 1971) and rapid (Ernst et al.,
1983). Results of several works have demonstrated some measure of
tolerance to DO 2 action (Horsman et al., 1979; Wilson and Bell,
1985). Although tolerance is an expression of change in the population
gene pool there is relatively little data available on actual changes
in genetic structure of populations exposed to environmental stress.
The majority of literature on this subject refers to natural
populations of aquatic invertebrates: barnacles (Nevo et al., 1978)
and Asellus aquaticus (Verspoor, 1983). Studies on impact of
environmental pollution on plant population gene pool are scarce and
almost entirely limited to forest tree species (Muller-Starck, 1985;
Prus-Glowacki and Nowak-Bzowy, 1987). In this work we compare the
genetic structure of Arabidopsis thaliana populations from areas of
different pollution level.<p>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<p>

Samples of 18 A. thaliana populations were collected from four regions
of Poland: 1. Ciechanow Upland, 2. Krakowsko-Czestochowska Uplant, 3.
Upper Silesia, 4. Beskidy Mts. Geographical localization of
populations is presented in Figure 1.<p>

On the basis of air pollution data obtained from District
Sanitary-Epidemiological Stations we divided studied populations into
two groups (Table 1).<p>

Eleven populations exposed to higher concentrations of pollutants were
sampled from Upper Silesia (or its close vicinity) and they were
called "Silesian group". The remaining seven populations from regions
of lower anthropopressure formed a "control group".<p>

From each population a random sample of 35 seeds was sown on Brown's
medium and plants were grown in aseptic cultue at a growth chamber (22
+/- 3*degrees*C, 10000 lx). Rosette leaves were used as a tissue for
horizontal starch gel electrophoresis. Two buffer systems were used to
separate isozymes: System I - 0.135M Tris, 0.029M citric acid
(electrode), 0.009M Tris, 0.002M citric acid (gel) - pH 8.0. Enzyme
systems: Lap (EC 3.4.11.1), Got (EC 2.6.1.1), IDH (EC 1.1.1.42) and
GDH (EC 1.2.1.2).<p>

System II - 0.135M Tris, 0.041M citric acid (electrode), 0.009M Tris,
0.003M citric acid (gel) - pH 7.0. Enzyme systems: ACP (EC 3.1.3.2),
EST (EC 3.1.1.2) and MDH (EC 1.1.-1.37).<p>

Staining procedures and mode of designation of enzymating variants to
particular loci were similar to presented by FUGLEWICZ and KILIAN
(1985). We calculated several indices of genetic variation for studied
populations from electrophoretic data:<p>

 -NEI's (1973) diversity statistic. H - for a single locus and H-bar -
averaged over all loci;
Polymorphism index (KAHLER et al., 1980), Pj for a single locus and
P-barj - averaged over all loci;
Proportion of polymorphic loci (P);
Proportion of heterzygosity per locus per individual (Het).  Since the
mode of inheretence for esterase isozymes is not known, we estimated
isozyme polymorphism index-PI (MARSHALL and JAIN, 1969) for this
enzyme system.<p>

RESULTS<p>

Air pollution data (mean for years 1980-1982) for areas from which
population samples were collected are presented in Table 1. Mean
values of annual dustfall and concentrations of toxic gases are more
than twice as high for the Silesian group as compared to the group.<p>

MDH and GOT were the systems which did not exhibit variation in this
study. Esterase isozymes were highly variable but we did not succeed
in determining the genetic basis of this variation. Isozymes observed
for the remaining four systems were encoded by six loci: one locus for
IDH and GDH and to loci for LAP and ACP. Two loci of acid phosphatase
and the locus of isocitrate dehydrogenase were the most variable in
this study. The level of polymorphism varied considerably for
particular loci and populations but the group of Silesian populations
was on the average more variable than the control group (Table 2).<p>

Table 2: Genetic variation of A. thaliana populations<p>

The average values of all genetic parameters are at least twice as
great for Silesian populations as that for the control group. The
proportion of heterozygosity (Het) was almost five times higher for
the group of populations exposed to environmental stress.<p>

The association of genetic polymorphism of populations with air
quality variables was tested by calculating Spearman rank correlation
coefficients (Table 3). The correlation between pollution variables
and the four measures of genetic variation (H, PJ, PI EST, and P) was
positive and in all but one case was statistically significant. Both
groups of characters are highly incorrelated themselves (P < 0.01).<p>

In order to determine a pattern of interpopulational variation in
allozyme frequencies Principal Component Analysis was carried out
(Figure 2). The distribution of populations in a three-dimensional
space of First (V 1), Second (V 2) and third (V 3) Principal Component
does not indicate any geographical trend. It is interesting that both
groups of populations seem to differ considerably in allelic
frequencies as they tend to occupy different fragments of the
principal component space. Only populations 8, 10 and 12 from Silesia
exhibited similarity to the control group.<p>

variables and genetic variability indices.<p>

The differentiation in allelic frequencies between both groups for
particular loci was tested by using the genic contingency *chi*sq. test
proposed by Workman and Niswander (1970). The formula for this test is
given by:<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol25/vol25-pg62-fig0.gif">Click here for figure</a><p>

where pJ and *sigma*sq. pJ denote the weighted mean and variance of
the frequencies of jt^h allele, N - total number of analyzed
individuals and k - number of alleles. Range and mean of allozyme
frequencies for Silesian and control group as well as values of the
genic contingency *chi*sq. test are presented in Table 4. The differences
in allelic frequencies between both group were highly significant for
all loci. We tested additionally the association of allozyme
frequencies with atmospheric pollution. Spearman correlation
coefficients were estimated between air quality variables and the
values of First, Second and Third Principal Component based on
allozyme frequencies (Table 5). Dustfall was significantly correlated
with Second and Third PC, while concentrations of the toxic gases were
significantly associated with V 2.<p>

DISCUSSION<p>

The results of this study point to the strong genetic differentiation
of Silesian populations from populations sampled from less polluted
areas. This conclusion may be drawn from the results of PCA and X 2
test. These results suggest that environmental pollution has been
playing an important role as the selective factor in A. thaliana
populations. Pollutants act selectively on marker loci and/or linked
blocks of genes. Significant correlations between air pollution
variables and V 2 may account for a strong support to the
aforementioned hypothesis.<p>

An interesting example of the effect of air pollutants on the genetic
structure of Scots-pine population from Silesia was presented by
Prus-Glowacki and Nowak-Bzowy (1987). The population exposed to heavy
metal emission exhibited rapid changes of its genetic structure
towards increased variability and heterozygosity, especially in the
younger age classes. In a control population this process was far less
dynamic.<p>

A. thaliana populations from Silesia differed from the control group
not only in allelic frequencies but also in the level of genetic
variability. Moreover, the level of genetic diversity exhibited
significant correlations with the air pollution variables which
suggest that the high level of variation represents an adaptive
strategy in response to the stressful environment.<p>

At present it is very difficult to answer the question about the
factors responsible for the differences in the level of variation
between both groups of populations. Several processes might contribute
to such result. Genetic drift, for example, might be responsible for
the lower level of variation in the control group. Although there were
no apparent differences in the populations size between both groups,
we cannot reject the possibility of genetic "bottleneck effect" or
"founder effect" as we are not able to reconstruct the history of
studied populations. Among the systematic processes, mutation and
change of breeding system should be mentioned as possible factors that
influenced the level of genetic variability in Silesian populations.
We detected a remarkable increase of mutation frequencies in
artificial populations of A. thaliana exposed to high concentrations
of industrial pollutants (unpublished data). There is also some
evidence of increased outcrossing rate in a number of Silesian
populations in comparison to the control group (unpublished data).<p>

Although the processes mentioned above might contribute to the result
of this study some form of selection seems to be the most likely
explanation of higher variability of the Silesian group. Bearing in
mind the 5-fold higher proportion of hetrozygosity in Silesian
populations we point to heterozygous advantage. According to a concept
of "conditional heterosis" (Berger, 1976; Milkman, 1987) the
overdominance effect (sensu lato) should be greater in a more extreme
or stressful environment. In a harsh environment (heavily polluted for
example) greater physiological tolerance and functional versatility of
heterozygotes (Fincham, 1972) could give the considerable selective
advantage. Final conclusions will be presented after experimental
analysis of selective and other populations processes in an artificial
A. thaliana population exposed to environmental polution.<p>

SUMMARY<p>

Populations of A. thaliana from heavily polluted region of Silesia
exhibited higher level of genetic variation in six enzymatic loci than
the group of control populations (from the areas of lower
anthropressure). Indices of genetic variability and allozyme
frequencies were correlated with air pollution variables. The results
suggest that environmental pollutants act as selective agents on
marker loci and/or linked blocks of genes.<p>
