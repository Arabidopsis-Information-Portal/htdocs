Applicants are invited for a postdoctoral position in the laboratory of Dr. Min
Ni at the University of Minnesota, starting date after August 1, 2013 or
negotiable. Experience in molecular biology, cellular biology, molecular
genetics, and biochemistry will be a plus. Our lab is currently focused on two
separate research areas: light-regulated responses and Arabidopsis seed
development. We have identified and characterized a few key regulators involved
in these processes. We aim to study their actions and interactions with other
components or signaling pathways by using a variety of tools. The successful
applicant will also have an opportunity to characterize a few more EMS mutants
by sequencing, identify the targets of a few players specifically or on a
genomic scale, and isolate additional interacting protein components in the
systems. For further information, please visit our web site (
