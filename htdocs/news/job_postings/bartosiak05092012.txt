Postdoctoral Research Associate in Plant Molecular Biology/Molecular 
Genetics 

Description 

A Postdoctoral Research Associate position in plant molecular 
biology/molecular genetics is available in the Biosciences Division at Oak 
Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The successful candidate will join a 
multi-disciplinary team of investigators undertaking broad, integrated 
approaches to enhance feedstock characteristics and productivity of 
bioenergy crops and to address critical issues in plant-microbe and 
plant-environment interactions. In particular, the successful candidate will 
be responsible for molecular characterization of genes identified from 
genome-wide association and Omics studies using the model plant Arabidopsis 
and bioenergy crop Populus.
