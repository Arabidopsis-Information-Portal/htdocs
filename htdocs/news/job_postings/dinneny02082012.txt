POSTDOCTORAL POSITION AVAILABLE 
Carnegie Institution for Science, Department of Plant Biology 
  
A postdoctoral position will be available in May, 2012 in the Dinneny lab at the Carnegie Institution for Science, 
Department of Plant Biology. Our lab is interested in the mechanisms governing the response of roots to high 
salinity. The project available is focused on utilizing synthetic biology and genome-scale technologies to crack 
the cis-element code to determine how gene expression patterns are generated. I am particularly interested in 
applicants who have experience and interest in working with transcriptional networks, ChIP-chip/Seq data and some 
knowledge of bioinformatics/programming. 
  
Applicants are expected to have a strong publication track record, exhibit a creative scientific approach in 
their work and enjoy collaborative interactions. Interested applicants should send their cover letter and CV with 
contact information for 3 references to Jose Dinneny (dinneny@stanford.edu). Please include in the cover letter a 
description of your research interests and career goals. The position will initially be available for 1 year with 
renewal of up to 2 years based on the performance of the individual. The position may be extendable beyond 3 years 
based on the availability of outside funding.
