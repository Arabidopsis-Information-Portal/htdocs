At attempt was made to apply a Giemsa C-banding technique for staining
heterochromatin (MARKS and SCHWEIZER, 1974) to Arabidopsis thaliana so
as to characterize the somatic metaphase chromosomes by their
morphology and C-banding pattern.  In this communication we report a
procedure that can be routinely used and by which the chromosomes can
be individually identified. The value of the technique is demonstrated
in a preliminary study of a primary trisomic where the supernumerary
could be positively identified.<p>

Seeds of standard line Col-O and trisomic line T-20 (AIS accession
number 828) were germinated on moist filter paper in Petri dishes at
room temperature for 2-4 days.  Seedlings were pretreated with
8-hydroxiquinoline (0.002 M0 for 2 h at 16-18*degrees*C. The plantlets
were fixed in ethanol (96%)/ glacial acetic acid (3:1) and stored in
the fixative for 1-2 days in the refrigerator. For Giemsa banding the
procedure developed by MARKS (1975) was found to be the most suitable.
With some minor modifications the technique adopted comprised the
following principal stages: fixed seedlings were hydrolysed in
prewarmed 45% acetic acid at 60*degrees*C for 12 min.  Hydrolysis was
stopped by transferring the material to cold distilled water. The root
tips were squashed in 45% acetic acid in the usual manner. The
prepartions were placed in dry ice, the cover slip was prised off, and
the preparations were dried at room temperture overnight.
Preparations were then treated with aqueous solution of
bariumhydroxide (4.5g Ba(OH)2.  8H20 in 100 ml distilled water) at
room temperature for ten minutes and thoroughly rinsed with several
changes of distilled water for 10-15 min.  The preparations were
incubated in 2 x SSC (=0.3 M NaCl plus 0.03 M trisodium citrate) at
60-63*degrees*C for 1-2 h.  Distilled water was then added to the
buffer and the slides rinsed with distilled water. For Giemsa staining
Merck Giemsa stock solution was diluted 50x with Sorensen phosphate
buffer, pH 6.9, immediately before use. Staining was repeatedly
monitored and optimum staining was found to occur after about 1/2 h.
The preparations were quickly rinsed with distilled water, air-dried,
and mounted in Euparal.  For microscopic analysis and photography a
yellow-green monochromatic filter (SS-546-11) was used which was found
to give C-bands of maximum contrast. Details of karyotype analysis are
given elsewhere (SCHWEIZER and EHRENDORFER, 1976).<p>

Arabidopsis thaliana, Giemsa C-banding.  a,b: full complement and

All chromosomes had a distinct Giemsa C-band at the centromere
(possibly consisting of two units) and some chromosomes had an
additional terminal band, about 12.5% of total chromosome length being
banded. The centromeric banding amounts to 10.5%. Giemsa stained
nuclei of root tip meristems usually had 10-11 darkly staining
chromocentres ("prochromosomes") which can be related to the
centromeric bands and the terminal bands.  Although the Giemsa stained
karyotype lacks characteristic non-centromeric marker bands, it was
possible to identify the individual chromosomes on the basis of band
width and band distribution in conjunction with the relative lengths
and arm ratios. Figure 1 a-k shows ten individual C-banded karyotypes
of Arabidopsis thaliana trisomic line T-20 (originally selected by
STEINITZ-SEARS and REDEI, kindly provided by Prof. Dr. A.R. KRANZ),
four of which have an additional chromosome (g-k).  A karyogram is
depicted at the bottom of Figure 1.  Chromosomes 1-4 have been
arrranged in order of decreasing length, nucleolar chromosome 5 was
very variable in length because of frequent stretching of the
satellited short arm; it was smaller than 3 but definitely larger than
4.  The centromere position of chromosomes 1, 2, 3 and 5 is median,
the centromere of chromosome 4 has a subterminal position. There
appears to exist some overall similarity between the karyogram in
Figure 1 and an earlier karyogram reported by MESICECK (1967), but
there was little correspondence for chromosomes 3 and 4. The
chromosome types shown in Figure 1 may be characterized as follows:
chromosome 1: largest chromosome of the complement with a distinct
band at the centromere, and variable very faint terminal banding;
relative length (total haploid complement = 100% = 25.4%, arm ratio
(long arm/total chromosome length) = 22.2%, arm ratio 0.53. Chromosome
3: centromeric band, relative length 19.6%, arm ratio 0.58.
Chromosome 4: smallest chromosome of the complement with centromeric
band, long arm with variable terminal or subterminal band, relative
length 13.4%, arm ratio 0.73.  Chromosome 5: distinct centromeric band
and banded satellite at short arm, relative length 19.4%, arm ratio
0.52.  In Figure 1 the trisomic chromosome is drawn on the right in
karyotypes g-k.  The supernumreary was identified as a chromosome 4.
Figure 2 shows a Giemsa C-stained root tip metaphase and interphase
nucleus of standard line Col-O(a,b) and of a trisomic plant (progeny
of trisomic line T-20) (c,d).<p>

There were some minor differences in banding patterns within lines: in
karyotypes of T-20 a heteromorphic and both homomorphic forms with
respect to the occurrence of a terminal band in chromosome 4 were
found.  Small but significant differences in Giemsa banding seem to
exist also between lines. Chromosome 4 of Col-O had frequently a
terminal band at the long arm, and in chromosome 5 the satellite was
somewhat larger than in chromosome 5 of T-20.  Preliminary tests with
other lines showed that the width of the centromeric band in
chromosomes 1 and 2 may also be subjectd to variations.  In all lines
investigated endopolyploid nuclei (estimated DNA contents: about 8C or
16C) were observed in differentiated tissues of the root, but there
may also be racial differences and it seemed that endopolyploidy was
more frequent in Col-O than in other lines tested.<p>

From the above observtions it seems likely that the cytological
identification of all trisomics is feasible and that it will be
possible to associate among trisomics each phenotypic group with
trisomy for a particular chromosome (see: STEINITZ-SEARS, 1963,
ROBBELEN and KRIBBEN, 1966).<p>

Work in progress includes also fluorochrome studies which will
possibly allow a further characterisation of heterochromatin in
Arabidopsis thaliana.<p>
