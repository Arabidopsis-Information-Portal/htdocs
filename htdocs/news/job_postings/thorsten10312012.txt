Faculty of Natural Sciences and Technology 
Department of Biology 

Postdoctoral position in Plant Molecular Biology (plant cell wall integrity 
maintenance) 



A two-year postdoctoral fellowship is available in the research group of 
associate professor Thorsten Hamann at the Department of Biology. 
The research group is interested in the mode of action of the plant cell 
wall integrity maintenance mechanism. For further information please check: 
Wormit et al., Plant Physiology, 2012; Denness, et al. Plant Physiology, 
2011; Hamann Frontiers in Plant Science, 2012. The project will use 
biochemical, cell biological and molecular methods to characterize cell 
wall damage perception and signal translation in the model plant 
Arabidopsis thaliana. Candidates should have a strong background in plant 
cell biology, molecular plant physiology or plant-pathogen interaction and 
at least one first author publication in a renowned journal. 

Please contact associate professor Thorsten Hamann (email: 
thamann@imperial.ac.uk) for further information about the position.
