POSTDOCTORAL POSITION
Plant-Microbe/Pest Interactions

A postdoctoral position is available starting July 1, 2006, in the department of 
Nematology University of California, Riverside. Our lab studies the signal transduction 
pathway mediated by the tomato gene Mi-1. Mi-1 belongs to the largest class of cloned plant 
resistance genes, and yet is a unique gene because it confers resistance to three distinct 
animals, nematodes, aphids and whiteflies. We are currently using genetic and functional 
genomics approaches to elucidate the Mi-1-mediated resistance.
Qualifications:
Applicant should have a strong background in plant genetics and general molecular biology. 
Also, strong oral and written communication skills in English are mandatory. Experience in 
functional genomics approaches is highly desirable. Prior work with nematodes or insects 
is not required. To apply, please send a cover letter describing research interests, 
a curriculum vitae with detailed description of your research experience, names and 
e-mail addresses of three references to:   isgouhi.kaloshian@ucr.edu

Application deadline is March 1, 2006
