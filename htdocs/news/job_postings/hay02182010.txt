A 3-year BBSRC-funded postdoc position is available at the University of
Oxford starting September 2010.

This project led by Dr Angela Hay aims to understand the genetic basis for
divergence in petal number between two closely related species: Arabidopsis
thaliana, which has a typical crucifer flower with four petals, and
Cardamine hirsuta, which has reduced petal number. This project involves a
combination of developmental and quantitative genetics in the new
experimental system C. hirsuta. Proven research skills and expertise in
genetics and molecular biology are essential, and a background in plant
development is highly desirable. Further particulars may be downloaded from
http://www.plants.ox.ac.uk. Informal enquiries about the project should be
directed to angela.hay@plants.ox.ac.uk.

Applications including curriculum vitae, name and contact details of two
referees and quoting post reference no. AP10002 to be sent to the
Administrator at the Department of Plant Sciences, University of Oxford,
South Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3RB or by email to recruit@plants.ox.ac.uk. The
closing date for applications is noon on Thursday 8th April 2010.
