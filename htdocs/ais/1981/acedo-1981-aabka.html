INTRODUCTION<p>

There is a growing intrest in the use of Arabidopsis to assay
potential mutagens and carcinogens. The Arabidopsis assay is being
developed in our laboratory to be included in the battery of tests
presently in use. The other tests, even the best of them, cannot
detect all mutagens and carcinogens, so there is a need to find other
means to assay the many chemicals that pose a threat to our health and
a hazard to the environment. While the Arabidopsis assay is expected
not to detect all these toxic chemicals either, it is most likely to
detect some compounds that give false negative results with the other
tests. Arabidopsis detects mutagens with about equal efficiency as the
Ames test, and the merits of this assay has been summarized by Redei
et al., (1980). We are now testing 42 chemicals from the Environmental
Protection Agency for mutagenesis in Arabidopsis based on a modified
embryo test first introduced by Muller (1960).<p>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<p>

The assay procedure was described by Redei (1980). Pre-soaked seeds
(24 hours), contained in cloth bags, were treated with different
concentrations of each chemical. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used as
solvent for all chemicals that do not dissolve in water. The seeds
were allowed to stay in the chemical for about 6 hours, then washed
thoroughly in running tap water overnight. A sample washer was
constructed for this purpose so that the different chemicals do not
contaminate each other.<p>

The washed seeds were planted in Pro-Mix soil (Premier Brands Inc.,
New York, N.Y. 10017) in 3-inch deep petri plates, 3.5 inches in
diameter. Good growth is attained if the soil is previously
pasteurized in an oven for 1 hour at 80*degrees*C and cooled to room
temperature. The seeds from the bags are suspended in 5 ml water and
pipetted with Pasteur pipets (tips cut back so as to allow faster
flow) to the medium. The growth condition of the plants, the embryo
analysis, and the computation of the mutation frequency has been
describd earlier (Redei, 1980).<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

The chemicals to be tested were selected from a wide variety of
chemical classes and some of them are established mutagens and
carcinogens whereas others are not. Of the chemicals tested so far,
mutation in Arabidopsis was induced by treatment with azoxybenzene,
methyul azoxymethanol acetate, 2-acetylaminoluorene, 4,4'methylenebis
(2-chloroaniline), o-toluidine, auramine, and benzo (a)pyrene.
1,1,1,-Trichlorethane and 4-acetylaminofluorene which are the
non-carcinogenic counterparts of chloroform and 2-acetylaminofluorene
respectively, also gave mutations in Arabidopsis. No mutation was
induced by sucrose, ascorbic acid, and methionine (Table 1).<p>

From the results so far, it seems that the Arabidopsis assay promises
to be a useful test that can be included in the battery of tests
already in use. The assay, besides being fast and inexpensive can
detect forward mutations at many loci representing presumable a cross
section of the genetic material of other eucaryotes (Redci, 1980). As
such Arabidopsis will be a better tool to detect carcinogens and
mutagens in man, animals and higher plants, than the bacterial tests
where the chemical acts on a much simpler metabolic system. As a
higher plant, Arabidopsis will most easily detect the genetical and
ecological effects of environmental mutagens in other higher platns
that is necessary to be aware of not only in the interest of basic
research but for the maintenance of a stable ecosystem.<p>
