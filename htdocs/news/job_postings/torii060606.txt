Technician/Graduate Research Assistant positions available:
Arabidopsis stomatal developmental and receptor-Kinase signal transduction

Multiple positions for Technicians/Graduate Research Assistants (RA) are available, as early as  Aug/Sep 2006, in 
the Keiko Torii lab at the University of Washington (http://faculty.washington.edu/ktorii) to study receptor-kinase 
signal transduction, organ growth, and stomatal development using Arabidopsis/rice as model systems.  Successful 
applicants will join the active and collaborative research team to work with one of the following projects:

* Molecular cloning and developmental analyses of novel regulators of asymmetric division and stomatal differentiation.
* Expression and functional studies of newly identified ‘master regulatory genes’ of guard cell differentiation.
* Roles of protein degradation during Arabidopsis organ growth
* Interaction of Arabidopsis ERECTA-family receptor kinases with candidate ligand molecules.
* Biochemical mechanisms of ERECTA-family receptor activation and downregulation

Candidates must have a Bachelor degree with GPA3.2 or higher and at least one year of research experience in molecular 
biology, biochemistry, genetics and/or genomics.  We are looking for motivated candidates who start out projects as a 
full-time Technician for 6-12 months, and then apply to the graduate program and continue research as a graduate 
student in the Torii laboratory starting September 2007.  We also welcome those who want to apply for the graduate
 program directly to work with the Torii lab (after rotations).

Two graduate programs, University of Washington Biology Program and University of Washington Molecular and Cellular 
Biology Program will be possible hosts. The following sites describe the application procedure for each graduate program:
