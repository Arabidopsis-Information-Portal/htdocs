MALVAREZ et al. (1965) concluded for barley that cysteamine protects
seeds from ionizing radiation by improving M1-seedling growth and
adult survival, while leaving the frequently of chlorophyll mutations
unchanged.  Recently, BICK and JACKSON (1968) reported a very
effective sulfhydryl compound, via. 1.4-dithiothreitol (DTT), which
when applied to marsupiel leucocyte cultures during X-irradiation,
halves to chromosomal damage (in terms of hits per cell).  We decided
to test DTT, and also BAL (2.3-dimercaptopropanol), on Arabidopsis
(Landsberg-'erecta'), using MULLER's embryotest to score for genetic
effects.  The underlying idea was that the sequence M1-lethality,
M1-sterility, embryonic lethals, chlorophylls, can be roughly
paralleled by a sequence going from gross chromosomal aberrations to
"point" mutations.  It is then hoped that the protective substances
would lead to a more favourable spectrum of the different types of
damage.  Some of our preliminary results (which are not very
promising) are reported here.<p>

Germination tests (on agar): Seeds were treated for 5 hrs with
dilution series of DTT and BAL in deionized water, both anaerobically
(submers) and aerobically (on saturated filterpaper).  DTT (tested up
to 1.2%) gives only a slight germination delay.  BAL, however, gives
between 0.2 and 0.4% a sudden and sharp decrease in germination
percentage (scored at 40 hrs), although final germination (scored at
136 hrs) is not much reduced (however, seedlings are weak).  The toxic
effect was most pronounced under anaerobic conditions.  In tapwater
BAL polymerizes by oxidation (in contrast to DTT), and the decrease in
germination percentage (at 40 hrs) becomes less.<p>

X-ray experiment: In one of our experiments seeds were soaked for 5
hrs on filterpaper (1.2% DTT), X-rayed (430 Rad/min at 30 cm), left
for 2 hrs (still in the sealed Petridishes), rinsed for 5 min and sown
on agar.  As a comparison, a 50 mM EMS-treatment (6 hrs, 24*degrees*C)
was added.  All items in the Table gave germination over 90%.  We
scored survival to seed-set, and (in 2 fruits per plant) resp. number
of ovules, % of ovules non-fertilized and % embryonic lethals (among
ov. fert.).  The experiment suffered from several adversities, a.o.
aphid infestation, resulting in heterogenous embry-development, so
that our data for chlorophylls (notably chlorina's etc.) were not
represenatative.  These have therefore been interpolated from other
experiments. The Table gives the most illustrative comparisons.<p>

       The following points emerge:<p>

1) DTT provides considerable protection against X-rays.  E.g.  with
22.5 kR (a completely lethal dose), DTT gives eeven better survival
than 15 kR without DTT.<p>

2) For sterility and mutations 22.5 kR + DTT happens to give the same
results as 15 kR without DTT.  (The numbers of plants scored were too
small to attach much weight to the difference 4.6 vs. 3.0 for
chlorophylls)<p>

3) From 1) and 2) follows that the only DTT induced "spectrum shift"
between the different categories of damage refers to "survival".
There was not, in going from M1-sterility to M-2 mutations, a
progressive retention of the latter (increase on efficiency), as was
originally hoped for.  Cf.  also 15 kR with 15 kR + DTT.<p>

4) Thus EMS renains by far the more efficient mutagen, as it gives
(see Table) at equal level of M1 -fertilitiy a far higher mutant yield
in M2 (cf. also MESKEN and VAN DER VEEN, 1968).<p>
