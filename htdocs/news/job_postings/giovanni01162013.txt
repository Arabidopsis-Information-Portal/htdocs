M.Res./Ph.D. scholarship research position at Imperial College London on plant root regeneration, 4 years, fully funded 

Description: 
A four-year scholarship (for Master and PhD), part of the Doctoral Training Program funded by BBSRC, is available to study plant root regeneration in the Laboratory of Plant Morphogenesis at Imperial College London. 
The project will study the dynamics of cellular interactions during root regeneration in the plant model system Arabidopsis thaliana, both in optimal and sub-optimal environmental conditions. The general approach will be a combination of available molecular and genetic tools, innovative live imaging techniques and computational modeling. 
Overall, this is an ambitious study at the very edge of plant biology and applied optical physics, aimed at unveiling fundamental mechanisms crucial for root regeneration and resistance to harsh conditions.
