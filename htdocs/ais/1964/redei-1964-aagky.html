Vol 01:<h2>REDEI, G. P.</h2><h2>D-alanine, a specific inhibitor</h2>

The L forms of amino acids usually occur in the tissues but in
general, plants can utilize both enantiomorphs nearly equally.
Alanine is an exception, however.  The L form alone may function as a
poor nitrogen source, and also may slightly promote growth if
inorganic nitrogen is supplemented with it.  D-alanine, however, is a
powerful inhibitor if added to an inorganic nitrogen containing
medium.  The D- alanine inhibition is completely released by L-alanine
and the commercially available D, L-batches behave more or less
identically with the L enantiomorph.<p>

The result of a typical experiment:<p>

No other amino acid fully reverted the inhibition but several allowed
partial release.  A preliminary paper chromatographic test indicated
that Arabidopsis cultured on a medium with D-alanine as the sole N-
source accumulated large amount of free alanine while several other
free amino acids were absent or greatly reduced.  It appears that
D-alanine may be useful in studies of protein synthesis of
Arabidopsis.<p>
