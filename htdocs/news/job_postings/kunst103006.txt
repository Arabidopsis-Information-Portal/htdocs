POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN SURFACE WAX DEPOSITION

 

available at the

 

UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA

 

VANCOUVER, CANADA

 

We are seeking a highly motivated individual interested in the regulation/cell biology of 
surface wax deposition in Arabidopsis. The successful candidate will be involved in one of the 
following projects: 1) Identification and characterization of novel wax-biosynthetic genes 
using genetic screens and gene knockouts, 2) cellular localization of wax biosynthetic enzymes and 
wax secretion, or 3) genetic engineering of wax composition and wax load.  Applicants should 
have proven research skills in molecular biology, with particular emphasis on analysis of plant 
gene expression and molecular genetic manipulation of plants. Experience in plant cell biology, 
especially confocal microscopy of living tissue, cryofixation, immunolocalization, or with 
genetic screens and analysis of Arabidopsis mutants would be advantageous. 

 

The position requires excellent communication skills and is available immediately. Salary will 
be competitive and commensurate with qualification and experience. Interested candidates should 
send a cover letter outlining research experience and interests, a curriculum vitae, and the 
names and contact information of 3 referees to Ljerka Kunst, Department of Botany, University 
of British Columbia, 6270 University Blvd., Vancouver, B.C. V6T 1Z4, Canada; FAX (604) 822-6089; 
e-mail kunst@interchange.ubc.ca.
