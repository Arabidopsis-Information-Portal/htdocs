In Arabidopsis nutritional mutations have been described. Some are
lethal and corresponded to deficiencies in thiazole, pyrimidine or
thiamine. The auxotrophy of the lethal mutants has been cancelled in a
number of cases by treatment with bacterial DNA (Ledoux et al., 1974,
1975).<p>

One of the hypotheses accounting for this result is an integration of
bacterial DNA fragment(s) in the plant genome.<p>

To check this possibility we used the blotting procedure of Southern
(1975). Experimental conditions were as follows:<p>

DNA preparation and treatment: Three to four weeks-old axenic
seedlings were lyophilised and ground to dust in liquid nitrogen.
Pigments and chlorophyll were removed by several treatments with
denatured alcohol. Material was treated with pronase, RNase and
alcohol. A second RNase digestion was followed by a treatment with
proteinase K. DNA precipitated by alcohol is filtered on agarose 4B.
The ENA, eluted at the void volume was dialysed, lyophilised and kept
at -20*degrees*C. Al DNA were digested with Eco R1 or Bam H1
endonuclease following the instructions of the manufacturer
(Boehringer). After digestion, the DNA were electrophorised in 0.8%
agarose (BIO-RAD). After denaturation at pH 12.5-13, the different
fractions were transferred by blotting into a nitrocellulose filter
(Schleicher and Scholl) using the procedure described by Southern
(1975).<p>

32 p probe: Labelling of the bacterial DNA (from &#180;. coli or M.
lysodeikticus) was performed by nick translation following the
procedure of Rigby et al., (1977, Anonym 1980). To obtain a high
specific activity we used the four 32 p dnTP. Specific activities
equal or higher than 5 x 10 7 cpm/micro g DNA were currently obtained.<p>

Filter hybridization: Nitrocellulose filters were transferred to an
hybridization solution containing the 32 p probe which had previously
been denatured at 100*degrees*C for 10 minutes. Filters were
completely submerged in the radioactive solution and the incubation
was performed at 68*degrees*C (in the case of E. coli DNA probe) at
73*degrees*C (for the M. lysodeikticus DNA probe) overnight (16-20
hours).<p>

hybridization with 32 P.M. lysodeikticus probe. The filter treatments
are equal to those in Figure 2 except that the hybridization was
carried out at 73*degrees*C. At right the ethidium bromide stained
gel. Band(s) is present in the 054 channel corresponding to
M.lysodeikticus DNA treated py 431 whilst nothing appears in the 059
(E. coli DNA treated mutant) and wild type channel.<p>

Autoradiography: The filters were washed in unlabelled hybridization
solution, blotted dry and autoradiographed by exposure for 1-7 days at
room temperature to Kodak X-Omat R films used with a Siemens special
superhighspeed intensifying screen.<p>

fragments. Diagrammatic representation of the band by autoradiography
after hybridization with 32 p E. coli DNA probe.<p>

The filters were prehybridized in Denhardt's solution. 32p labelled
probe was added to a concentration of about 3 x 10 6 cpm/ml.
Hybridization was carried out at 68*degrees* overnight (+/-18 hours).
The hybridized filters were washed at 68*degrees* in 3xSSC+SDS, with 5
changes of buffer, before using to expose X-ray film. The column in
the left contains *lambda* DNA cleaved with Eco R1 endonuclease.
059-065-061 are the E. coli DNA treated mutants.<p>

Results obtained with restricted DNA of the seven strains mentioned
above, treated in parallel with the same E. coli 32p DNA probe, reveal
the presence of specific sequences homologous to E. coli in the 061,
059 and 065 strains (all corrected by E. coli DNA) and absence in wild
type, mutant control or in the 054 strain, originally corrected with
M. lysodeikticus 32p DNA.<p>

When the same seven DNA were hybridised with M. lysodeikticus 32p DNA,
homology could only be observed with the 054 strain (Figure 1).<p>

The observed radioactive bands correspond to restricted fragments
having different electrophoretic velocities (Figure 2). These
fragments are now under further analysis.<p>

It should be pointed out that these results were obtained with
progenies of corrected plants, i.e., after several meiosis and growth
cycles. The existance of a real selection pressure might account for
the observed permanence of the foreign DNA sequences.<p>
