Postdoctoral Research Associate, Iowa State University
Postdoctoral associate position is available immediately to join a NSF-PGRP 
funded, multi-disciplinary team at Iowa State University, Ames, IA, investigating 
the mechanisms that regulate long-distance movement of mRNAs in plants. 
Focus is on the identification of RNA-binding proteins that regulate RNA stability, 
movement, and translation repression.  Tuber formation in potato involves the 
delivery of a light-activated mRNA signal from the light-receiving organ, the leaf, 
to an underground organ, the stolon. The overall objective of this project is to 
uncover the network of signals that are responsible for the photoperiod-activated 
induction of tuber formation. There are two areas of research in this study: 1) 
Numerous RNAs of potato are transported via the phloem in a regulated fashion 
in response to internal and external cues and 2) Proteins are present in the 
phloem that facilitate photoperiod-mediated transport, regulate repression of 
translation, affect RNA stability and degradation, and direct the movement of 
RNA to its final destination. Several approaches will be undertaken to identify 
and characterize RNAs and proteins from phloem, including the profiling of RNA 
expression, proteomics, and screening techniques.  Candidates must have a 
strong background in molecular biology and protein biochemistry. The positions 
are for up to 4-yr terms and salary will be commensurate with qualifications.  See

long-distance signaling pathway. Plant Cell 18: 3443, for more details.
