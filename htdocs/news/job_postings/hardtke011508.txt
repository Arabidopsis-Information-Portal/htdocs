A postdoctoral position is available starting immediately or later in the 
lab of Christian Hardtke at the Dept. of Plant Molecular Biology, University 
of Lausanne, Switzerland. Our department offers excellent research 
infrastructure combined with a lively, interactive and international 
scientific community, located in the beautiful Lake Geneva region. 
 
The candidate is expected to build on recent progress in our lab in one of 
various projects that are based on the analysis of natural genetic 
variation. Possible topics include for instance the analysis of the cell 
biological and biochemical functions of BRX family proteins in Arabidopsis 
and other species, or cloning and characterization of rate-limiting factors 
in quantitative aspects of Arabidopsis vascular development. 
 
Strongly motivated candidates with demonstrated expertise in molecular 
techniques are encouraged to apply. Funding for this position is secured for 
two years. However, the successful candidate is expected to apply for 
eligible fellowships. 
 
Please forward applications including a curriculum vitae and contact 
information for two senior scientist referees by e-mail to
