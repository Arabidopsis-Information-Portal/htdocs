POSTDOCTORAL POSITION
A postdoctoral position is available in the laboratory of Dr. Charles Gasser in the Section of Molecular and Cellular Biology at the 
University of California, Davis.

The position is to study the nature and function of a recently identified family of Arabidopsis DNA-binding proteins.  
The BASIC PENTACYSTEINE (BPC) proteins have been shown to bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner and are implicated in participating 
in the expression of a variety of other genes (Meister et al., 2004, Plant J. 37: 426-438).  Analysis of mutants, in vivo and in vitro 
target selection, assessment of gene expression in transgenic plants, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and in vitro and in vivo analysis of 
protein-DNA interactions will be some of the methods that will be used in these studies.  Experience in protein-nucleic acid interactions 
in any system, plant molecular biology, plant developmental genetics, or plant biochemistry are appropriate preparation for this position.  
Those with experience in transcription factor analysis are especially encouraged to apply, but such experience is not a prerequisite for the 
position.

The University of California, Davis provides an excellent environment for the study of plant biology due to a large, diverse and interactive 
community of plant biologists.

To apply, please send current curriculum vitae and contact information for three references via e-mail to csgasser@ucdavis.edu. Or for more 
information contact Dr. Gasser by e-mail or by phone at (530) 752-1013.
