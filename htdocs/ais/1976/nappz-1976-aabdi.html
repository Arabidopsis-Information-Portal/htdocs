Arabidopsis thaliana has developed essentially two methods by which
adaptation to seasonally changing external factors is warranted,
namely delay of germination and delay of flower formation, both, of
course, on a genetical basis. The period of June and July, 1976, in
Central Europe that has been extremely hot and dry, has not only
killed numerous therophytes, but also reminded us of the fact that the
course of temperatures and precipitations varies from one year to
another. The adaptation to such oscillations from year to year is
attained by the maintenance of hetrogeneity in most populations with
regard to germination (requirements of light and/or after-ripening),
flowering, or both.<p>

Already in 1964 and 1975 (b) I have reported some observations of
heterogeneity in several Arabidopsis populations of the Rhineland, as
far as germination was concerned, but until now only little
investigations of this kind have been done, and very little
information on the number and mode of action of the genes involved is
available (NAPP-ZINN 1975 a).  In some cases at least, the
germinational behaviour, and particularly the light requirement of
germination, may depend upon the conditions under which the seed had
ripened (table 1).<p>

On the other hand, there are already numerous reports on heterogeneity
within wild populations with regard to flowering (e.g., REDEI 1962: p.
454, NAPP-ZINN 1964, CETL 1965, CTL et al, 1965, JONES 1968 etc.).
More recently some further Arabidopsis populations of the Rhineland
(figure 1) have been subjected to observations of this kind (table 2).
Most of them, even among the early flowering ones, proved to be
heterogenous.  It may be noteworthy that the findings of CETL (1965)
and CETL et al. (1965) about the correlation between altitude and
flowering time of Moravian Arabidopsis populations do not hold true
for the Rhineland.<p>

Arabidopsis thaliana populations used in the investigations reported
here. They correspond to the numbers in the first column of Table 2.<p>

According to CETL et al., winter annual populations are limited to the
warm and dry lowland. At Eberbach monastery, however, a typical
locality of this kind, Arabidopsis populations are strictly summer
annual, while, vice versa, the "cold and wet highland" population of
Schalkenmehren is pronouncedly winter annual. The regions of Grenoble
(France) and Cologne have essentially the same climates
(precipitations 760 and 900 mm per year, distributed all over the
year, average temperatures of +1*degree*C in January and of
19*degrees*C in July), but quite contrasting Arabidopsis populations.
(It will be evident that Grenoble climatically belongs to Central
Europe and not to the Mediterranean area; for the latter see RATCLIFFE
1965).  At Limburg, LAIBACH's working place and birthplace of a dozen
of summer annual Arabidopsis strains, I discovered a population with
almost exclusively winter annual descendants.  Therefore, it is
becoming increasingly indispensable to take into account both
germination and flowering behaviour in order to understand the
mechanisms of adaptation (cf. NAPP-ZINN 1964, RATCLIFFE 1965).<p>

flowering: 17 Arabidopsis populations, chiefly from the Rhineland. The

generations; # = standard lines for comparison.<p>

Those alleles which delay the induction of flowering, mostly do so by
calling forth a requirement of vernalization.  Under consideration of
those mutants which had been obtained by ROBBELEN (1957) and McKELVIE
(1962), meanwhile already > 10 loci of vernalization genes are known;
but descendances from crosses of isogenic lines which had been
isolated from populations of distant geographic origin, lead to the
conclusion that in wild populations always the same few loci are
concerned. So, e.g., the vernalization gene Fri, found in the rate
Stockholm for the first time (NAPP-ZINN 1957 a), seems to be identical
with the main vernalization gene of the line III 18 (from a locality
near Altenahr, Rhineland; cf. NAPP-ZINN 1964) and of the race Zurich
(cf. NAPP-ZINN 1957 b, etc.).<p>
