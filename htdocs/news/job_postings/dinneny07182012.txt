POSTDOCTORAL POSITION AVAILABLE 
Carnegie Institution for Science, Department of Plant Biology 
  
A postdoctoral position will be available in September, 2012 in the Dinneny lab at the 
Carnegie Institution for Science, Department of Plant Biology. Our lab is interested 
in the mechanisms governing the response of roots to environmental stress. Two 
positions are available to work on a new pioneering project to develop a tissue-
specific, high-resolution understanding of root biology in the model grass species, 
Setaria viridis. I am particularly interested in applicants who have experience and 
interest in working with transcriptional networks and RNA-Seq data as well as those 
interested in developmental biology and stress physiology. 
  
Applicants are expected to have a strong publication track record, exhibit a creative 
scientific approach in their work and enjoy collaborative interactions. Interested 
applicants should send their cover letter and CV with contact information for 3 
references to José Dinneny (dinneny@stanford.edu). Please include in the cover letter 
a description of your research interests and career goals. The position will initially 
be available for 1 year with renewal of up to 5 years based on performance.
