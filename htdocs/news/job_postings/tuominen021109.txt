A postdoc position at Umeå Plant Science Centre on xylem formation 

The post doc project deals with programmed cell death of xylem elements in the vascular 
tissues of plants and its impact on wood formation in forest trees (c.f. Moreau et al., Genome 
Biology 6/4/R34; Moreau et al., Plant J. published online: Dec 16 2008). The aim of the 
project is to focus on the function of a metacaspase protein in the control of cell death of 
xylem elements using various molecular techniques such as reverse and forward genetics in 
Arabidopsis thaliana as well as molecular and genetic approaches in forest trees. To qualify 
for the position, the applicant should have a recent PhD degree. The requested experimental 
skills include a solid background in molecular biology. Experience of microscopic techniques 
is a merit. Good social skills, ability to work independently as well as in collaboration with 
others and good skills in English language are valued. 
The position is placed in Sweden at Umea University at the department of Plant Physiology, 
which is a part of Umea Plant Science Centre (www.upsc.se). UPSC is a vibrant and 
international research centre within plant and forest experimental biology and biotechnology 
located in Umea, which is the capital of northern Sweden. Umea is an attractive university 
town with rich academic, cultural and outdoor activities. 

This is a full-time position for two years with an annually renewable contract. The salary is 27 
000 SEK (gross) per month. 

Applicants should submit CV, a statement of previous research achievements, a research plan 
for the project, a publication list and contact information of two to three references. 

Your complete application should be sent to Hannele Tuominen
