POSTDOCTORAL POSITION AT UT AUSTIN 

A postdoctoral fellow position is available for three years to work on the 
phytochrome-interacting basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors 
(PIFs) that are involved in regulating photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis. 
The research involves understanding the mechanisms of PIF functions in 
photomorphogenesis using biochemical, genetic and genomic approaches. 
Applicants should have a recent Ph.D. in molecular genetics and/or 
biochemistry. Prior experience in Arabidopsis is advantageous but not 
essential. Salary and benefits will be competitive and commensurate with 
experience. Interested applicants should send a CV, brief summary of 
research experience, and names and email addresses of at least three 
referees preferably by email to huq@austin.utexas.edu<mailto: 
huq@austin.utexas.edu>. 

The University of Texas at Austin is an affirmative action, equal 
opportunity employer committed to excellence through diversity.
