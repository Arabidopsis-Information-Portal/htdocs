<h2> Isoenzyme variability in Arabidopsis thaliana</h2><p>

With the purpose to initiate developmental genetic studies with
Arabidopsis mutants, we have prospected for enzyme polymorphism by
means of electrophoretic techniques.  Since isozymes provide a unique
opportunity to look at gene activity throughout the development of a
plant and as, to date, genetic studies of enzymes in higher plants
have been almost confined to maize, it seems worthwhile to report some
preliminary results on isozymes in Arabidopsis.<p>

This report deals with two enzymes, acid phosphatase (AP) and leucine
amino peptidase (LAP), which are made visible after electrophoresis on
starch gel (SMITHIES, 1955) by specific histochemical stains.  The
gels were immersed in a solution containing for AP, 15 ml of 0.2 M
acetate buffer, pH 4.7; Fast Garnet GBC 150 mg; alpha -naphtyl acid
phosphate 150 mg and distilled water to 150 ml; for LAP,
1-leucyl-alpha-naphtylamide 43 mg, 15 ml of 0.2 M acetate buffer, pH 6.0;
Fast Garnet GBC 150 mg and distilled water to 150 ml.<p>

In this study, plant material was homogenized weight per volume in 0.1
M Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, including 5.10 E-4 M. dithiothreitol and
centrifuged at 17,000 g, 15 min to remove cell debris. For
electrophoretic analyses of individual plants, the crude extract of
2-4 rosette leaves obtained by squashing them with a drop of buffer,
was directly adsorbed onto the filter paper sections to be inserted in
the starch gels. By the last method, it is possible to detrmine the
genotype of a plant and still to keep the latter for further
experiments.  All operations were performed at 4*degrees*C.<p>

Figure 1: Schematic zymogram from rosette leaves of various
geographical races of Arabidopsis.  I Electrophoretic patterns of acid
phosphatase.  Races type A: Zu-O, 232.  Races type B: Wi-2, St-O,
Tsu-O, Pa-1, Stw-O, Ost-O, Bl-1, Mr-O, Ei-5, Te-O, Je-O, Pi-O, Ct-1.
Races type C: Chi-O, Wa-1, Rschw-O, Kn-O, In-O, Gie-O, Rou-O, Hi-O.
II Electrophoretic patterns of leucin aminopeptidase with the 1'
variant in An-1 and the heterozygote with Wi-2 which represents the
standard type.  Note the absence of hybrid enzyme in the heterozygote.
O denotes the origin, + the anode.<p>

The results obtained for AP are shown diagrammatically in Figure 1,I.
Three main types of electrophoretic pattern have been observed.  Other
more anodal faint bands are not taken into account here. The various
geographical races of Arabidopsis are more or less equally distributed
among type B and type C, but type A is only represented by two
populations, Zu-O and 232 (originated from an original St-O stock).
The genetic control of the multiple band pattern is now studied.  F1
data give a summation of the parental bands.  As for developmental
aspects, we have noted in the case of Wi-2, the absence of the two
first cathodal bands in roots and the appearance of new cathodal bands
in extracts of dry seeds.<p>

Leucine aminopeptidase shows two main zones of activity, represented
in Figure 1,II.  Among thirty-one races tested, only one variant has
been detected in the race An-1.  It is characterized by a slower
migration of the more anodal band. The three parental bands are
present in F1 plants, without formation of a hybrid enzyme between 1
and 1'forms.  Absence of interaction between subunits produced by
different alleles has been reported for LAP in Drosophila (BECKMAN and
JOHNSON, 1964) and Zea mays (BECKMAN et al., 1964). The hypothesis
"one gene with two codominant alleles" is now under experimentation.
LAP main bands were found to have a relatively homogenous distribution
in the major organs of the plant.  Seeds were however characterized by
a supplementary, more anodal, band. This search for enzyme
polymorphism is being extended to include esterases, peroxidases and
various dehydrogenases.  It is interesting to note that among
populations of plants grown from the original Laibach collection of
races, no intravariation has been so far observed.<p>
