Recently we reported (OOSTINDIER, 1969) a chlorate resistant mutant of
A. thaliana.  Further investigations showed that the resistance is due
to one recessive gene (chl-1).  Two more chlorate resistant mutants
were isolated.  Here too resistance proved to be recessive and
monogenic (genes tentatively named chl-2 and chl-3). Crosses between
the mutants showed complementation between chl-2 and chl-1, resp.
chl-3, and no complementation between chl-1 and chl-3.<p>

We also reported that the extracts of chl-1 chl-1 seedlings, grown on
solution A (ammoniumnitrate as nitrogen source) or D (nitrate as only
nitrogen source) have a rather high level of nitrate reductase
activity compared with wildtype. The same is the case with extracts of
chl-3 chl-3 seedlings, but chl-2 has a quite different effect:
extracts of chl-2 chl-2 seedlings have a much lower level of nitrate
reductase activity than wildtype. Furthermore, it was found that chl-2
chl-2 seedlings stop growing on solution D at the stage of two small
rosette-leaves, while wildtype, chl-1 chl-1, and chl-3 chl-3 go on
growing on D very well. This supports the idea that it is possible
to isolate mutants with a low nitrate reductase content by means of
selection for chlorate resistance, as has been done with
microorganisms (AXOULAY et al., 1969; GUEST, 1969; STOUTHAMER,
1967a,b).<p>

Results of experiments on chlorate uptake by chl-1 chl-1 plants
suggest that the resistance to chlorate here depends on a lower uptake
of chlorate ions. The production of active nitrate reductase in
wildtype plants is induced by nitrate. Further experiments with chl-2
chl-2 plants will have to reveal whether the low nitrate reductase
activity in these plants is due to low uptake of nitrate, a change in
the regultory system, or a mutation in a structural gene for nitrate
reductase.<p>
