At the Linnean Center of Plant Biology in Uppsala a postdoc position is 
available to study epigenetic mechanisms controlling seed development. 
Anticipated start of the position is March/April 2013. 



Main focus of the project is to investigate epigenetic mechanisms in the 
endosperm causing interploidy and interspecies hybridization failure, which 
will involve the identification and characterization of mutants, 
application of next generation sequencing technologies, and epigenome 
profiling. 



Applicants should have a solid background in molecular biology and 
genetics; skills and interest in bioinformatics are desired but not 
essential. Candidates with a strong interest in epigenetics are especially 
encouraged to apply. 


Our laboratory (http://www.slu.se/ckohler) is part of the Uppsala BioCenter 
at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences ( 
http://www.slu.se/en/faculties/nl/about-the-faculty/cluster/uppsala-biocenter/) 
and the Linnean Center of Plant Biology in Uppsala (http://lcpu.se/). 

The project is funded by the ERC (European research Councel) for initially 
2 years with possibility of extension. 

Applications, including CV, a description of research experiences, a 
statement of scientific interests as well as contact information of two to 
three referees should be submitted by e-mail to: claudia.kohler@slu.se. 

The deadline for applications is January 31, 2013.
