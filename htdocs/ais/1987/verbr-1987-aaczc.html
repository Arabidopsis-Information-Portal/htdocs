INTRODUCTION<p>

Proline accumulates in a range of plant species in response to a
variety of stresses (salt, drought, low temperatures) (Stewart and
Larher, 1982). Such often observed accumulation has been considered by
some authors as an adaptive response. The beneficial effect againt
stress has been attributed to proline acting as a compatible osmotic
solute (Treichel, 1975), as a stabilizing or solubilizing factor for
proteins (Schobert, 1978), as a sink of reduced nitrogen and carbon
(Tully, 1979) or as a component of stress-proteins (Ericson, 1984).
Another interpretation consists in considering proline accumulation as
a stress consequence following protein degredation and inhibition of
proline catabolism (Stewart, 1977).<p>

The controversy about the role of proline in stress could be
approached by mutants which overproduce proline under nonstressed
conditions. This approach has already been used in barley plants by
Kueh and Bright (1981, 1982, 1984).<p>

Mutants showing variation in proline content are also useful tools for
studying proline metabolism, still poorly understood in plants.<p>

Such mutants can be isolated by screening for resistance to proline
analogues such as azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (AZC) and
trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline (HYP). Resistance to HYP or AZC appeared
already to be the result of the overproduction of proline in bacteria
(Czonka, 1981), animals (Lodato, 1984), and plants (Widholm, 1975;
Kueh and Bright, 1982; Cella, 1982).<p>

AZC is a naturally occurring amino acid in some species of the
Liliaceaea that competes with proline for the incorporation into
protein and inhibits growth. This inhibition is attributed to AZC
containing inactive proteins (Fowden, 1963). AZC is also suggested to
act as a false-end product on proline biosynthesis.<p>

HYP arises in proteins by the hydroxylation of protein-bound proline
(Adams and Frank, 1980) and seems to play a key role in cell wall
glycoproteins. Free HYP may inhibit the proline synthesis from
glutamate in maize roots (Oaks et al., 1970) and is also suggested to
inhibit the hydroxylation of protein bound proline (Vaughan and
Cusens, 1973).<p>

In the present report we describe the isolation and the first
characterization of A. thaliana mutants resistant to HYP or AZC.<p>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<p>

* Arabidopsis thaliana race Bensheim (Be-O) was used for all
experiments.<p>

* The mutagenic treatment and selection procedure were performed
according to Cattoir-Reynaerts et al., 1981.<p>

* Selective media included the mineral medium as described by Feenstra
(1964) with 2% glucose added. Inhibitors amino acids were filter
sterilized and added to the autoclaved basal medium. As growth
inhibitors were used trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline (HYP) (SIGMA) and
azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (AZC) (SIGMA).<p>

* Resistance tests and amino acid analysis were performed according to
Vernaillen et al. (1985)<p>

RESULTS<p>

1. Effect of proline analogues on the growth of A. thaliana<p>

A. thaliana seeds were sown on a range of HYP (0-2mM) and AZC
(0-0.2mM) concentrations. For these ranges, inhibition curves from
normal to zero growth were obtained. As apparent from Figure 1, AZC is
the most effective inhibitor and for both analogues inhibition is
particularly expressed in roots. Analogues did not appear to have an
effect on the germination itself.<p>

2. Relief of inhibition by proline and other amino acids<p>

A. thaliana plants were grown on media in which the analogue was
present at "zero growth" concentration. The amino acids we wanted to
test for their reversion effect were supplemented at different
concentrations. Beside the natural amino acid, methionine and arginine
were considered because they were shown to have a slight reversion
effect on HYP and AZC inhibition (Kueh and Bright, 1981). Results are
summarized in Figure 2. Growth inhibition by both analogues are
reversed specifically by proline at low concentrations and to a lesser
extent in roots. Inhibition relief by met and arg is very slight and
occurred marginally.<p>

3. Isolation of mutants resistant to HYP and AZC<p>

Using the method described by Cattoir-Reynaerts et al. (1981), we have
screened for resistance of M 2 seeds to proline analogues chosen at
"zero growth" concentration: +/- 135,000 seeds were sown on HYP 2mM
and +/- 125,000 on AZC 0,15mM. 52 plantlets were found to be resistant
and were cultivated further. They were retested in M 3 generation. 3 M
3 progenies proved to be resistant: one (RP07) to HYP and two (RP14 -
RP18) to AZC. The others were either sensitive or only slightly more
resistant than the wild type. All three resistant behaved
heterogenously: they segregated into resistant and sensitive plants.
They were cultivated further and M 4 progenies were retested.
Segregation tests demonstrated that resistance of RP07 is associated
with a dominant nuclear gene. Preliminary data indicate that RP14 and
RP18 are under the control of a semi dominant nuclear gene.<p>

4. Growth characteristics of the mutants<p>

Growth of M 4 progenies that were rather homogenous in segregation
tests, was estimated on a range of analogues concentrations. Data are
summarized in Figures 3 and 4. For the range of concentrations tested,
all the mutants showed better growth than the perental wild type,
although growth inhibition is still marked on roots.<p>

5. Amino acid content of selected mutants<p>

Eight day old plantlets grown on Feenstra medium were extracted to
measure the intracellular pool of free amino acids by using an LKB
Biochrom 401 amino acid analyzer as mentioned in Materials and
Methods. Only one replicate was used. There is only one mutant RP07
that overproduced significantly proline (x3).<p>

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION<p>

Growth effects of two proline analogues AZC and HYP were compared on
A. thaliana. The results show that AZC and HYP inhibit both severely
the growth but AZC is already effective at concentrations 10 x lower
than HYP. Roots are more sensitive to both antimetabolites. HYP and
AZC inhibitors were specifically relieved by proline at low
concentrations. HYP and AZC appeared thus to be suitable selective
agents for the selection of proline-overproducer A. thaliana plants.
If, as suggested, HYP and AZC have different mechanisms of action,
different kinds of mutants could be possibly isolated.<p>

The selection exerted on the development of M 2 seeds from the progeny
of EMS treated M 1 seeds led to the isolation of three resistant
plants: RP07 to HYP, RP14 and RP18 to AZC.<p>

Transmission of the resistance trait was investigated by selfing the
obtained resistant plants. Segregation data suggest that the resitance
of RP07 is associated with a dominant nuclear gene while our
conclusions are still preliminary for RP14 and RP18. When grown on a
concentration range of analogue, the mutants appeared to be more
resistant than the parental wild type, and this for a concentration
tested.<p>

Under normal growth conditions, the soluble proline content of the
mutant RP07 was increased by 3 fold and is probably the cause of HYP
resistance. The proline content of mutants RP14 and RP18 were about
the same as that observed with the parental wild type. Preliminary
data at the permeability level indicate that proline uptake was
reduced in RP107, maybe as a consequence of increased internal proline
concentrations. No differences were found for the other two mutants.<p>
