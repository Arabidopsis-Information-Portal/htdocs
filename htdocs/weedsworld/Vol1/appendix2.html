<H2>Promoter tagging construct pMOG553</H2>

pMOG553 was constructed as follows: a gusA intron gene linked to a 35S CaMV terminator (Vancanneyt et al. 1990 Mol. Gen. Genet. 220;245-250) was fused to synthetic oligomers harbouring the octopine right border and octopine overdrive sequences from which all stop codons were removed. This cassette was transferred as an EcoRI-BglII fragment into pMOG22 (Goddijn <I>et al</I> Plant J.<B>4</B>, 863-873) <P>

The complete sequence for the entire BglII fragment will be available early 1995 through the Nottingham Stock Centre and EMBL. The sequence around the right border is:
