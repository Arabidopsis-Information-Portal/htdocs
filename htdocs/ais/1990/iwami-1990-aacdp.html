There are intensive works on plant regeneration and proliferation from
in vitro culture of Arabidopsis thaliana (FELDMANN and MARKS, 1986;
GLEDDIE, 1989, HUANG and YEOMAN, 1984; LLOYD et al., 1986; VALVEKENS
et al., 1988). However, effective protocols available for all ecotypes
or races have not yet been established, probably because of the
differences in morphogenetic responses between ecotypes to the plant
hormones and/or nutrient media. This problem limits the use of A.
thaliana for various researches in molecular biology.<p>

We have tried to regenerate whole plants from callus of race Landsberg
(erecta) which is one of the most important strain of molecular
biology because of its shorter life cycle and abundant characterized
mutants among A. thaliana ecotypes.<p>

In this paper, we attempted to have a protocol for regeneration and
proliferation of fertile plants from callus tissues with high
efficiency and within short period of time available for this useful
strain of A. thaliana.<p>

As preliminary experiments, leaf-, stem- and root-explants of
Landsberg (erecta) strain were compared with respect to regeneration
capacity from callus tissues according to the protocol described by
FELDMANN and MARKS (1986). Both the leaf- and stem-explants
regenerated a small number of shoots (2-5 shoots per explant) from cut
surfaces, and rooted from the shoots with reduced number, although
induced calli grew rather vigorously. In contrast, root-explants
regenerated a number of shoots from every part of them, and the
regenerated shoot had a high capacity of rooting. This result is
similar to that demonstrated by VALVEKENS et al. (1988). Therefore, we
have used root-explants for regeneration experiments.<p>

Seeds of Landsberg (erecta) strain were surface sterilized (for 10
minutes in 20% sodium hypochlorite solution v/v) and placed
aseptically in plastic culture boxes on a hormone-free solidified
(GELLAN GUM, 0,2% w/v) medium that contained MURASHIGE and SKOOG's
(MS) (1962) mineral salts, microelements and vitamins supplemented
with 2% (w/v) sucrose. They were vernalized for 4 days at 5*degrees*C
in a 16h light/8h dark cycle. The same growth-room conditions were
used for tissue culture procedures with callus-inducing medium (CIM),
shoot-inducing medium (SIM) and root-inducing medium (RIM).<p>

Table 1 shows the culture media that were optimum for callus
induction, shoot- and root-regeneration from root explants. The
hormones supplied to the media were borrowed from VALVEKENS et al.
(1988) for CIM, and from FELDMANN and MARKS (1986) for SIM. The
important improvements are (1) the concentrations of the major and
minor elements of all the three media were diluted into one-half
strength, (2) the culture media consisted of MS for major elements and
B5 for minor elements and vitamins, and (3) GELLAN GUM was used
instead of agar to solidify the culture media.<p>

A root segment (ca. 3 cm in length) excised from 2 week-old plants was
placed on CIM for 4 days. This period of time for callus induction is
important, because shorter inducing period reduces callus formation
but longer inducing period reduces shoot formation. It was transferred
to SIM. A number of callus clusters were formed throughout root axis,
and root hairs covered the entire surface after 7 days of SIM
incubation. The first shots were developed from green areas of the
callus after 10 days. After 2-3 weeks on SIM, the callus with
regenerated shoots (ca. 20-30 shoots per root-explant) was transferred
to RIM. The shoots developed numerous roots (from ca. 70% of the
regenerated shoots) within a week on RIM with 0,1 mg/l IBA. IBA is not
necessarily indispensable. Root formation occurred also on IBA-free
medium, although the frequency is lower than that of IBA (0,1 mg/l)
containing medium. At higher IBA concentrations, regenerated roots
were not able to elongate into solid medium, but became hair-like
roots (ca. 5 mm) on the surface of the medium (3,0 mg/l), or they were
suppressed in growth within 1,5 cm (0,3 mg/l).<p>

All the three media were used with one-half strength in major- and
minor-elements of MS and B5, both of which are so high in
concentration that the calli and/or regenerated shoots tend to
degenerate with brownish color.<p>

whole plants from root-explants of Landsberg (erecta) strain of

Rooted shoots on RIM were transferred to ROCK FIBER (RF, NITTOBO Co.
Ltd., Tokyo), which is superior to vermiculite, and supplied with
diluted HYPONEX (6,5N-6P-19K, HYPONEX Corporation, Atranta, USA).
Almost all rooted-shoots flowered and produced seeds.<p>

In conclusion, we propose a protocol for the rapid and efficient
proliferation of whole plants from root-explants of Landsberg (erecta)
strain of A. thaliana (Figure 1). A 3 cm root-explant produces 30 or
more plants. The time required to go from culture of explant to
flowering of regenerated plants is as short as 5 weeks.  Viable seeds
produced by regenerated plants can be harvested within about 9 weeks
after sowing of the parent seeds. Our protocol has improved that by
VALVEKENS et al. (1988), who succeeded in producing regenerated plants
from root-explants of C24 as well as Landsberg strains within 5-8
weeks.<p>
