Session 11: Chromosome Structure and Function.</H1>

<H4>
Chair: Liz Dennis, CSIRO Division of Plant Industry, Canberra 2601, Australia</H4>
<B>email:</B> <A HREF="mailto:liz@pi.csiro.au">liz@pi.csiro.au</A>&nbsp;

<BLOCKQUOTE>The session on Chromosome Structure and Function included talks
on DNA methylation and gene silencing, on transcription factors and on
meiotic mutants. The way in which methylation and transcription factors
may interact in controlling gene expression gives us a new view of the
different ways in which plant processes are controlled. There was also
a related epigenetics workshop that produced useful discussion. Eric Richards
is organising an email network to continue with the discussion in this
exciting area.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>In the session, Liz Dennis opened with a general overview of
the connection between DNA methylation and the loss of gene activity as
was shown early by the studies of the cycling Acs of maize. She also described
more recent work showing that plants with reduced levels of methylation
(either from decreased DNA methylation mutants or transgenic plants carrying
antisense to DNA methyl.transferase genes), showed phenotypic abnormalities
suggesting that disrupting DNA methylation patterns leads to alterations
in development.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Herve Vaucheret described mutants impaired in post transcriptional
transgene silencing and co-suppression. Two loci, <I>sgs 1</I> &amp; <I>sgs
2</I> (<I>suppressor of gene silencing</I>) were defined - when 35S-Nia2
was introduced into the <I>sgs</I> mutants - co-suppression of host Nia
genes was not triggered (0/8), whereas silencing occurred in 100% of cases
when the construct was introduced into wild type plants. The <I>sgs</I>
<I>1</I> &amp; <I>2</I> mutations can also protect against the silencing
of a 35S x 2-Uid gene.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Ortrun Mittelsten-Scheid spoke about release of epigenetic
silencing by transacting mutations. She described selecting for a mutation
that relieved silencing of a hygromycin resistance gene. These mutations
were second site mutations (not in the hygromycin gene) and were transmitted
to progeny. The hygromycin silencing was released by backcrossing to <I>ddm1</I>
mutants but not to antisense methyl transferase mutants.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Jeff Jeddeloh described his work on combining a <I>ddm1-2</I>
mutation with a silenced <I>PA12</I> gene complex. The <I>ddm</I> mutation
affects gene silencing and methylation immediately and progressively suggesting
a model for the effects seen in <I>ddm1</I> inbred lines where phenotypes
can progess over generations and appear cumulative.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Steve Jacobsen presented his data from the novel "<I>Clark
Kent</I>" mutants, which as might be expected, are alleles of <I>SUPERMAN</I>.
Genomic sequencing showed these alleles result from hypermethylation of
the <I>SUPERMAN</I> gene and associated lack of <I>SUPERMAN</I> transcript.
This change in methylation status (some 5% of cytosines are methylated
in the mutant) can be reversed and wild type " revertants " appear. Similar
changes occur in the <I>superman</I> alleles seen in the antisense methyl
transferase lines. The question of a normal role of methylation in the
control <I>SUPERMAN</I> expression was discussed.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The importance of interactions between DNA binding proteins
was emphasized by Karan Singh who discussed his findings with the octopine
sythase element binding proteins (OBFS). He talked about DNA binding proteins
that enhance the binding of other transcription factors such as proteins
that contain Dof domains, which interact with B ZIP binding factors.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Another class of transcription factors which bind to OBFs include
AtERB (ethylene responsive binding protein), which is known to bind to
the GCC box (others in this class are CBF1, AP2 and TINY), but also increases
binding of G box binding factors to the G box.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Finally, Chris Makaroff discussed his characterization of <I>syn1</I>
a synaptic mutant. He presented beautiful pictures of meiosis of both wild
type and mutant plants which suggest synapsis was defective and unpaired
chromosomes persist through the second meiotic division. This technique
will also be important in looking at other mutants altered in meiosis.</BLOCKQUOTE>
