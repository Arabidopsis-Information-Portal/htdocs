<h2>Frequency of forward mutations and reversions in two chlorina-mutants after EMS treatment</h2><p>

	The monogenic chlorina mutants V 81 (ch3) and V 89 (ch4) of Arabidopsis thaliana (race Enkleim, En-2) were induced by mutagenic seed treatment with ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) and diethyl sulfate respectively.  Sown in the greenhouse during January and February without additional illumination they usually develop rather viable plants.  (diameter of the rosette at the beginning of flowering about 2, 5 to 3 cm).  The leaves of V81 show a homogenous deeply yellow colouring up to maturity (cf. ROBBELEN and WEHRMEYER, 1966), those of V89 turn somewhat more greenish at later developmental stages.  Both phenotypes can be distinguished even under chimeric conditions.  Therefore, dormant seeds of homozygous mutants and heterozygous plants were treated with 0.1-0.3% EMS solution (0.1 mol phosphate buffer in bidistilled water, pH 7, 20+/-0.1*degree*C, 24 h, submerged), washed for 1 h in running tap water and sown on soil. From the segregating progenies of heterozygous plants in the case of V89 the heterozygous individuals could be selected before being transplanted by their more bright green leaf colour.  With V 81 all of the green plants had to be grown and their hetrozygosity proved in a progeny test.<p>

	The EMS induced leaf sectoring was registered several times during the development of the rosette.  Green spots or sectors were recognized on the yellow leaves of both mutant types, and yellowish, but also white sectors were determined on the green leaves of the heterozygotes:<p>

	Quite a lot of yellow sectors in the heterozygotes had just the same colour as the homozygous mutant.  Some of these sectors reached the inflourescence zone. The seeds produced in this area were separately harvested and sown. But from a total of 678 M2-progenies from these sectors only 5 contained mutants which phenotypically were identical with the original strain. The rest of all was more or less deviating. Thus most of the yellowish sectors in the treated heterozygous rosettes seem not to be produced by true forward mutations from +ch/ch to ch/ch, but by genetic changes at other loci.  Test crosses have been initiated in order to elucidate the nature of the observed changes.  (For similar experiments cf. GICHNER and VELEMINSKY, 1965).<p>

	Just so the green sectors on the yellow mutant rosettes proved to give rise to M2-plants which in all of the tested 26 progenies were different from the normal green wild type.  There were no true backmuations, but only phenotypical reversions; most of the offsprings were lighter green and frequently changed in some other morphological or physiological characteristics. For genetic analyses crosses have been performed with these reverted types to the wild strain.<p>
