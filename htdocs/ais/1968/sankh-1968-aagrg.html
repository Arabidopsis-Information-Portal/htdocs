Morphactins (certain derivatives of fluorine -9-carboxylic acid)
represent a new class of recently characterised growth regulators
(SCHNEIDER, 1964).  These compounds resemble other growth retardants
(CCC, Phospon, B-995 etc.,) in their overall growth retarding
activity.  However, whereas the growth effects of the latter chemicals
are frequently mediated through inhibition of gibberellin biosynthesis
in the treated plants (NINNEMANN et al., 1967).  Recently, we observed
an apparent antagonism between morphactin and kinetin during the
germination of lettuce seeds (SANKHLA and SANKHLA, 1967).  Since
generally the response to growth retardants is extremely specific and
is known to differ in various cultivars of the same species (CATHEY,
1964), it was thought worthwhile to extend the above observation on
another plant.  Results relating to the effect of
morphactin-butylester, alone and in combination with kinetin,
6-benzylaminopurine and zeatin, are presented in this report.<p>

Seeds of A. thaliana, En-2, (harvested 1966) were germinated at
25*degrees*C in the presence of various concentrations of the above
mentioned growth substances. During the germination period the seeds
received a light intensity of about 1000 lux for 16 hrs a day.
Details of the experimental procedure have already been reported
previously (SANKHLA and SANKHLA, 1968).<p>

As in lettuce (SANKHLA and SANKHLA, 1967) morphactin proved to be a
potent inhibotor of seed germination also in Arabidopsis (table).  Not
only this, but all the cytokinins tested (kinetin,
6-benzylaminopurine, and zeatin) successfully reversed the inhibitory
effect of morphactin on seed germination.  In order of effectiveness
zeatin appeared to be the superior.<p>

There are several evidences (see SANKHLA and SANKHLA, 1967, 1968)
which suggest that, since cytokinins can effectively overcome the
inhibitory effect of a variety of both synthetic as well as naturally
occurring growth inhibitors and growth retardants, it might be
possible that both, endogenous cytokinins and inhibitors interact in
bringing about growth and senescence.  However, it should be borne in
mind that often plants are capable of 'adding' or 'subtracting'
entirely unrelated effects and hence the visual perception of results
might not necessarily represent a true and genuine interaction between
the growth substances that are being tested.  This view appears to
hold true especially for the process of seed germination, since there
is no way of measuring the steady state of this process as a whole.<p>
