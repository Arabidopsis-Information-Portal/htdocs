Postdoctoral Position: Building FRET-based biosensors to study MAP kinase signaling in Arabidopsis 

A 2-year NSF funded postdoctoral position is available immediately in the laboratory of Patrick Krysan 
in the Genome Center of Wisconsin at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The project focuses on 
building genetically-encoded FRET-based biosensors to measure MAP kinase activity in Arabidopsis. 
These biosensors will be used in conjunction with confocal microscopy to study the spatial and temporal 
dynamics of MAP kinase activation in living Arabidopsis seedlings in response to biotic and abiotic 
stresses. 

Qualified candidates should have experience with in vitro biochemical methods including recombinant 
protein purification from E. coli, in vitro kinase assays, and plasmid construction. Experience working 
with Arabidopsis or other plant systems is not required. 

Applicants should email a single .pdf file to Dr. Krysan, krysanlab@gmail.com , containing the following 
information: cover letter, c.v., brief statement of research interests and career goals, and the names 
and contact information for three references. Review of applications will begin immediately and continue 
until the position is filled. More information about the Krysan lab can be found at the lab website:

address listed above.
