The antibiotic Actinomycin D. is known to inhibit irreversibily and
specifically DNA-dependent RNA synthesis in animal cells at a
concentration of about 0.04 microg/ml.  Recent studies have indicated
that to obtain the same results with plant cells the concentration of
Actinomycin D. has to be increased to at least 10 micro g/ml.  LANGE
and MOHR (1956) have shown that Actinomycin D. at the concentration of
10 micro g/ml blocks the synthesis of anthocyanin in Sinapis alba
seedlings.  McCALLA and ALLAN (1964) using Actinomycin D at a
concentration of 30 micro g/ml were able to inhibit the chlorophyll
development of Euglena viridis.<p>

Preliminary tests had indicated that concentrations of at least 15
micro g/ml were necessary to prevent the germination of Arabidopsis
thaliana.  An experiment was carried out in a Sherer growth chamber at
22*degrees*C under 24 hr full illumination (2500 foot candle).  Seeds
of the variety Estland (graciously sent to the author by Dr. LANGRIDGE
were germinated on minimal medium (VELEMINSKY and GICHNER, 1964) in
200 mm test tubes (one seed per tube).  On medium in which 20 micro g
of Actinomycin were added the seeds were unable to germinate.  Only in
3 tubes out of 30 they were able to swell and a greenish cast
appeared.  Observation under the dissecting scope indicated that in
those cases the radicle elongated to only one eighth of a centimeter
before growth stopped; but the cotyledons had enlarged and turned
light green.<p>

This experiment which was repeated 4 times seems to indicate that it
requires 20 micro g/ml of Actinomycin D to prevent the germination of
A. thaliana.  Further experiments are now being carried out to find
the concentration of Actinomycin D at which the seedlings are unable
to grow after they successfully germinated in minimal medium.<p>
