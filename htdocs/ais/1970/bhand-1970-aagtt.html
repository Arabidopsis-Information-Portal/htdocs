In our earlier studies (BHANDARKAR and GAUR, 1967) we have reported
delayed germination and retarded growth of Arabidopsis thaliana
seedlings in heavy water (D20).  It has been frequently observed that
seed germination time is reduced by gibberellin treatment (STOWE and
YAMAKI, 1957).  KUCERA (1966) and REINHOLZ (1967) have shown that the
inhibition of germination in Arabidopsis seeds by ionizing radiation
could be nullified by post-radiation application with gibberellic acid
(GA).  In the present study it was aimed to examine whether GA is
effective in overcoming the D20-induced delay in germination of
Arabidopsis seeds.<p>

The material and culturing techniques were the same as those employed
in our previous experiment (BHANDARKAR and GAUR, 1967) with minor
modification viz., the medium was devoid of sucrose. While the growth
medium was autoclaved, the GA was sterilized by passing the solution
through a millipore filter (22 m micro pore size).  D20 and GA
concentrations varied over 25 to 100% and 2.5 x 10E-6 to 2.5 x 10 E-2M
range, respectively. The time taken to attain 100% germination
(radical appearance) was used as criterion of the treatment effect.<p>

Compared to the water control, a delay of about 144 hours in
germination was brought about by 50% D20 (Table 1). While GA
concentrations up to 2.5 x 10 E-3M stimulated germination both in
water and D20, 2.5 x 10 E-2M proved completely inhibitory. This
stimulation represented a 2-phase effect, characteristic of the action
of hormone concentration. GA was found optimum in a concentration of
2.5 x 10 E-5M hastening germination by about 26 and 96 hours in H20
and 50% D20, respectively.<p>

Table 2: Time (hours) taken to obtain 100% seed germination in the
preence and absence of 2.5 x 10E-5M gibberellic acid (GA) and of
various D20 concentrations.<p>

In Table 2 a concentration dependent delay in germination can be seen
induced by D20.  While the percent of germination was unaffected up to
50% D20, higher concentrations completely prevented germination, at
least up to 10 days.  On the other hand, the presence of 2.5 x 10 E-5M
GA not only hastened the germination up to 50% D20; but also its
relative effect increased with increasing D20 concentrations.
Further, GA brought about as much as 52% germination in the
presence of 75% D20.  There was, however, no germination in 100% D20
even with application of GA.<p>

The current investigation shows that the seeds sown for a prolonged
period in D20, followed a slackened rate of germination.  The reports
on D20 effect on some of the germination factors viz., seed hydration
and seed respiration (BHATTACHARYA et al., 1969), RNA synthesis (GROSS
and HARDING, 1961; GROSS et al., 1964), and cell division (GROSS and
SPINDEL, 1960) reveal the inhibitory action of the deuterium. The GA
application to seeds treated with D20 might have acted collectively on
any one or more of these processes responsible for germination.  It is
known that GA improves the hydration level in H20 (STOWE and YAMAKI,
1957) as well as in D20 soaked seeds (BHANDARKAR et al., 1970).  Also
it promotes RNA and protein synthesis (BROUGHTON, 1969) and cell
elongation (SACHS, 1965).  This may explain the overcoming of the
D20-induced delay in germination by GA.<p>
