Post Doctoral fellows in the epigenetic basis of Hybrid Vigour

Hybrid vigour is a well known and widely used phenomenon in agriculture but the molecular basis is 
not understood. We are using next generation sequencing to investigate the genome wide changes in 
epigenetic marks that occur when hybrids are formed to determine whether epigenetic changes control 
heterosis. The Postdoctoral Fellows would work as part of a group led by Liz Dennis and Jim Peacock 
and including bioinformaticists, three other Postdoctoral Fellows and two technicians. We are seeking 
two skilled molecular biologists committed to this area, possibly experts in epigenetics.
