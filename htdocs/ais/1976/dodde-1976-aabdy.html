One of the major complications in the study of active uptake of
nitrate in intact plants is the rapid conversion of transported
substrate upon entrance into the symplast. Various solutions have been
tried by means of different methods, e.g., by inhibiting the nitrate
reductase (NaR), one of the enzymes responsible for the metabolism of
nitrate (Heimer et al., 1969), by cutting off the shoot, since in most
of the plants the reduction of nitrate takes place in the shoot, or by
working with plants in which no NaR had been induced (Jackson et al.,
1972).<p>

In microorganisms some other methods have proven to be very useful.
The study of the uptake of various substances in membrane vesicles,
derived from bacteria, gives much information about the uptake
mechanisms in these organisms (Kaback, 1972; Konings and Freese,
1972).  By studying uptake in mutants with a genetic block in the
metabolism of the transported substrate, information was obtained
about the uptake process as well as about the genetic regulation of
uptake (Stouthamer, 1967; Lo et al., 1972; Bisschop et al., 1975).<p>

Uptake studies in higher plants, with the help of mutants, have never
been performed before. They have become possible, however, since the
work of Oostindier-Braaksma and Feenstra, who, by screening for
chlorate resistance, isolated mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana, which
were disturbed either in the reduction of nitrate or in the uptake of
chlorate (Oostindier-Braaksma and Feenstra, 1973).  Later studies in
our Laboratory showed the uptake mutants to be disturbed in the uptake
of nitrate as well (Doddema et al., 1975). Since this mutant has no
alteration in the NaR-activity, it implies that a mutation has been
induced in a gene playing a role in the control of the uptake of
nitrate.<p>

Experiments were started to investigate the physiological differences
in uptake and reduction of nitrate between the wildtype plants and the
mutants mentioned above: B25 (low NaR) and chl-1 (low NO3 uptake).<p>

Seeds were sown on nutrient agar and after one week the plants were
transferred to a water culture supplied with the necessary nutrients
and grown for another two weeks in conditioned environments (8 hours
light a day; 20-25*degrees*C; 80-90% rel. hum.).  N was provided in
the form of NH4 NO3 in most experiments. After a pretreatment period
of a few days, the uptake of nitrate was measured in two different
ways.  In the first experiments, mentioned below, the uptake was
measured cumulatively by taking samples of the ambient solution at
regular intervals during about 8 hours.  The nitrate concentration was
determined by brucine -H2SO4.  In the second series of expriments the
uptake was measured continuously at 210 nm during, at most 30 minutes.<p>

The uptake of nitrate is dependent on the pretreatment of the plants.
Plants grown on a N-less medium during the preteatment period showed a
higher uptake of nitrate than plants grown on a medium with KNO3 as
the sole N-source.  These results are in accordance with the
experiments of other authors and are generally explained in terms of a
high sugar content in the roots of the low-salt plants, which might
stimulate the uptake by stimulating respiration.  However, there
surely is no such simple relationship and other factors are certainly
involved (Pitman et al., 1971).  Wildtype plants pretreated on
ammonium sulphate as the sole N-source, followed by two days on a
N-less medium, showed a remarkably lower uptake of nitrate, compared
to plants grown on KNO3.<p>

Ammonium is known to inhibit nitrate reduction (e.g., Lycklama, 1963)
or the nitrate uptake (Minotti et al., 1969).  After two days on a
N-less medium, however, there is hardly any ammonium left in the
plants, so it is unlikely that in our experiments ammonium itself
could play an inhibiting role. Still, extracts of ammonium-grown
plants of Arabidopsis thaliana are capable of inhibiting NaR-activity,
from nitrate-grown plants (Oostindier-Braaksma, pers. comm.), so an
inhibition of NaR by a product stimulated by ammonium is a reasonable
assumption. An inhibition of the nitrate reduction can cause a
decrease in the uptake of nitrate (Lycklama, 1963).  However, B25, the
NaR-less mutant, is also strongly inhibited in its nitrate uptake by
ammonium, indicating that there is an effect of ammonium on the uptake
system as well. B25 shows a high uptake of nitrate when grown on
ammonium nitrate, followed by a N-less treatment for two days; even
higher than the wildtype plants under comparable circumstances. Since
B25 contains no NaR-activity, the uptake of nitrate during the
pretreatment causes the plant to fill up with nitrate, although at the
bginning of the pretreatment period there will be an inhibition by
ammonium of the uptake-process. This inhibition, however, is
counteracted by nitrate, so as the nitrate content of the plants
gradually increase, the inhbition decreases and the uptake will
increase to its maximal capacity.<p>

In wildtype plants, of course, there will be the same regulating
mechanism, but since there is a lower content of nitrate in these
plants, the balance between the ammonium inhibition and the counter
effect of nitrate will be more to the side of the ammonium. That means
the uptake in the wildtype plants will be lower than in the B25.<p>

The chl-l mutant shows a rather low uptake of nitrate compared to the
wildtype, after a pretreatment on ammonium nitrate, followed by a
N-less period of two days. This indicates a defect in connection with
the uptake system, since the NaR activity is not affected.  This goes
also for the uptake of chlorate.<p>

Another indication of the low uptake of nitrate in this mutant is its
phenotype on an ammonium nitrate medium. The mutant chl-l is much
smaller and darker green than the wildtype and the B25 on the same
medium, and it looks much the same as the wildtype on ammonium as the
sole N-source. This indicates a preferable uptake of ammonium over
nitrate in the chl-l, while in the wildtype this difference is less
obvious.<p>

To investigate possible changes in the action or affinity of the
proposed nitrate carrier of the mutants, different concentrations of
nitrate were offered to the plants and the resulting uptake rates were
determined as described above.  In the tested range from 0.01-10.0 meq
NO3/1, there appeared to be at least two phases in the uptake, both
phases exhibiting Michaelis-Menton kinetics as was indicated in a
previous paper (Doddema et al., 1975). The first, "high affinity",
phase had a Km of about 45 micro eq No3/1 in the wildtype as well as
in the mutants. The second, "low affinity", phase had a Km of about
13.5 meql, but the Km of the chl-l could not be calculated, since the
uptake rates of nitrate in this concentration area showed no
Michaelis-Menton kinetics, but gave a straight line, slightly
ascending from 1010 meq/l.  This could mean that the second phase is
missing altogether in this mutant, leaving in the area of phase two
only a passive diffusion. Further research is necessary, as the
possibility that some regulating factor is involved cannot be
excluded.<p>

More than one phase in the uptake of ions are quite common in higher
plants (Epstein, 1966; Laties, 1969, Nissen, 1974), but for nitrate
there was only little evidence so far.  Van Den Honert (1955) and
Lycklama (1963) observed just one phase in the range 0-1.0 meq/l in
maize and rye grass and the half value of uptake they computed was 21
micro eq/l (maize) and 33 micro eq/l (rye grass) respectively.  Koster
(1973), however, described two phases in the uptake of nitrate in
soy-beans and calculated a K 1m of 10 micro eq/l and a K 2m2 of 3
meq/l.  Rao and Rains (1976) observed a K 1m of 110 micro eq/l in
barley and an increase in the uptake rate above 0.5 meq/l, the
concentration where the Vmax for the first phase was reached.<p>

The origin of these two phases is still not clear.  Some authors claim
the "high affinity" phase represents the uptake by the cytoplasm
through the outer cell membrane (Toril and Laties, 1966), while the
"low affinity" phase should be the uptake through the tonoplast into
the vacuole.  Others think the multi-phase uptake is caused by an
abrupt change with the substrate concentration of the consitution of
that part of the cell membrane, involved in the uptake process
(Nissen, 1974), or even an influence of the diffusion barriers in the
free space of the cell walls (Goring and Ehwald, 1975).<p>

There is no conclusive evidence yet to prove any of the hypotheses
mentioned above, but if the slow uptake in chl-l is due to an
alteration in phase two of the uptake system, it is hard to imagine
that it should be a diffusion barrier which causes this effect.  A
change in the uptake system by the mutation, whereby this system has
become unable to transport nitrate in the high concentration area, as
proposed by Nissen, is quite acceptable. So is the possibility that,
in the model of Torii and Laties, the uptake through the plasmalemma
is unimpaired, while the active uptake through the tonoplast is
blocked. This latter model could also easily explain the fact that,
despite the slow nitrate uptake and the low nitrate content of the
plant, there is a very high NaR-activity in the chl-l mutant.  If all
the nitrate taken up is in the cytoplasm, because the way to the
vacuole is blocked, there would be a fast and high induction of NaR,
although the total nitrate content of the plant is low in other words,
NaR-activity in these circumstances has to be high to prevent the
cytoplasm from being poisoned by high levels of nitrate, since the
"safety valve", the transport to the vacuole, is blocked.<p>

As shown before, the uptake of chlorate is strongly reduced when
nitrate is present in the same medium (Doddema et al., 1975).  This
led us to investigate the kind of inhibition involved.  Kinetic
experiments were carried out in which several concentrations of
nitrate, in the range of phase 1, were taken up under the influence of
several concentrations of chlorate.  From the Lineweaver-Burk diagrams
we obtained, it was clear that chlorate inhibits the nitrate uptake
competitively in the range of 0.025-1.0 meq/1. That means that
chlorate can compete with nitrate on the same uptake site, and most
probably both anions are transported by the same carrier. Since the
reciprocal experiment has not been carried out yet, the possibility
remains that the chlorate ion can be transported by a specific
chlorate-carrier as well.<p>

In small concentrations, chlorate is able to stimulate nitrate uptake.
This, of course, obscures the inhibition kinetics considerably and
indicates a complex influence of chlorate on higher plants.<p>

Summarizing, it has been shown that the study of the uptake of nitrate
and chlorate in intact higher plants with the help of mutants can be
very promising.<p>

Nitrate and chlorate are most probably taken up by the same carrier,
but chlorate in low concentrations, has a stimulating effect on
nitrate uptake as well.<p>

The uptake of nitrate is inhibited by a substance present in
ammonium-grown plants, but this inhibition is counteracted by the
presence of nitrate.<p>

From the experiments with the uptake mutant the possibility emerges
that phase 1 and phase 2 are determined by different genes.  Only
phase 2 of the uptake system of nitrate appears to be affected by the
mutation chl-1, and there are some indications that this phase is
identical with the uptake through the tonoplast, in the model of Torii
and Laties.<p>

Research in these, as well as other, aspects of the uptake of nitrate
will be continued.<p>
