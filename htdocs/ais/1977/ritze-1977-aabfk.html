The aim of this preliminary study is the investigation of the
interactions of inhibitor substances and the phytochrome system
influencing the seed germination of Arabidopsis.<p>

Seed samples of the wildtype ch+ (selected from En2) and of the
chlorophyll b-defective mutant ch2, received from AIS-seed bank
Frankfurt/Main were used.  The seeds were harvested in 1972 and stored
at a temperature of -20*degrees*C. At first the seeds were sterilized
on paper soaked with aqueous solution of CaC102 (5,7 g/100 ml aqua
dest.)p after treatment of 30 minutes they were dried at 40*degrees*C.<p>

Then the seeds were sown in sterile petri dishes filled with filter
paper and 2 ml of sterilized water (control), or of the variable
concentrations of solutions (Table 1).<p>

In the experiments with the ch+, the seeds were treated with a
solution of gibberellic acid (GA3 10E-3M) instead of water. This was
necessary to have a comparable speed in germination in this genotype
(1).<p>

50 to 100 seeds were sown per petri dish under sterile conditions and
the petri dishes were sealed with parafilm. Afterwards the dishes were
exposed to the different light qualities (Table 2), then a
stratification (+4*degrees*C) followed for 10 to 24 hrs. After the
stratification they were kept at a constant temperature of
25*degrees*C. The germlings were counted under dim green safety-light;
as a sign for germination the appearance of the radicula was used.  In
all experiments the end of stratification was called t=O.<p>

Table 2: Light intensities applied in the experiments.<p>

For separating the native inhibitor substances, 200 mg of ch+ seeds
were shaken in 50 ml aqua bidest. for 2 hrs (25*degrees*C), then
concentrated up to 2 to 3 ml (Rotavapor, 50*degrees*C). This smaller
volume was analysed on this-layer-chromatography (F254, Merck) and
compared with abscisin (5 mg/ml).  Then a biotest was applied to prove
the water solubility of the separated native inhibitor; previously
washed seeds of ch+ and ch2 were sown for this on water-soaked or
inhibitor soaked paper. After the red light exposure, they were
treated as mentioned for the other experiments.<p>

1.  The normal germination is S-shaped: slow increase, fast climbing,
saturation as already observed by Kucera (1966).  The differences
between the two genotypes in the germination kinetics were equalized
by treating with GA3 (Figure 1).<p>

2.  In the first experiments, a lot of devaluations in germination
speed between the petri dishes were obtained.  McCullough and
Shropshire (1974) and Gettens-Hayes and Klein (1970) have found that
the light situation of the mother plant is "stored" in the phytochrome
system of the seed. For stopping this disturbing effect, the seeds
were standardized by 15 min far-red treatment.  Hereby, the maximum
devaluation decreases from 19 p.c. to nearly 4 p.c. between the petri
dishes. Gettens-Hayes and Klein found that the "information" about the
light quality could be stored (at room temperature) in the state of
phytochrome system till to 8 weeks.  However, now we may conclude from
our results, that phytochrome in Arabidopsis is able to store at a
temperature of -20*degrees*C the information over a period of at least
4 years, the age of the seeds used in our experiments. Thus, an
exposure of 15 minutes of far-red was used in the following
experiments.<p>

Figure 2: Germination speed in Arabidopsis thaliana treated with 5
minutes of red (r), white (w) blue (b), and far red (fr) is correlated
to the light quality.<p>

3.  The germination speed is correlated to the quality of the inducing
light for 5 minutes (Figure 2).  The fastest germination obtained was
by red light and by white light; the effect of blue and far-red was
lower.  In total there was no difference between ch+ and ch2.  5
minutes red is sufficient for getting Pfr values which mediate
germination kinetics.  No specific effects were obtained by white,
because of its spectral data, but the blue-light was very effective.
Some authors (Briggs, 1974) discuss a second light depending control
system besides the phytochrome, which absorbs in the blue region of
the spectrum, which is probably the main system in fundi.  Hartmann
(1967) has explained this blue light effect by the high energy
reaction of the phytochrome, but he used long lasting light exposures
in his experiments.  Our own results presented above, since depending
on short time exposures and cerain light treatments, offer also some
speculations about a blue light sensitive system.  Anyway, we need
more experiments on this subject, because the phytochrome also absorbs
remarkably in the blue part of the spectrum.<p>

4.  There was no effect of the inhibitor substances on the germination
at all, except for cycloheximide, which was toxic at the
concentrations used, since the seeds were killed.  The other
inhibitors had no significant effect on the germination, however, the
further deelopment of the seedlings was influenced (Kranz, 1977).<p>

5.  The germination once started could be stopped till to a definite
time by far-red.  The interval between the end of the stratification
and the far-red exposure should not exceed 23 hours for ch+ or 16
hours for ch2.  No effect of the inhibitors was observed.  Since there
is no principal difference between the effect of the phytochrome in
ch+ and ch2 affecting the germination, we suggest a higher speed
concerning the biochemical reactions which are necessary for
germination (Figure 3); this would mean, that the regulator system
which follows the phytochrome is limiting, or the ch2 can realize some
further steps in the dark or far red, which are blocked in the ch+.<p>

6.  Although it is possible to isolate a native inhibitor from the
ch+-seeds, nevertheless, the germination decreases in this genotype
(Figure 4). This means that an inhibitor and an unknown promoter was
washed out of the ch+-seeds.<p>

There is no difference in the germination of ch2-seeds.  Washed seed
samples treated with the extract of the other genotype show quite
different results: ch+-germination is just like the control, but the
ch2-germination decreases.<p>

Figure 4: Germination in p.c. of the untreated, washed and treated
seeds. Hatched columns: ch+.<p>

The inhibitor of the ch+ decreases the germination of the ch2
slightly. This will lead us to a scheme of a promoter inhibitor system
referring to seed germination in Arabidopsis.  We now have to look for
their nature.<p>
