The spirally-twisted growth of roots seems to be a general phenomenon.
MacDonald and Gordon (1978) observed that on horizontal white filter
paper, cress roots grew straight in dark but were twisted, distorted
and corkscrew-like in light. Because cress roots were phototropically
nonresponsive to light, it was suggested that light enhanced the
gravisensitivity of horizontal cress roots resulting in the distorted
growth. In a recent study (Mirza, 1987), the use of an agravitropic
but phototropicaly responsive mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana made it
possible to distinguish the effects of light and gravity on the
direction of horizontal root growth. It was shown that both unilateral
light and gravity induce horizontal clockwise curvatures in roots
(perpendicular to the direction of light and gravity), and that light
and gravity interact to determine the direction and magnitude of
horizontal curvature.<p>

Arabidopsis roots also exhibit serpentine, spirally-twisted growth.
The aim of the present study has been to investigate the extent to
which gravity can induce spirally-twisted growth in roots.<p>

Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana, ecotype Landsberg (erecta mutant) were
sown on the surface of 1 percent (w/v) agar in 9 cm Petri dishes. The
dishes were first stored at 4*degrees*C for 2 days and then incubated
(25+/-1*degree*C) for the first 3 days in the vertical position and
for the next 3 days at various angles (0*degrees, 30*degrees*,
45*degrees*, 60*degrees*, 90*degrees*) to the vertical so that 90
*degrees* to the vertical was the horizontal position. During
incubation, seedlings were illuminated by white fluorescent tubes
(above and below the dishes) with photon flux density of 150 micro E
m-2 s-1 at the level of the dishes. After incubation, the dishes were
directly exposed to photographic paper.<p>

Figure 1: Seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana grown on the surface of
agar in light. The agar dishes were held in the vertical position for
the first 3 days, and for the next 3 days were clamped at various
angles to the vertical: (a) 0*degrees*, (b) 30*degrees*, (c)
60*degrees*c, (d) 90*degrees*. (e) magnified portion of a root from d.<p>

In light, Arabidopsis roots grew straight on vertical (0*degrees) agar
dishes, but as the angle of stimulation was increased (0*degrees -
90*degrees*) the spirally-twisted growth of roots increased
accordingly (Figure 1a-e). During spirally twisted growth, the root
tip was curved down (beak-like) and the root alternatively rotated
along its axis (apparent by the oblique arrangement epidermal cells)
so that each twist raised the lower side. On horizontal agar, however,
some roots developed clockwise curvatures (horizontal coiling) along
with spirally twisted growth. The clockwise coiled roots either lacked
"beaks" or had very weakly developed "beaks". On the other hand,
Arabidopsis roots did not exhibit spirally twisted growth at any
stimulation angle when incubated in darkness.<p>

The serpentine, spirally-twisted growth of Arabidopsis roots was only
apparent after exposure to light. MacDonald (1976) and MacDonald and
Gordon (1978) suggested that light enhanced the gravisensitivity of
horizontal cress roots and this resulted in the twisted growth. This
seems to be true in Arabidopsis roots also. Present results, however,
further demonstrate that the intensity spirally twisted growth is
apparently related to the angle of gravitational stimulus.<p>

The formation of a stronger "beak" in a horizontally growing root
would decrease the angle of root tip with respect to the gravity
vector and this would produce spirally twisted growth like that of
60*degrees*, 45*degrees*, or 30*degrees* stimulated roots. In
contrast, roots with weakly developed "beaks" will be at higher
stimulation angles and would therefore give more consistent responses
by developing horizontal clockwise coiling.<p>

In conclusion, it appears that the intensity of spirally twisted
growth of roots is directly related to the angle of gravitational
stimulus. In light, Arabidopsis roots grow straight on vertical agar
dishes, but increasing angle of gravitational stimulus gives
increasing spirally twisted growth of roots.<p>
