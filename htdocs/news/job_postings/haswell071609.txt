A postdoctoral position is open in the Haswell Lab in the Biology Department at Washington 
University in St. Louis (see http://biology4.wustl.edu/faculty/haswell/ for a research description). 
Several projects are available; each uses a combination of genetic, cell biological, biochemical, 
and/or electrophysiological techniques to study the structure and function of a family of 
mechanosensitive ion channels in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. 
 
Applicants with previous plant biology or electrophysiology experience are preferred. 
 
To apply, please submit to ehaswell@wustl.edu: 
 
1.  A cover letter explaining specifically why you are interested in joining the group, what skills 
and knowledge you would contribute, and what you think we could offer in terms of training.  In 
addition, please describe your career goals. 
 
2.  A CV with three or more references and their full contact information. 
 
3.  A short proposal for a possible project in the lab.  This need not be detailed, but should 
indicate that you have read enough of the literature to be sincerely interested in some aspect of 
our research, and that you can think independently and creatively about your work.  This can be 
part of the cover letter.
