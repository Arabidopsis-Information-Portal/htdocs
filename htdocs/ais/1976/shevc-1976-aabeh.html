Abstract<p>

A determination of the number of initial cells for generative tissues
during Arabidopsis thaliana ontogeny was the subject of this study.<p>

Earlier we have found (SHEVCHENKO, GRINIKH, GRIGORIEVA, 1975) that the
average number of initial cells for main inflorescence in 9 day old A.
thaliana plants was 5.  In this paper we determined the number of
initial cells at later stages of development, i.e., during the period
of rosette formation.<p>

A. thaliana plants (race En) grown in glasses on minimal agar medium
were irradiated by 5, 7, and 9 kr gamma rays in 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,
and 15 days after sowing. The plants were divided into four groups
according to the phases of development: 9 day old plants had 2 rosette
leaves, 10-11 day old plants had 4 leaves, 12-13 day old plants had
extremely small fifth leaf, 14-15 day old plants had 5 leaves. The
plants were transplanted into soil immediately after irradition and
grown under conditions as follows: continuous illumination and
23-40*degrees*C.  In 15-25 pods of the main inflorescence chlorophyll
deficient mutants were scored irrespectively from their embryo size
(MULLER's embryo test).<p>

The data obtained were summarized because there was no essential
difference in the frequency of mutant pods on the mutant plants at
various doses of radiation.  Sterile and multicaulis plants were
removed and the rate of mutant plants was calculated among the
remains.<p>

Table 1: Correlation between normal and mutant pods in main
inflorescences of mutant A. thaliana plants irradiated by gamma rays
at different stages of the rosette formation.<p>

As can be seen from Table 1, the frequency of mutant pods in 9-11 day
old plants was not more than 20 percent and about 25 percent in 12-15
day old plants. From these values the average number of initial cells
was calculated to be 5, 4 in 9-10 day old plants and 3,8 in 12-15 day
old plants.  From these values the average number of initial cells was
calculated to be 5, 4 in 9-10 day old plants and 3,8 in 2-15 day old
plants. From the data obtained we can conclude that there was a
decrease of the number of initial cells to the end of the period of
the rosette formation (P.O.98).<p>
