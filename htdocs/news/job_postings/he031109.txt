Postdoctoral fellow at National University of Singapore and Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory  
 
 
 
A postdoctoral fellow is sought to study molecular and epi-genetic mechanisms underlying the 
floral transition in Arabidopsis, in the lab of Dr. Yuehui He at the National University of Singapore 
and the Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory, Singapore. The successful candidate will investigate 
how the expression of regulatory genes controlling the timing of floral transition is regulated by 
chromatin modifications and DNA methylation in plants using biochemical and molecular tools. 
We are looking for a highly motivated individual with biochemical and molecular genetic training. 
The postdoctoral candidate should have first-authored publications in internationally-referred 
journals. Singapore is known as 'Garden City', and the city country has gained recognition for its 
dynamic life-science research environment.  
 
 
 
Please submit a resume together with the names of three referees to Dr. Yuehui He by email 
(dbshy@nus.edu.sg).
