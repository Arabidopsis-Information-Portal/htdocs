Post-doc position in Plant Molecular Biology: Thylakoid biogenesis/vesicle transport

Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences
Göteborg University, Sweden (<http://www.gu.se/>www.gu.se)

We seek a highly motivated person who is interested in attending a post-doc period in Plant 
Molecular Biology. The topic deals with vesicular transport inside the chloroplast using the plant 
model Arabidopsis thaliana. The position is funded for 12 months by Carl Tryggers Foundation and can 
be prolonged if successful. The grant is 18000 SEK/month (~1950 EUROS/month).

Project description
The aim of the project is to understand how the thylakoid membrane is initially formed and maintained. 
We aim to test the hypothesis of a chloroplast localized vesicular transport system, similar to the 
membrane transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. A recent study, using 
the Arabidopsis genome and web-based localization prediction tools, identified putative chloroplast-
localized proteins with a high sequence similarity to components of cytosolic vesicular trafficking 
(Andersson & Sandelius 2004, BMC). The lack of “hard” biochemical data for the localization and 
function of the identified proteins makes it a very attractive hypothesis. We aim to obtain real 
biochemical data to test this hypothesis. The first goal is to establish the predicted chloroplast-
localization of the putative chloroplast vesicular trafficking components. The second goal is to 
determine functions for each different protein. The third goal is to identify the molecular events 
that drive chloroplast-localized vesicular transport.

Requirements
An ideal applicant should posses a PhD degree in plant molecular biology or a related field necessary 
to accomplish the mission given. Computer skills are necessary and general genetics and molecular 
biology laboratory skills are required. Experience from work with vesicles is a plus.

Application
Please submit your CV, a letter describing your research interest and skills, list of publications, 
and contact information for two references by email to Dr Henrik Aronsson 
(<mailto:henrik.aronsson@botany.gu.se>henrik.aronsson@botany.gu.se). Please include when you 
will be able to start the position. Application deadline is 28th of February.

For further information please phone/email Dr Henrik Aronsson, the principal investigator of 
this project. Looking forward to hear from you! (Phone: +46 (0)31 7734802)
