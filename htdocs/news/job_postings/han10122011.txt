A Postdoctoral Research Associate position is available in the laboratory of
Kyung-Hwan Han in the Department of Horticulture at Michigan State
University (MSU). The research in our lab focuses on (1) understanding of
the molecular mechanisms of secondary growth / secondary wall biosynthesis
(Ko et al. 2004, Plant Physiology 135: 1069-1083; Ko et al., 2007, Plant J
50: 1035-1048; Ko et al., 2009, Plant J 60: 649-665) and (2) development of
drought-tolerant crops through our patented XERICO technology (US patent no.
7,977,535; Ko et al., 2006, Plant J 169: 469-478). We are seeking a highly
motivated post-doctoral research associate to work on either of the two
research focus areas (secondary wall biosynthesis or drought tolerance).
Successful candidate should have an extensive experience in plant molecular
biology and biotechnology techniques. The Han Laboratory is well equipped to
carry out the research. In addition, MSU offers a highly stimulating
research atmosphere with a vibrant plant science community and provides
state-of-the-art, well-run core facilities in genomic, proteomic, protein
analytical, bioinformatics and imaging technologies.

Please send letter of interest, CV and names of three references to
Kyung-Hwan Han at hanky@msu.edu.
