The nature of the geographical distribution of natural populations of
Arabidopsis thaliana as to their developmental characteristics was
proved to be adaptive and genoclinal in a height and temperature
gradient of Moravia, the winter-annual genotypes were prevailing in
the lowland while the summer-annual ones in the highland (CETL,
DOBROVOLNA, and EFFMERTOVA, 1969; CETL, 1977).  This evidence has been
gathered by individual unrepeated samples in particular spatially
well-isolated localities since 1963.<p>

Occasionally repeated samples at the same localities showed that the
percentage of summer-annual plants (g) and the mean number of days to
the appearance of the flower primordia in the summer-annual plant
fraction (x) remained without any change in one part of the material
while more or less distinct changes could be observed in the other.
As a rule, unchanged developmental characteristics occurred in the
lowland localities with no or slight anthropic influences. This fact
may be connected with the equilibrium conditions of the populations
from these localities (CETL and PLCHOVA, 1975, CETL, 1976).<p>

Three examples can be given.  (1) In the populations sample from a
steppe locality near Pohorelice (200 meters a.s.l.) g was 11. percent
in 1969 and 9.7 percent in 1975 (chi sq.(1) = 0.30, P = 0.5 to 0.7).
(2) In the population sample from a steppe locality near Pouzdrany
(260 meter a.s.l.) g was 46.1 per cent in 1968 and 49.1 per cent in
1972 (chi sq. = 0.41, P = 0.5 to 0.7), mean value of x was 31.5 days
in 1968 and 29.1 days in 1972 (t(180)= 2.14, P 0.05).  (3) In the
population sample from a grassy locality near Kninicky (230 meters
a.s.l.) g was 62.4 per cent in 1964 and 78. per cent in 1972 (chi
sq.(1) = 11.90, P 0.001), mean value of x was 23.6 days in 1964 and
15.3 days in 1972 (t(169) = 12.58, P 0.01)<p>

While in the examples (1) and (2) no visible changes took place in the
localities and no or little shift of developmental characteristics
occurred in the time period between the two samplings, in the example
(3) the original locality was destroyed by the vast groundframe, and a
very numerous population of A. thaliana appeared on the upset soil
surface.  It results from the nature of selection pressures in our
lowland localities that all anthropic influences connected with
destruction of the present soil surface must lead to a certain
preference of summer-annual genotypes.<p>

For this reason a whole series of spatially more or less isolated
small groups was studied in 1975 in the locality given in the examplle
(1). In the direction of gradually increasing intensity of anthropic
influences from an entirely intact natural sublocality to that with
the most destroying pressures, the following g s were found: O.; 4.;
19.; 15.9; 25.4.<p>

It can be summarized that temporal and local changes of genotypoic
frequencies are also of adaptive nature and can give some information
about the changes in the environment, especially about those which are
connected with various human activities.<p>
