Although Arabidopsis thaliana is an autogamous plant, the Fragilis
trisomic does not set seeds without artificial pollination.  This
trisomic has two flower anomalies, either or both of which may be
responsible for the failure of pollination: (1) Hetrostyly, the stigma
protruding beyond the anthers.  (2) Protogyny, the female gametophyte
maturing a few days earlier than the male.<p>
