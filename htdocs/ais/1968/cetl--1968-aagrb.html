<h2>Further data on the developmental characters of natural populations of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) HEYNH. from Western Moravia</h2><p>

I. CETL and JIRINA DOBROVOLNA<p>

(Department of Genetics, Purkyne University, Brno, Czechoslovakia)<p>

The experiments with natural populations reported by CETL, DOBROVOLNA,
and EFFMERTOVA (1965), 1967), CETL (1965) and EFFMERTOVA and CETL
(1966) were continued in 1965 and 1966/67 under the same experimental
conditions as in the previous experiments (soil culture of plants from
unvernalized post-dormancy seeds at 25+3*degrees*C under continuous
illumination, 1250 lux; duration of each experiment 42 days from full
germination).<p>

The results for the three periods expressed by the distributions (1)
of the percentage of generative plants, (2) of the mean number of days
to appearance of the flower primordia in the generative plant
fraction, and (3) of its standard deviation, are presented in the
Tables 1, 2, and 3.  The characteristics (2) and (3) are not given in
populations with <20 percent gnerative plants.  &#160;These data confirm
that both among and within the studied populations a considerable
variability in developmental characters is present.<p>

The percentage of generative plants in single populations is quite
different changing from 0 to 100.  When using the earlier
classification of populations (see CETL, 1965) about 20 percent of all
the 164 populations appear to be "winter annual", about 15 percent
"mixed" and about 65 percent "summer annual";<p>

Table 1:  Percent of generative plants<p>

Among the populations there are also differences in the mean number of
days to appearance of flower primordia in the fraction of the
generative plants, the extreme values being 9, 1 and 36, 1 days:<p>

Table 2: Mean number of days to appearance of flower primordia in the
generative plant fraction<p>

The standard deviations of the foregoing values indicating the
variability within populations are also very different (minimum +/-0,
42, maximum +/- 12, 85 days).  Only in two "summer annual" populations
the s values are as low as in homozygous races (cf. DOBROVOLNA, 1967).
Therefore, only these two populations can be regarded as homozygous
for the studied character while the remaining 132 populations appear
to be heterozygous:<p>

Table 3: Standard deviation for the number of days to appearance of
the flower primordia in the generative plant fraction<p>

The results show that the new experimental material confirms the
conception suggested on the basis of the first experiments (CETL,
1965), that natural populations of Arabidopsis with respect to their
developmental characters are genetically variable and internally
complex entities.<p>
