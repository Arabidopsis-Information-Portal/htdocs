It was shown earlier by LANGRIDGE (1955), REDEI (1960) and JACOBS
(1965) that Arabidopsis thaliana is a suitable organism for the
biochemical genetics of higher plants.  In particular chlorophyll
mutants which revert phenotypically on supplemented media are a proper
tool for such investigations.  In our experiments 35 chlorophyll
mutants were screened for reversions on nutrient media supplemented
with single amino acids.  Only one mutant - virigoalbina 40/3 -
reverted phenotypically to the wild type on a medium with leucine.
Previously it was reported that this mutant is allelic to the mutation
"Weiss ausbleichand", V-155/2 (KASYANENKO, 1969).  Indeed, both
alleles responded similarly to the addition of leucine, though the
reaction was more clearly expressed in the viridoalbina 40/3.  The
addition to the nutrient medium of 200 mg/per liter DL-leucine
increased the contents of the photosynthetic pigments and especially
carotene; it restored the morphology and ultrastructure of
chloroplasts and noticeably rose the intensity of photosynthesis. The
leaves of the plants, grown on the leucine were more resistant to high
intensity of light.  Leucine also increased the rate of development
and the dry weight of the plants.<p>
