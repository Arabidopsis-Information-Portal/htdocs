A mass selection study is being carried out on 14-day fresh-weight in
several artificially constructed populations.  The plants are grown in
a controlled environment under aseptic conditions (LANGRIDGE, 1957),
and after being weighed they are stored prior to selection of the best
plants. The storage trays are commercially-made holders for "Dispo"
assay trays, each with a sheet of "Plexiglass" laid across the top.  A
number of 8 mm holes are bored in each cover so that one tray
corresponds to one of the wooden blocks used to hold test tubes.  In
use, the trays are filled with water and plants are placed one to a
hole, in which position they will remain viable for 24 hours or more.
If it is known that some plants will not be included in the selected
group, circles are drawn around the holes corresponding to those
plants. The time saved may be important, since one person can weigh
and store only about 80 plants per hour.  The plants are potted,
initially on agar blocks, by a technique similar to that of Van Der
VEEN (1966) giving an ultimate survival rate of close to 100 percent.
An overall generation time of 3 months has been maintained in the
study involving cross-fertilization of selected plants.<p>
