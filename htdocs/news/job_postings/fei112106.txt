A bioinformatics postdoctoral position is available immediately to work on a
tomato functional genomics project which focuses on improving fruit nutrition
and flavor quality using an integrated functional genomics and bioinformatics
approach. The major responsibilities for this position include implementation
of computational tools and resources to integrate gene expression and
metabolite profile data; analysis of large scale sequence, gene and protein
expression, and metabolite profile data; inference and modeling of
transcriptional and metabolic networks.

Requirements: The successful candidate will have a recent Ph.D or equivalent in
Bioinformatics, Molecular Biology, Computer Science or closely related fields;
demonstrated professional experiences in bioinformatics algorithm/tool
development and large scale data mining and analysis. Additional experience in
web-based bioinformatics database development is preferred but not essential.

To Apply: Please send a cover letter stating research interests, a CV, and the
contact information of 3 references to Dr. Zhangjun Fei, Boyce Thompson
Institute for Plant Research, Tower Road, Ithaca, NY 14853.
Email:zf25@cornell.edu. Salary will be commensurate with experience.
