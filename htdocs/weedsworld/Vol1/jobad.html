A graduate research assistantship [assitant(e) diplome(e)] is available 
to work toward a PhD degree at the University of Lausanne. The research 
project is aimed at the characterization of two ion transporters in the 
plant Arabidopsis thaliana. A number of cell and molecular biology 
techniques will be used to study the function of these transporters in 
plant cells. These techniques include immunocytochemical localization of 
the proteins within cells, determination of the pattern of expression in 
plant tissues by in situ mRNA hybridization, functional expression of 
the proteins in yeast and Xenopus oocytes, and antisense down-regulation 
of gene expression in transgenic plants. <P>

This position includes some teaching responsibilities. It is available 
for up to 5 years, starting February 1995. The salary for the first year 
is CHF 44 000 (social charges included). Ability to speak French or 
desire to learn it in the first year is required. Interested persons 
should send their curriculum vitae, university transcripts, and names of 
two references to Dr. Yves Poirier at the following addresses: <P>
