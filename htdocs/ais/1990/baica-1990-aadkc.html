ABSTRACT<p>

Dry seeds, containing embryos of the crucifer plant Arabidopsis
thaliana (L.), Heynh. were flown in the orbit for 14 days on BIOKOMOS
9 satellite. The seeds were fixed on glass supports with K2 nuclear
emulsion or AgCl-detectors using ESA-BIORACK-units Type I and II. One
unit of Type I was exposed outside, the other ones (Type I and II)
were installed inside and outside the satellite. The temperature
profiles of the flown seeds inside and outside the satellite were
simulated on earth with an identical Backup control sample. Additional
controls were studied using the original seed sample. By use of the
nuclear track emulsions and AgCl-detectors, tracks of heavy ions
(HZE-particles) were measured with a PC-assisted microscope.
Preliminary dosimetric data are presented for inside and outside
exposed detectors and seeds. The biological damages were investigated
by growing the seeds under controlled climatic conditions.  Among the
biological endpoints of the cosmic radiation damage studied in M1
generation. Seed germination (i.e. lethality of embryos) and flowering
(i.e.  growth delay) of outside exposed objects, the tetraploid
genotype became more damaged than the inside, diploid ones. This
result is based on the total dose effect but not on the single hit of
cosmic heavy ions which will be presented in later publications.<p>

INTRODUCTION<p>

The joint ESA (Paris)/IBMP (Moscow) life science experiments of the
BIOKOSMOS serie with plant seeds is aimed at the radiation effect of
cosmic ionizing particle radiation in embryonic meristem cells of
resting seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh.. The particles,
entering the BIORACK-units and penetrating the seed coat plus
embryonic epiderm may cause radiation damage in the stem cell
initials, the so-called genetic effective cells (GEC) of the shoot.<p>

The system used in the BIOKOSMOS 9 (Cosmos-2044) experiment differed
from that of the BIOKOS-MOS 8 flight (ZIMMERMANN et al., 1988, KRANZ
et al., 1989) with respect to the detector hard ware as well as to the
genotype of the biological subjects. The experiment is aimed at
differentiating the effects of the Cosmic Radiation (CR) for its
various components and their quality factors as well as to distinguish
the biological damage for the smaller target of diploid and the larger
one of tetraploid cell nuclei.<p>

Physical and biological arguments:<p>

The spectral composition of the Cosmic Radiation in the nearpole orbit
of the BIO-KOSMOS 9 mission (T=82.7*degrees*) is characteristically
different from that of the SL 1-mission (T=57*degrees*) for example,
and from the planned ERA-mission (T=27*degrees*), as a consequence of
the geomagnetic cutoff. In nearpole orbits particles of lower rigidity
are admitted, i.e. particles of lower energy and heavy ions of higher
charge and LET (HZE-ions). In contrast to this situation, on orbits of
low inclination these particles are bent away and only high energetic
particles of high rigidity are admitted from the outer space,
predominantly fast protons, producing nuclear disintegrations (stars
and their fragments) within the surrounding material; HZE-particles of
LET > 2 GeV/cm H2O will be missing (HEINRICH et al., 1989).  Among the
fragments from stars ending protons (and a-particels) may play a
sig-nificant role with respect to the increasing quality factor at
LET-values of 400 MeV/cm H2O towards the end of their range (PRETRE,
1971; FOLKHARD et al., 1989).<p>

Table 1 presents an estimate of expected fluxes of the various
components of the CR and the energy transfer onto the Arabidopsis
seeds during the BIOKOSMOS 9-mission. Row 8 shows an estimate of the
probability of single strand breaks (SSB) per seed (CHRISTENSEN et
al., 1972) caused by p- and a-enders; on the BIOKOSMOS orbit it is by
a factor of 10 lower than that expected from HZE-particles (LET > 1
GeV/cm), whereas it comes into the same order of magnitude in the
ERA-mission (T=27*degrees*).5<p>

There is still a biological argument: In the BIOKOSMOS 8 experiment
mutagenic effects have been observed at Arabidopsis seeds which had
not been hit by a HZE-particle (KRANZ et al., 1989). It seems
therefore useful to take into consideration also effects caused by
other components of the CR, in particular that of the low energy
proton component including secondary protons from albedo neutrons and
their enders (SCHOPPER et al., 1967).<p>

We therefore decided for detectors showing a broad range and low
threshold of sensitivity (LET _ 20 MeV/cm H2O) which record particles
below the LET of HZE-particles: AgCl-detectors and K2-nuclear emulsion
on glass-support, record-ing protons up to _ 40 MeV. They also allow
us - at least in some characteristic cases - to localize vertices of
stars originating inside the seed, from their outgoing prongs. The
biological contribution of these stars should not be neglected.<p>

The hardware construction: BIORACK Type I (ESA): A low-shielding unit
was mounted at the outside of the satellite (OFI) protected during the
flight by 1.3 g/cm2 stainless steel; for comparison an identic unit
was flown inside the satellite (IFI) behind about 15g/cm2 Al.<p>

Figure 1 shows the detectors, consisting of 200 micron thick
K2-emulsion on glass plates (ILFORD Ltd.) fixed at glass frames (A)
and kept in small, well defined distance by the glass-frame (B) from
the biological layer; the latter consisted of seeds fixed with
Luviskol upon a 170 micron thick glass-plate which was mounted at
frame (C). This structure allowed to keep the emulsion in a closed
small gas volume at 60% constant humidity (and thickness) separated by
the thin glass plate from the "biology" which was kept itself in a
closed volume of dry argon gas.<p>

The frames ABC, glued to each other during the flight as a
compartment, could be separated after the flight. Reference marks of
about 10 micron width, evaporated onto the thin glass plate support of
the "biology", and projected by light onto the emulsion surface, allow<p>

1) to localize and to assign biological objects and particle tracks
correlated by the reference marks on the glass and on the emulsion,<p>

2) to handle the "biology" and the detectors in separate procedures,
and finally<p>

3) to evaluate them with our videoelectronic and computer-controlled
microscope systems (BAUMGARDT et al., 1986a, 1986b; SCHOPPER et al.,
1986).<p>

The nuclear emulsions have been developed in Strasbourg (CNR) after a
test development at the IBMP, Moscow. Two of the five emulsion sheets
of the units OFI and three of IFI are evaluated at Moscow.<p>

BIORACK Type II-unit (ESA): This unit of higher shielding (protected
by _ 15g/cm2 Al) was flown only inside the satellite and supplied with
AgCl-detectors (Figure 2).<p>

A matrix of LED's, fed by 4 Li-batteries 6 provided the yellow light
necessary for the stabilization of the tracks in the AgCl-detectors
during the flight (SCHOPPER et al., 1986). The monocrystalline, 150
micron thick layers of AgCl (Cd) on glass-supports sealed with a 2
micron thick coating (Epoxite), were bearing the Arabidopsis seeds in
direct contact. The detectors were mounted on glass plates which were
kept in distance by glass frames, thus forming gas-tight compartments
filled with dry argon.<p>

and nuclear emulsion; the data are stored off line for the later
assignment to the biological objects.<p>

b) densitrometric data and LET-values of these particles.<p>

Fading effects at the latent tracks in both types of detectors, caused
by the time-delay between flight and development as well as by
increased temperatures during the landing phase (> 60*degrees*C at the
outside units) are corrected by inflight calibration at the prongs of
nuclear stars. Table 2 shows some global dosimetric data.<p>

Biological Data<p>

The dry seeds, containing embryos of the crucifer plant Arabidopsis
thaliana (L.) Heynh. were flown in the orbit for 352 hrs. on BIOKOSMOS
9 satellite. The seeds were fixed on glass supports with K2 nuclear
emulsion or AgCl-detectors using BIORACK-units type I and II as
already described. One unit (OFI) was exposed outside, the other ones
were installed inside the satellite. The temperature profiles of the
flown seeds inside and outside the satellite were simulated on earth
with an identical Backup control sample (IBI, OBI). Additional
controls were: lab control CI and SC, using the original seed sample,
the latter non-fixed on the detector sheets. By use of nuclear track
emulsions and AgCl-detectors, tracks of heavy ions (HZE-particles)
will be measured with a PC-assisted microscope and the datas of impact
parameters correlated to bio-objects (seed embryos) in later single
hit analysis.<p>

The biological damages were investigated by in vitro growing seeds on
aseptic medium under controlled climatic conditions (KRANZ et al.,
1989). By a first quick look estimation of the total dose effect (TDE)
without single track and hit analysis we studied the seed germination
and the flowering process of grown seedlings (Figures 3 and 4). The
biological damage endpoints increase both with total cosmic radiation
dose from inside (0.2 rad) to outside (1.2 rad) exposed seeds and from
the smaller cross section of the diploid target nucleus of the genetic
effective meristem cells to the larger one of the tetraploid cells
which was evidently caused by less shielding cosmic radiation mostly
of the low LET particles (cf. Table 2).<p>

Figure 4. Effect of flight conditions on the temporal development of
first open flower.<p>

Lethality of seedlings obtained at the end of the germination process
shows clearly the higher sensitivity of the seeds exposed in space
(OFI) in comparison to the control samples SC CI, OBI (cf. Figure 3).
An additional result obtained is shown by the different growth dynamic
observed for the seed germination and for the flowering of seedlings.
Both processes are delayed depending also on the shielding position
inside vs. outside. The larger target size of the tetraploid cell
nuclei results in maximum delay mainly of flowering (Figure 4).<p>

The physiological background of such growth delays induced by cosmic
ionizing radiation is an interesting aspect. We assume that the
hormonal control by auxin and/or gibberellic acid (GA) is concerned.
Earlier findings of REINHOLZ (1967) have already shown that GA (.002
to .2 p.c.) reduced the inhibiting effect of x-irradiation on seed
germination in the range of 100 to 800 kR. The beneficial effect of GA
(.1 p.c.) and cysteine (.1 p.c.) on _-irradiation seeds (36 to 78 kR)
had been observed additionally by KUCERA (1966). We will make use of
this earlier result in the proposed BIO-KOS-MOS 10 experiment with
Arabidopsis, presently, prepared for the next KOSMOS-flight mission in
1991. Investigations of this type may contribute to the general
problem of radioprotective substances applied to biological subjects
exposed to the space environment and, thus, the basical question of
stress and risk of space missions (KRANZ, 1990).<p>
