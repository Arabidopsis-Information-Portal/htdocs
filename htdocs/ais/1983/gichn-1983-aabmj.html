Maleic hydrazide (MH) and its potassium (K-MH) and diethanolamine
(DEA-MH) salts are one of the most used regulators of plant growth. In
bacteria, fungi and animal systems, MH was either ineffective or
exhibited a low clastogenic and mutagenic activity. By contrast, MH
has a strong clastogenic activity on plant chromosomes (Swietlinska
and Zuk, 1978) and together with both its salts revealed a high
activity in the Tradescantia- (Gichner et al., 1982b) and in the
Nicotiana tabacum-mutagenicity assays (Briza et al., 1984). In the
Tradescantia assay, the mutagenic activity was expressed by the number
of somatic mutations in stamen hairs of a heterozygous clone 4430. The
application of MH and its salts to the inflorescences for 24 h induced
up to 20-25 mutation events per 100 stamen hairs scored. The frequency
of somatic mutation following treatment by a strong alkylating agent
N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) was approximately on the same level
whereas the control value was less than 0.3.<p>

In the Nicotiana assay, the mutagenic activity was expressed by the
number and size of somatic reversions on leaves of a double
heterozygous mutant of Nicotiana tabacum var. xanthi n.c.. The
so-called reversion rate after treatments by MH and its salts reached
the values of 57 to 255 x 10 5, compared to the value 165 x 10 5 after
MNU treatments and of about 1.5 x 10 5 of the control (Gichner et al.,
unpubl.)<p>

In 1965, Muller reported that exposure of Arabidopsis seeds to 25 mM
MH for 18 h did not evoke a significant increase in the frequency of
embryonic and chlorophyll mutations. We have repeated the experiments,
using concentrations of MH up to 80 mM (dissolved in dimethyl
sulphoxide) and the same concentrations of K-MH and DEA-MH (dissolved
in water) and treated nonpresoaked seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana, race
Dijon for 24 h at 25*degrees*C. Although these treatments induced
severe somatic damage, expressed by the inhibition of M 1 root growth
(Muller, 1964b), the frequency of embryonic and chlorophyll mutations
and the degree of sterility (Muller, 1963, 1964a) was not above the
spontaneous level (Figure 1A).<p>

In further attempts to find out the possible mutagenic potential of MH
in Arabidopsis, we have exposed Arabidopsis seeds and seedlings to
chronic treatment. Arabidopsis seeds were sown on Petri dishes (70 mm)
containing 20 ml of 0.7% agar with various concentrations of MH. After
3 weeks of cultivation at 25*degrees*C with a 14 h day, the M 1
germination, M 1 root length and M 1 survival was measured. The M 1
survival was expressed by the percentage of seedlings that reached the
4th-5th true leaf stage. The survived seedlings were transferred to a
greenhouse and cultivated in soil. As demonstrated in Figure 1B,
chronic exposure of seeds and seedlings of MH markedly decreased the
length of M 1 roots and the M 1 survival, but had no effect on the
frequency of embryonic and chlorophyll mutants as well as on the
degree of sterility. Together with the futile attempts to induce
mutations with acute exposures to Arabidopsis seeds, the results
suggest that MH and its salts are not mutagenic in this plant species.<p>

The activity of MH and its salts in the Tradescantia- and
Nicotiana-mutagenicity assays and the absence of mutagenicity of these
compounds in Arabidopsis clearly demonstrates the differential
response of plant species to various mutagens. Although Arabidopsis is
regarded as a plant species with a high sensitivity towards mutagens
and/or carcinogens (Redei et al., 1980) the Arabidopsis mutagenicity
assay cannot be recommended as a sole one representative for the plant
kingdom.<p>
