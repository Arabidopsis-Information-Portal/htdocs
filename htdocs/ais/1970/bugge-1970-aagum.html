<h2> Some observations on McKELVIEs axillaris mutant</h2><p>

Already in 1962 McKELVIE described a mutant which he named axillaris
(ax) "with two flowers growing from the base of each 'pod'".  There is
almost no doubt that this mutant is at least phenotypically identical
with the spontaneous variant mentioned above by USMANOV.<p>

Throughout extensive mutational studies we have not paid much
attention in our laboratory to those genetic changes which are
expressed not earlier than in tlhe generative phase.  Nevertheless,
the axillaris-mutant was found three times. According to our crossing
results these three types are allelic, though they differ in the
expressivity of the critical characteristic. The mutant ax3 which
showed up (as M 45/15) after 14 kR of X-irradiation on seeds presoaked
for 24 hrs, exhibits an abnormal branching in almost every flower.
Mutant ax4 was induced (as M 41/61) by 4 hrs treatment of presoaked
seeds with 0.1% ethylene imine; it is phenotypically alike ax3 except
that in starts flowering 2-3 days later.  The expressivity of ax5,
however, is much lower, many flowers showing normal white petals and
no or only a single extra bud. The above description of USMANOV as
well as the Figure 7 given by McKELVIE (1962) fits best to the
phenotype of this allele ax5 which was induced by the same chemical
treatment as ax4.<p>

During the whole vegetative growth period our three axillaris-mutants
are entirely of wild-type appearance.  At flowering stage ratios of
segregation in F2's were 24, 1% ax3-types among 838 and 26,1%
ax4-mutants among 829 individuals.  In Figure 1 a typical aspect of
the ax3-mutant is shown.  It is apparent that the original 'first
order' flower forms no calyx nor petals.  But two stem leaves protrude
from its pedicle. The diagram to Figure 1 and the microscopical
section of Figure 4 indicate that the two additional flower buds
mentioned above originate from the axis of three pedicle leaves. In
general these 'second order' flowers carry a calyx with 4 sepals and
may even have single petals.  From the axis of two opposite sepals
'third order' flower buds may arise in which - like in the 'first
order' bud-only up to 6 anthers and a pistil are present.<p>

In agreement with the statement of USMANOV, this prototype of the
axillaris-mutant can vary to quite an extent.  Not only may the
'second order' flowers eventually be single or missing.  But also more
drastic deformations occur, of which the Figures 2 and 3 illustrate
two examples.  In Figure 2 the 'first order' flower shows additional 4
anthers instead of 4 sepals (or petals).  Whenever this happens, any
further development of secondary buds seems to be inhibited. Curious
enough, this flower type exclusively produces one larger pedicle leaf
only, the other being reduced to a small scale. The flower in Figure 3
apparently demonstrates a further step in the malformation compared to
the former flower.  In this case the base of the pistil is elongated
and set with a mass of buds of different size and developmental stage
ranging from almost normal flowers to those consisting merely of a
pistil and anthers.<p>

These morphological features as well as the simple genetic
determination leads us to assume that the genetic defect in the
axillaris-locus causes a relatively simple change within the array of
the various growth hormones which are known to be active during flower
morphogenesis.<p>
