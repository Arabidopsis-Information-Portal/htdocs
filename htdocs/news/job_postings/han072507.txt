Stress sensitivity of plants and ecosystems under climate change conditions

1 Postdoctoral position, 1 PhD position.

The central research question of this project is whether the resistance of 
species-rich plant communities to different stress factors will change in a 
future climate. To this end we will grow grassland mesocosms in sunlit 
controlled chambers under the present or future climate conditions, and expose 
them to a wide range of stressors: drought, water logging, nitrogen deficiency, 
and heavy metals (zinc). Stressors will be applied separately to assess dose-
response relations, but also in combination to examine their interactive impact. 
Responses to stress will be evaluated at the cell, plant and ecosystem levels. 
Candidates for the PhD or Postdoctoral position should have a strong interest in 
studying plant responses at the biochemical level (antioxidants, stress-related 
enzymes, protein oxidation, ...). 

Candidates must have a Masters degree or PhD degree in plant physiology, ecology 
or plant biochemistry, preferentially with expertise in the analysis of plant 
stress responses. Positions are for 1 year, renewable up to 4 years, depending 
on performance evaluations. Stipends are according to university regulations and 
allow for comfortable living in Antwerp.   

Send applications to Dr. Han Asard (han.asard@ua.ac.be), at the Department of 
Biology, University of Antwerp, Belgium. The tentative deadline for applications 
is July 31, or until suitable candidates have been found.
