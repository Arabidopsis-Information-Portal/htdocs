Postdoctoral position in Epigenetics 
GReD laboratory, Clermont-Ferrand, France 

A postdoctoral position is available in the Mathieu lab to study the 
molecular bases of epigenetic gene silencing in Arabidopsis. The position is 
funded by the European Research Council (ERC) for a duration of 3 years, 
ideally starting in October. 

We are looking for a highly motivated individual to join a young group and a 
research project aimed at understanding how stress impacts on gene 
silencing. Position is open to talented individuals with a record of 
scientific productivity. Applicants should have a strong background in 
molecular biology and genetics; previous experience with Arabidopsis 
research is desirable, but not essential. Candidates with a high interest in 
epigenetics are especially encouraged to apply. 
Applicants should send their cv, a description of their research experience 
and interest, and the names and addresses of 2-3 references, to Olivier 
Mathieu preferably by e-mail (olivier.mathieu@univ-bpclermont.fr).
