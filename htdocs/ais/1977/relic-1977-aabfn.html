<h2>SUMMARIZING THE STUDY OF MULTIMUTATIONS IN ARABIDOPSIS</h2><p>

The possibilities of the occurrence of multimutations and their
frequency and distribution in relation to the complex organization of
the embryo shoot apex in the dormant seeds in Arabidopsis thaliana
(L.) Heynh. were studied (Relichova, 1977).  In the present paper,
these problems were considered in their mutual relations.<p>

To induce mutations, X-rays and N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) were
applied to dry seeds.  In X2 and M2, probable mutations were studied
manifesting themselves in the seedlings by the coloration, shape and
size of cotyledons, in the height of hypocotyl and further in a wide
scale of mutant changes in mature plants both in the habitus of the
whole plant (size, speed of development) and their individual organs
(rosette, leaves, inflorescences, flowers, pods). The mutant origin of
these deviations was verified in X3 and M3.<p>

The structure of experiments facilitated to study induced mutations
both in the populations of individual X2 and M2 families and in the
populations of individual X1 and M2 families and in the populations of
individual X1 and M1 pods, and also in the population of individual X2
and M2 plants, and thus to evaluate the mutation frequency by all
three up to now current methods, i.e., the frequency of segregating X1
and M1 plant progenies (ma), and frequency of segregating X1 and M1
pod progenies (mb) and at last the frequency of X2 and M2 mutants (mc)
(Muller, 1964).<p>

This experimental schema enabled us to trace the occurrence of
multimutations in X2 and M2 because up to 3 different mutations in
individual X2 families and up to 6 different mutations in individual
M2 families appeared.  Also in the progenies of individual X1 and M1
pods up to 3 or 5, respectively, different mutations occurred.<p>

The structure of experiments permitted us also to draw certain
conclusions on the mutation rate in the initials of the apex, in our
case by means of the determination of the mean number of mutations per
genetically effective inititial of the embryo apex (m). These
conclusions were accomplished by the mean number of initials per apex
(i), estimated by means of various, more or less direct methods.  In
addition to the up to now known rough estimate of the number of
initials in integer numbers (f.i., Langridge, 1958; McKelvie, 1961),
we give also a more accurate way based on manipulating various
estimates of the mutated sector size and phenotypic ratios of standard
and mutant X2 and M2 plants. Generally,<p>

taking into consideration the frequency of families (ai) with
estimated numbers of initials i=1, 2, 3,....j) from the total number
of families tested (n).  The mean number of mutations per apex initial
(m) was determined for each X dose and MNU concentration in various
ways of estimates based on ma, mb, and mc (Ivanov, 1973; Muller, 1964,
1965a, 1965b; Frydenberg, 1963; Gaul, 1963).  At the same time, we
proposed a new formula for the calculation of m on the basis of ma
considering the occurrence of more mutations per apex:<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol14/vol14-pg64-fig2.gif">Click here for figure</a><p>

where x' is the mean number of mutations per segregating apex, and its
common form:<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol14/vol14-pg64-fig3.gif">Click here for figure</a><p>

which uses the mean number of mutations per apex (x) . The m values
from all doses and concentrations and all ways of determination became
.22 in X and 1.35 mutations per initial in MNU. The m values which
exceeded 1.00 in the two highest MNU concentrations testified to the
fact that multimutations were induced in high percentage in these
cases. Their proof was rendered until by the X3 and M3 analysis
according to Hansel's (1967) proposal (Relichova, 1972, 1975).<p>

It has been found that in an apex with two mutations double mutations
are about twice as frequent as chimeric apices for two mutations in
contrast with earlier expectation that the frequency of both these
cases is the same (P[2/0]= P[1/1], for explanation of the symbols see
Relichova and Cetl, 1972).  Concretely, analyzing the families
segregating for two different mutations we detect in X 5 families
derivated from the apex carrying a double mutation ([2/0]) and 2
families derivated from the apex chimerical for two different
mutations ([1/1]), in MNU there were 18 apices [2/0] and 9 [1/1].
Altogether 23 apices [2/0] and 11 apices [1/1] were found.  If also
families segregating for more than two different mutations were taken
into considerations, and all possible couples of different mutations
were regarded, the situation was very similar: in X there were found
16 cases [2/0] and 7 [1/1].  Altogether 114 cases of distribution
[2/0] and 7 [1/1].  Altogether 114 cases of distribution [2/0] type
and 58 cases of distribution [1/1] were found.<p>

Two possible explanations can be given: (1) The number of initials per
apex is limited as compared with the relatively large number of
induced mutations in this apex, considering the random distribution of
mutations among the apex initials. This explanation can be supported
by means of theoretical curves of a random mutation distribution
(Relichova, 1977).  (2) In the initial cell nucleus where one mutation
arose a further mutation occurs preferentially, so to say that the
distribution of induced mutations in the population of apex initials
is not random. Balkema (1971) assumes the validity of the latter
explanation, since two neighbour cells are not probably in the same
mitotic stage and thus their sensitivity to the mutagen is different.<p>
