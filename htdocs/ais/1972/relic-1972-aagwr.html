In the considerations about the distribution of induced mutations in
the complex shoot apex of Arabidopsis (RELICHOVA, 1972), we met with
the necessity to classify the most probable situations.  In the
following survey, we summarize some of them with a suggestion to
symbolize them:<p>

/  boundaries between initials and sectors
*  if not linked<p>

The segregation ratios given show that there are various difficulties
to distinguish between different cases in the M1 families especially
if the family size is not too large.  Even if the family size will be
much larger than it is usual (IVANOV et al., 1966), it will be uneasy
to differentiate topographically very different situtions, e.g., [1/1]
and [2/0].  Further complications can be due to (1) linkage what is
very probable in Arabidopsis with its n=5; (2) diplontic selection
between different sectors (GAUL, 1961); (3) differential gametic and
zygotic viability of induced mutations; (4) overlapping of different
sectors (MULLER, 1965); etc.<p>

For this reason, it is necessary to work with very large M1 families
and to precisely analyse them in next generations.  Only such very
laborious experiments can answer the question how is the real
distribution of one, two, or more mutations in the complex vegetative
shoot apex of treated seeds in higher plants.  This study might also
throw light on the structure of the vegetative shoot apex itself
