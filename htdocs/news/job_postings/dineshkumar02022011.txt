We are looking for highly motivated and aspiring individuals to join our 
group as a postdoctoral fellow. Our long-term goal is to understand the 
molecular mechanisms by which plant immune receptors recognize pathogens and 
mediate immune signaling. Towards this goal, we are taking multiple 
complementary approaches including forward and reverse genetic screens, 
sophisticated biochemical and imaging approaches, and innovative genomics 
and proteomics approaches*.* 



Applicants should have Ph. D degree with strong background in biochemistry, 
cell biology and molecular biology. Strong publication record is required. 
Excellent oral and written communication skills are essential. Interested 
candidates should send CV, cover letter, and career goals in a single PDF 
file to spdineshkumar@ucdavis.edu.
