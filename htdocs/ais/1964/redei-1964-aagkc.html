Vol 01:<h2>REDEI, G. P.</h2><h2>A female gametophyte factor</h2>

Factor G when present in repulsion with several second linkage group
markers gives a distorted F2 ratio.  In case of close linkage the
mutant class outnumbers that of the wild.  In coupling with the same
markers the mutant class is extremely reduced, only cross-overs show
up.  G itself does not have any other phenotypic effect. Transmission
studies indicate that ovules do not transmit G while its male
transmission may approach 30 percent. This in itself is unusual since
most abnormalities generally have higher female transmission.  In case
of the most general type of megaspore development (monosporic,
chalazal) 50 percent seed abortion would be the result if one of the
two parental spores would fail to transmit.  Actually, however about
64 percent seed set could be established i.e., 28 percent more than
expected.  Second division segregation with megaspore substitution
(Renner effect) in the two basal products of the tetrad could produce,
however, just the observed phenomenon.  Preferential segregation would
have also the same effect.  Further analysis is in progress.<p>
