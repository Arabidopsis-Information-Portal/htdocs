*Two Postdoctoral Research Associate positions in Plant Molecular Biology and 
Biochemistry *



Divisions of Biology and Molecular Biosciences

Imperial College London



Salary: approx 28, 320 pounds per annum



Two postdoctoral research positions are available to join a multidisciplinary 
team working on various aspects of bio-solar energy conversion. The first 
position (up to 24 months) is a joint appointment between the groups of Peter 
Nixon and Jim Barber and will involve the study of the mechanism of 
photosynthetic water oxidation using a combination of mutagenesis, spectroscopy 
and structural biology. Experience in protein biochemistry and spectroscopy an 
advantage.



A research position (up to 36 months) is also available in the groups of Peter 
Nixon and Bart Feys  to study the molecular basis of photoinhibition and 
photosystem two repair through the analysis of nuclear and chloroplast mutants 
of Arabidopsis and tobacco. Experience in plant molecular biology an advantage.
