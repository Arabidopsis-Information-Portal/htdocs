Vol 01:<h2>ARNOLD, C.G.</h2><h2>An x-ray mutant with eight chromosomes</h2>

An X1 (X-rayed as zygotes) among other plants which varied from the
normal Arabidopsis thaliana one plant was extremely different.  The
mutant had smaller leaves and petals, nine extraordinary thin stems;
it was nearly sterile and produced only few seeds, even after
pollination with normal pollen.  Cytological control showed 8
chromosomes. Further studies of the X1-progeny will follow.<p>
