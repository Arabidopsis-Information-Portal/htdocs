It is a common knowledge now that formation and activities of the
photosynthetic apparatus are controlled both by the chromosomes and by
the extrachromosomal systems.<p>

In this connection, the main point of investigations on the genetics
of photosynthesis now is the elucidation of the role of these systems
in the process of chloroplast formation and function.<p>

Our investigations were designed to study the effect of genotype
(nuclear mutations and a set of chromosomes) on the size and the
number of chloroplasts in mesophyll cells in plants of the genus
Arabidopsis.<p>

Chloroplasts of the primary two expanded leaves were tudied in 5
species of Arabidopsis (YUNUSOV, KASYANENKO, USMANOV, 1970) and 14
mutant strains of race Enkheim in vivo (USMANOVA, 1972)<p>

Figure 1 shows the variations in the chloroplast number and the
diameter in the cells of the plants studied compared to an increasing
number of chromosomes. Coefficient of regression (b= 0.38 +/- 0.098)
curve of the chloroplast number differs from zero (at td=4; df=3;
P=0.025).  Consequently, an increasing number of chromosomes
correlates positively to the number of chloroplasts.<p>

Figure 1: The relationship between n-number of chromosomes, diameter
of chloroplasts (dark circles) and N-average number of chloroplasts
(light circles) in mesophyll cells of 5 species of Arabidopsis<p>

Coefficient of regression of the curve for diameters 0.014 +/- 0.013
(td=1.08; df=3; P=0.38) indicates that in all species studied an
increase of the chromosome number does not affect the size of
chloroplasts. This led us to the concept that chloroplast size is
under the control of the extrachromosomal systems.<p>

A study of the 14 mutant strains revealed that nuclear mutations
statistically influenced the size and number of chloroplasts.<p>

Figure 2 represents the curve only for the chloroplast size: b=0.070
+/- 0.005; td = 14.7; df = 13; P=0.0002.<p>

A.thaliana compared to the normal; 1-14 mutants are arranged in the
order of increasing average diameter.  15-diameter of chloroplasts in
the wild type<p>

On the basis of our results and the numerous data of the litrature
(obtained for different plants: wheat, barley, maize, sugar-beet,
potatoes, etc.) the general conclusion is made that the average number
of chloroplasts in the cell is controlled by the genetic factors
localized in the nuclear apparatus.<p>

Since the data of the literature are contradictory we cannot make a
valid suggestion concerning the localization of the genetic system
controlling the size of chloroplasts.<p>
