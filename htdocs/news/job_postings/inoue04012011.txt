A postdoctoral position for studying chloroplast biogenesis in UCDavis

A postdoctoral position is available starting on or after April 1st, 2011, 
for a project on chloroplast protein translocation channel and its paralog 
in Arabidopsis. The ultimate goal of the project is to gain insights into 
the evolutionary process underlying the establishment of protein import 
machinery. The project will initially use various molecular genetic and 
biochemical tools to address several defined questions. Some of the tools 
are already available, and others need to be developed. 

The article in the following link provides some background information (note 
a typo in the first sentence of Introduction in page 168. oxidative => 
oxygenic).

Applicants must have a PhD and a strong background in molecular genetics 
with model organisms. Previous experience in chloroplast biology and protein 
biochemistry is desirable. The initial appointment is for one year and its 
renewal is highly possible, depending on the performance of the individual. 

To apply, please send a full C.V. including a brief description of research 
experience and interests, and names/email addresses of three references via 
email to:
