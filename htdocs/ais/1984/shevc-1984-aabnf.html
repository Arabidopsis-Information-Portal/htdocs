This work is a continuation of our earlier studies on generative
tissues chimerism in Arabidopsis thaliana induced at different stages
of plant development. As it was shown earlier, after irradiation of A.
thaliana plants (wild type En) at rosette stage a mutant sector size
was smaller than after irradiation of dormant seeds (Shevchenko et
al., 1975; Shevchenko and Grinikh, 1976) and of developing embryos
(Shevchenko et al., 1979). It is possible to calculate on the basis of
mutant sector size the minimal number of initial cells forming
generative tissues. Such calculations have shown that the number of
initial cells increased by the period of rosette formation as compared
with earlier stages of development.<p>

The same analysis of the mutant sector size after marking the initial
cells with mutations at later developmental stages, particularly at
the bud stage, proved to be impossible because the formation of some
siliques of the main raceme had already taken place before marking of
initial cells. That's why we applied an indirect method to solve the
problem whether the number of initial cells of generative tissues
changed between the rosette and bud stages. We tried to find out
whether the mutant sector size could be changed if the plants
irradiated at the rosette stage were grown under different conditions
in order to get an idea about activity of the initial cells for
generative tissues at the late stages of plant development.<p>

In the experiments we used seeds of wild type Co which were kindly
supplied by the Chair of Genetics and Selection of the Moscow State
University and propagated in our laboratory. The substitution of wild
type En (which was used in our earlier work since 1970) by wild type
Co was caused by the following reason: over the last four years in
wild type En controls we regularly observed death of some part of the
seedlings at cotyledon stage or after the formation of two leaves. At
the beginning of the work we compared the mutant sector size in main
racemes after irradiation of plants at rosette stage in wild types Co
and En grown under equal conditions.<p>

Plants of both wild types grown in glasses on mineral agar medium
under continuous illumination at 23-25*degrees*C were irradiated 9
days after sowing by gamma rays at dose rate of 2.6-2.7 Gy. min 1. The
plants of wild type En were irradiated by 50 Gy and those of wild type
Co by 40 Gy because it was found in the preliminary experiments that
both seeds and 9-day old plants of wild type Co were more
radiosensitive than those of wild type En. Just after irradiation the
plants with two leaves were transplanted into soil where they grew
under the same conditions of illumination and temperature. In 15
siliques of the main raceme chlorophyll deficient mutants were scored
irrespectively of their embryo size (embryo-test was used).<p>

As seen from Table 1 the mutant sector size in plants of wild types En
and Co did not practically differ. Calculated minimal numbers of the
initital cells for generative tissues of the main raceme after marking
them with mutations in 9-day old plants and subsequent growth in soil
were 5.4 and 6.1 for wild type En and Co respectively.<p>

wild types En and Co after irradiation at rosette stage (growing on
agar medium before irradiation and then in soil).<p>

To study the influence of growth conditions on the mutant sector size
after iradiation of 9-day old plants we used seeds of wild type Co. A
half of the plants were grown in glasses, another half in tubes and
then they were irradiated with 40 Gy gamma rays. the plants grown in
glasses were transplanted into soil and those in tubes continued to
grow without transplantation. the differences ovserved between plants
grown in tubes and in soil were only due to the diferent way of
cultivation.<p>

As seen from Table 2 the biomass of rosettes and racemes of plants
grown after irradiation in soil were about ten times as large as of
plants grown on agar medium.<p>

In Table 3 the data on mutant sector size in main racemes of mutant
plants grown after irradiation under different conditions are
presented.<p>

sector size in main racemes of mutant Arabidopsis plants of wild type
Co. Plants were irradiated at rosette stage.<p>

These data showed considerable influence of growth conditions on the
mutant sector size after irradiation of 9-day old plants. The plants
grown in soil possessed the mutant sector size two sizes smaller than
those grown on agar medium, the difference was significant (P>0.999).
The minimal number of the initial cells in vigorous plants (soul
culture) was 7.1 and in weak plants (agar medium) was only 3.7. Thus
in case of irradition of equal rosettes the calculated minimal number
of intiial cells differed depending on vigour or racemes. In as much
as under less favourable conditions a part of initial cells of the
apical meristem lost their activity by the time of the bud stage, the
number of initial cells, calculated after irradition at rosette stage,
characterized the bud stage but not the rosette stage. We suppose that
the minimal number of the initial cells at rosette stage at which
plants were irradiated was not less than that obtained; it could be
the same or larger.<p>
