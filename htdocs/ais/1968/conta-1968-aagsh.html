Fast neutron treated dry Arabidopsis seeds were stored at
-20*degrees*C for periods of 0 - 11 hours (1 hour intervals) and 18 -
32 hours (1 or 2 hour intervals); gamma treated seeds were stored at
the same temperature for periods of 24 - 34 hours (2 hour intervals)
and 42 - 53 hours (1 hour intervals).  For each dose of both kinds of
radiation, the regression was calculated between storage time (x) and
the number of hours needed to attain 50% germination (y), and between
storage time and average root length 100 hours after germination (z).
The results are tabulated below.<p>

Germination delay was considerably lower after neutron irradiation
than following gamma irradiation, when doses are compared on the basis
of equal survival rate.  With fast neutrons no significant storage
effect occurred within the range of storage times involved, at
20*degrees*C.  With gamma-rays, radiation effects on germination were
slightly but significantly reduced by storage (i.e., more rapid
germination); although the regression coefficients did not differ
significantly, there was a tendency towards a greater storage effect
with increasing dose. This same trend was apparent after neutron
irradiation, though not very consistently. With regard to radiation
induced root-length reduction there was, especially after gamma
irradiation, a slight enhancement with storage (negative regression)
but none of the effects were significant. These data are in agreement
with the fact that neutron effects are less modified by secondary
factors than the effects due to radiations of low linear energy
transfer (LET0, and with the fact that the modification of radiation
effects is very slight at very low temperatures.  One notes, however,
that germination is slightly advanced whereas root-growth is slightly
reduced; this suggests that processes of cell elongation (germination)
may more readily recover than those involving cell division. This
question requires more detailed study in which also storage periods of
0 - 24 hours should be included in the case of gamma treated seeds.<p>
