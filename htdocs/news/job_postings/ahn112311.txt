A Post-doctoral position available in genetics of flowering. 
Creative Research Initiative, Korea University, Seoul, Korea 


A postdoctoral researcher position is available starting immediately to 
study long-distance signaling of flowering time regulation in 
Arabidopsis at Korea University, Seoul, Korea. This is a full-time 
grant-funded position (Creative Research Initiative in Korea). The 
project will use grafting techniques and molecular genetic approaches of 
FT/TFL1 family genes in Arabidopsis. A Ph.D. degree in plant flowering 
genetics is required (especially, previous experience in grafting 
experiments in Arabidopsis). A strong background on protein structure is 
a plus. Successful applicants will be expected to show a high degree of 
research productivity, good communication skills (both oral and 
written), and an ability to work collaboratively with other lab members. 
Starting salary will be commensurate with previous experience of the 
applicant.
