Vol 01:<h2>VELEMINSKY, J., T. GICHNER, V. POKORNY, and J. SVACHULOVA</h2><h2>Structural and chemical analysis of chlorophyll mutants</h2>

In several lethal chlorophyll mutants (phenotype: albina, xantha,
chlorina) the ultrastructure of plastids has been studied electrone
microscopically in cooperation with Dr. DOBEL, Gatersleben.  The
following mutants with different blocks in the course of platid
development have been analyzed:<p>

1.  Mutants with blockade before the development of prolamellar body
(2 albinas).<p>

2.  Mutants forming the prolamellar body as a last step of development
(3 xanthas).<p>

3.  Mutants forming only long non-differentiated lamellae running
through the whole plastid (3 xanthas and 1 chlorina).<p>

4.  Mutants forming abnormal grana-like structures (1 chlorina).<p>

In group 2 two different types of prolamellar bodies were observed,
differing in the shape and constituents from which they were formed.
The prolamellar body of xantha 2695 is very similar to that already
known in the literature.  It is predominantly composed of vesicles
which also form chains running out from the prolamellar body.  The
prolamellar body of xantha 1432 is formed by short and long tubuli
(lamellae?), markedly grouped in clusters, often surrounded by a
continuous lamellae and thus sharply separated from the stroma.  The
reason for these differences is being studied at present.<p>

II.  The content of the free amino acids was studied in about 40
different chlorophyll mutants of the albina, chlorina or xantha type
each lethal in the cotyleadon stage.  No qualitative differences were
found.  In the majority of mutants an abnormal accumulation of amides,
especially asparagine or the basic amino acids arginine, histidine and
lysine, valine, tyrosine etc., has been observed.  Some differences,
however, between mutants have been found in the quantiative content of
some amino acids.  Extensive analyses on the occurrence of these
differences are underway.<p>
