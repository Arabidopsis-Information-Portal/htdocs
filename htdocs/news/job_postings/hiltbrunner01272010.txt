A Postdoc position (E13) is available at the Centre for Plant Molecular
Biology (ZMBP), Tubingen, Germany.
The successful candidate will work in a research team studying the
phytochrome system in Arabidopsis. Phytochromes are red/far-red
photoreceptors, which play an important role in plant development. The
project will focus on molecular and genetic aspects of phytochrome
signalling and include the identification of components involved in signal
transduction. Please have a look at our webpage (www.plantphotobiology.org/)
or see our recent publications for further information (Hiltbrunner et al.,
2005, Curr. Biol. 15: 2125-2130; Hiltbrunner et al., 2006, Plant Cell
Physiol. 47: 1023-1034; Genoud et al., 2008, PLoS Genet. 4: e1000143).
Highly motivated candidates with a PhD in Molecular Biology or Biochemistry
are encouraged to apply; experience in performing yeast two hybrid screens
is a plus. Applications, including CV, a brief statement of research
experience and interests as well as contact information of two referees,
should be submitted by EMAIL to Dr. Andreas Hiltbrunner (
andreas.hiltbrunner@zmpb.uni-tuebingen.de).
The university is an equal opportunity employer.
