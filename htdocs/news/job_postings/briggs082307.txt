POSTDOCTORAL POSITION: Physiological, biochemical, and cell biological studies 
of the plant blue-light receptors phot1 and phot2.

A postdoctoral position is available immediately to study the regulation of signal 
transduction in the various pathways activated by the photoexcitation of the phototropins 
phot1 and phot2. The position is for one year with the possibility of continuing for a 
second year. Stipend will be commensurate with experience. The successful candidate 
should have biochemical skills and some knowledge/experience with photobiology,  as 
well as a strong background in plant biology including experience with Arabidopsis. 
Collaborative skills are also essential.

Please send a cover letter outlining your research interests and career goals, a current  
curriculum vitae plus publication list, and the names and email addresses of three
