Plant Biology/Bioenergy Faculty Position 

The Department of Biology at The Pennsylvania State University invites applications for a tenure-
track faculty position at the Assistant or Associate Professor level in Plant Biology, with research 
at the molecular, cellular, genetic or systems level relevant to plant-based bioenergy. This 
includes, but is not limited to, fundamental research on plant cell walls, control of carbon 
allocation, and other topics of basic plant biology connected with energy storage and utilization by 
plants. PSU is an international center for plant biology research, with an outstanding 
interdisciplinary plant biology graduate program ([1]http://www.huck.psu.edu/education/plant-biology) 
and excellent core facilities ([2]http://www.huck.psu.edu/facilities), including bio-imaging, 
genomics, and proteomics. PSU is the lead institution for the Center for Lignocellulose Structure and 
Formation ([3]www.lignocellulose.org), a DOE-fundedEnergyFrontiersResearchCenter, and applications 
relevant to this center are particularly encouraged. Prospective candidates should have a strong 
record of research accomplishments, ability to secure extramural grants, and a commitment to teaching 
undergraduates. Interactions and collaborations with established research programs at PSU are 
strongly encouraged. Candidates should email a letter of application, curriculum vitae, research 
prospectus, statement of teaching interests, and names and contact information of at least three 
references, all as a single PDF document, to [4]plantenergy105@bio.psu.edu. Publications and 
manuscripts (not more than three) may also be submitted as separate PDF documents along with the 
application. Review of applications will begin 15 September, 2010.
