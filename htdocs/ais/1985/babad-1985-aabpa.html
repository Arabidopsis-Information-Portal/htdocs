Investigation of mutant forms of plants with different types of
variation of structure and function of photosynthesis permits to clear
up the regulative features of activity of the photosynthetic key
enzyme of ribulose-diphosphate-carboxylase (RDPC, C 4.1.39). The
productive mutant triplex of wild type race Enkheim is a good object
for the study. We carried out the comparative investigation of the
amount of protein, the amount and the activity of RDPC in the process
of purification of extracts from the leaves of wild type Enkheim and
of its mutant triplex. In the process of purification we applied the
methods of protein fractionation by ammoniumsulphate, of
gel-filtration and of gel-chromatography. The amount of protein and
the enzyme activity were estimated after every purification procedure.
The amount of protein was defined by Lowry method (Lowry, 19512), and
the enzyme activity by radiometric measurement (Romanova, 1980).<p>

The results are represented in Table 1. The amount of protein in the
extract of mutant triplex is 14 percent more than that from leaves of
wild type Enkheim. This difference is observed at all stages of
purification. The yield of protein after the gel-chromatogarphy
through sephadex G-200 is 14.5-14.3 percent, i.e., equal for both
genotypes, but the amount of protein from leaves of mutant triplex is
12 percent higher than that from leaves of wild type race Enkheim. In
the process of purification the specific activity of enzyme increases
and after the last procedure of purification it is equal to 0.7 U/mg
of protein for Enkheim and 0.9 U/mg of protein for triplex. The mutant
activity of RDPC is 30 percent in the extract and 28.5 percent after
the purification higher than the wild type activity.<p>

Table 1: Purification of ribulose-diphosphate-carboxylase (RDPC) from
leaves of A. thaliana race Enkheim and its mutant triplex.<p>

Estimating the enzyme activity for 1 g of damp weight of leaves or for
the total amount of protein, these differences increase, i.e., mutant
triplex exceeds significantly the race Enkheim both in the amount and
in the activity of RDPC, irrespectively of the degree of enzyme
purification.<p>

Thus, the results obtained permit us to conclude that the increase of
photosynthetic intensity and the productivity of mutant triplex, side
by side with other factors (Yakubowa et al., 1980), are conditioned by
the increase of protein amount and by the activity of RDPC.<p>
