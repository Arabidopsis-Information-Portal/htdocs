	Since MATHER (1955) pointed out that in general the date of flowering in plants interacts strongly with the environmental conditions this has been proven in many species.  It means that the difference between certain phenotypes associated with a given difference of genotypes varies with the environment.<p>

	In Arabidopsis thaliana as a winter annual plant (LAIBACH, 1965), not only does the time of flowering but also the number of leaves and side branches on the main stem interact with varying temperatures (NAPP-ZINN), 1961; LANGRIDGE, 1962) as well as with changes in the photoperiod (HARER, 1950).  Papers by Van der VEEN (1965), NAPP-ZINN (1962) and BARTHELMESS (in preparation) show that the number of genes governing flowering time is limited and that it should be possible to isolate the factors exhibiting major influences and to study their special behaviour towards different environmental conditions in detail. Thus Arabidopsis could be a very good model with which to study the interactions which exist for instance in all our winter cereals between the length of the photoperiod and the cold requirement on one hand and the resulting cold resistance on the other, relations which are very difficult to study under field conditions. To this concept the author wishes to add a few further details.<p>

	Out of the cross between the races Catania st. beh. and Catania w. beh. two lines have been selected for early flowering and either many (A) or few (B) side branches (BARTHELMESS, 1964).  After one generation of outcrossing inbetween these two lines a set of F2 populations (12 populations in each line) was derived which again were studied for the expression of the two characters, but this time under spring/summer conditions and autumn/winter conditions* as well.  It turned out that the same set of F2 populations behaved completely different under the chosen environments as is demonstrated in the following table:<p>

	Under summer conditions the difference between A and B is not very obvious in these F2 populations (though the number of side branches is significantly different when compared within flowering-age classes).  But the A and B groups react entirely different when brought up under winter conditions:  Besides the much higher flowering age in both groups, B is about 50% later than A and has nearly twice as much side branches as A.<p>

	In addition, selection has been practised for early flowering and many (A) or few (B) side branches respectively on these F2 populations under the different conditions.  This gave rise to entirely different offspring groups.  When grown together under spring/summer conditions in the following year, none of the 74 winter selections was as early as the earliest control population (= selection lines without intercrossing) while one third of the 70 populations selected under summer conditions flowered earlier than the earliest control population.<p>

The next table shows the average means:<p>

	Thus selection under different environments out of the same set of F2 populations led to different results in respect of flowering time according to genotype-environment interactions. The result in respect of the number of side branches also proved to be different though not very easily describable as the surpassing of the control level happened in different flowering age classes.  (Further details see BARTHELMESS, in preparation, 1967.)<p>

	Conclusion:  Populations as the ones described above or even more appropriately selected genotypes should be very helpful to clarify the following questions:<p>

	(a)  Do all the different genes concerning flowering time show interactions, and when; will they exhibit them either with the photoperiod or low temperatures alone or with both; and which genes will influence in addition via pleiotropy the behaviour of the side branches on the main stem?  (The different reactions of group A and B under winter conditions demonstrate that entirely different behaviour is possible.)<p>

	(b)  This should be an excellent experimental material to specify by means of single genes the theory of correlated characters by FALCONER (1960) who establishes that a character selected under different environmental conditions should be regarded as a sepaate character in each environment because selection may act on an entirely different set of genes in each of the environments under consideration.<p>

	(c)  In the special case where a race which exhibits heterosis when crossed to others like Catania w. beh. is involved one could check not only the epistatic relations between different genes but at the same time analyse which of the genes influencing flowering time are also involved in creating heterosis.  Preliminary data suggest that some of the genes are inactive in this respect while others display quantitatively varying effects in the induction of heterosis.<p>
