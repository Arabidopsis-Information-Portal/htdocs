In order to isolate nitrate reductase-less mutants of Arabidopsis more
chlorate resistant mutants were isolated.  Besides the chl-2 type
(previously reported, OOSTINDIER-BRAAKSMA and FEENSTRA, 1972) one more
nitrate reductase-less mutant was isolated.  Further experiments
will have to reveal whether this mutant concerns the gene chl-2 or
not.<p>

The 16 other new chlorate resistant mutants appeared to have a
nitrate reductase activity equal to or higher than wildtype.
Complementation tests were carried out with 5 of these mutants, all
showed no complementation with the chl-1 mutant, which suggests that
these mutations probably affect the same gene.<p>

Linkage experiments showed that chl-1 is linked with an giving 14%
recombination, and that chl-2 is linked with er, giving 12%
recombination.  Therefore chl-1 belongs to linkage group 1, and chl-2
to linkage group 2 of REDEI.<p>

To study the induction of synthesis of nitrate reductase, submerged
culturing (as described by REDEI and PERRY, 1971) on different
nitrogen sources was tried.  The experiments showed that growth of
plants in liquid media depends on the presence of nitrate, although it
was possible to starve plants of nitrogen for a few days without
loss of activity of the control enzyme glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6PD).  When plants of 7 days old (in nitrate medium)
were starved for nitrogen, the nitrate reductase activity dropped
within 36 hr. to about 0, and after addition of nitrate the normal
activity was recovered within 6 hr.  Submerged culturing in liquid
medium seems promising to further investigations on induction and the
effect of inhibitors there on.<p>
