Some DNA base analogues are known to promote flower initiation of
Arabidopsis thaliana. Hirono and Redei (1966) have demonstrated that
BUdR as well as BCdR 1) promoted flowering, and their effect was
nullified by the corresponding normal nucleosides. On the other hand,
Brown (1962) has reported that the promotional effect of IUdR was not
reversed by thymidine. Kranz (1981, 1982) has postulated from the
study on the interaction of BUdR and thymidine in relation to
interfering light, that BUdR works via thymidine pathway on the DNA
synthesis.<p>

The present study was undertaken to examine the interaction between
BUdR and some nucleosides and nucleotides on the flowering into more
detail, and to clarify the role of BUdR through the nucleoside pathway
in DNA synthesis.<p>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<p>

The recessive monogenic mutant hy-2 of Arabidopsis thaliana was used
in all experiments. The hy-2 mutant has no phytochrome during its
seedling stage (Koornnef et al., (1980) and flowers earlier than wild
type both in long and short day photoperiods.<p>

The seeds were sown on mineral agar medium fortified with 2% sucrose
(Redei, 1965) in 9 cm Petri dishes after sterilized with 1/5 diluted
sodium hypochlorite solution. They were placed in cold room
(4*degrees*C) in the dark for 24 hours, followed by germination at
25*degrees*C under a 8 hours photoperiod (12, 40W fluorescent lamps,
about 1000 micro W/cm 2) for 4 days.<p>

Twenty seedlings were placed on 30 ml mineral agar medium as mentioned
above including the test compounds and/or their combinations in a 9 cm
Petri dish (4 cm height), and incubated under the short-day (8 hrs)
photoperiod at 25*degrees*C. There was an average of 80-100 plants
(4-5 dishes) per treatment.<p>

Developed flower buds were determined by naked eye at desired
intervals during 30 days after incubation.<p>

RESULTS<p>

Table 1 shows the effect of three bromo base analogues on flowering.
Only BUdR, the DNA base analogue, promoted flowering markedly, while
bromouridine and bromouracil, the RNA base analogues, had no effect on
flowering. This result suggests that BuDR is involved in DNA synthesis
controlling the flower initiation.<p>

Figure 1: The effect of BUdR, thymidine and their combination on the
time of flowering. Thymidine had no effect (10E-4M) or promoted weakly
(10E-5M). However, the promotive effect of BUdR was weakened when
thymidine was present in the medium together with it.<p>

Figure 2: The interaction between BUdR and dU on the time of
flowering. The promotive effect of BUdR decreased when dU was present
together, similar to the case of thymidine. Weak promotion by dU
itself was observed.<p>

Figure 3: The interaction between BUdR and dTMP on the time of
flowering. The promotive effect of BUdR was markedly weakened by
10E-5M and nullified by 10E-4M dTMP, although dTMP itself had no
effect.<p>

Figure 4: The interaction between BUdR and dUMP on the time of
flowering. The effect of BUdR was weakened also by dUMP, but its
nullifying activity was lower than dTMP (see Figure 4).<p>

Figure 5: The interaction between BUdR and BUdR on the time of
flowering. FUdR severely inhibited flowering even in very low
concentration (10E-7M). However, the promotive effect of BUdR was
enhanced when it was present together with FUdR.<p>

Table 2 shows the effect of different combinations of BUdR and FUdR on
the flowering and rosette leaves developed until the appearance of
flower bud. The highest frequency of flowering occurred at the
combination of BUdR 10E-4M and BUdR 10E-8M where the number of rosette
leaves was about one leaf less than that of the control.<p>

Table 2: Effect of the combination of BUdR and BUdR on the frequency
of flowering (%) and the number of rosette leaves (in parenthesis).
Plants with developed flower bud were determined at 15th day after
incubation. The number of rosette leaves was counted when all plants
developed flower bud.<p>

DISCUSSION<p>

The hy-2 mutant is a favourable material for study of the
morphogenesis mediated by phytochrome because of its lower amount of
phytochrome and earlier flowering time. However, since this mutant
responds to photoperiodic stimulations, some active phytochrome may be
produced in developed plants.<p>

Arabidopsis plants develop flower bud earlier under long-day condition
and total darkness than under short-day condition, suggesting that
certain inhibitory system of flowering works during the non inductive
photoperiods (Redei and Acedo, 1976; Goto, 1981, 1982). Since delayed
flowering under short day photoperiod is hastened by BUdR, it may
decompose or inactivate the inhibitory system. The RNA base analogue
had no effect on the time of flowering, indicating that BUdR, the DNA
base analogue specifically acts through the change in normal DNA
synthesis.<p>

Present experiment showed that all of the tested DNA precursors
reduced the promotive effect of BUdR. This may indicate that these DNA
precursors compete with BUdR.<p>

From the putative pathway of DNA synthesis (Figure 6, after Kranz,
1982), it can be postulated that (1) BUdR inhibits thymidilate
synthetase activity and reduces the incorporation of corresponding
nucleosides and/or nucleotides into DNA, forming decoded DNA, which
may disorder the normal expression of the inhibitory system of
flowering. BUdR may inhibit thymidilate synthetase more severely than
BUdR, resulting in complete suppression of the synthesis of dTMP from
dUMP. Consequently, much more BuDR replaces thymidine in DNA and
causes to stop almost completely the gene expression of the inhibitory
system of flowering.<p>

flowering (after Kranz, 1982).<p>

Since BUdR promotes flowering even under the total darkness in some
Arabidopsis line (Goto, unpublished) the inhibitory system of
flowering may function regardless of light regime. This system in the
short-day photoperiod may be more active than that in the long-day
photoperiod and in the total darkness.<p>

Redei and Acedo (1976) have found that plants grown on the medium
containing 14-C amino acids plus BUdR bind the label more tightly to
the chromatin (non-histone protein) than in the absence of the
analogue. We plan to investigate the inhibitory system of flowering
associated with the specific protein capable of intensive binding to
DNA, and with the mitotic activity of the meristems of shoot apex,
where IUdR enhanced DNA synthesis after temporally inhibition (Brown,
1972).<p>
