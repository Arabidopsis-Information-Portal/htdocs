Postdoctoral position in Epigenetics 
CNRS (UMR 6247), Clermont-Ferrand, France 

We are looking for a postdoctoral researcher to study the molecular bases of epigenetic gene 
silencing as part of a project funded by the European Research Council (ERC). 

The successful candidate will join a young research group and a project aimed at getting a better 
understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing DNA methylation patterns. 

Position is open to highly motivated individuals with a strong background in molecular biology and 
genetics. Previous experience with Arabidopsis research is a plus and a high interest in epigenetics 
is necessary. The position should ideally start in October 2011. 

Applicants should send their CV, a description of their research experience and interest, and the 
names and addresses of 2-3 references, to Olivier Mathieu preferably by e-mail
