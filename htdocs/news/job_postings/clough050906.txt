JOB TITLE
NSF-funded Postdoctoral Research Associate

JOB DESCRIPTION
Seeking an individual to assume a leadership role in the genetic and molecular characterization of soybean 
response to microbial interactions with an emphasis on nodulation and how plant response to symbiotic 
interactions differ from response to pathogenic interactions. The project will focus on functional analyses 
of genes identified from Affymetrix and cDNA microarray analyses in soybean roots and root hairs in response 
to Bradyrhizobium japonicum inoculation. Analyses may include the use of various molecular techniques such as 
gene fusions, RNAi, and over expression to functionally characterize responsive genes of interest, as well as 
additional microarrays of specific treatments.

EDUCATION
Ph. D. in genetics, molecular biology, plant pathology or a related discipline is required.  Expertise in plant 
molecular biology, plant-microbe interactions, genomics, tissue culture, and statistics is desirable, as are 
skills in written and oral communications and a demonstrated desire and ability to conduct independent research.

SALARY
$32-35,000 per year, commensurate with training and experience.  Funding is for three years assuming yearly renewal.

STARTING DATE
July 1, 2006 or when a suitable candidate is available.

CLOSING DATE
For full consideration applications will be reviewed starting May 31, 2006 and will be continuously reviewed 
until the position is filled.

APPLICATIONS
Interested persons should send curriculum vitae, copies of transcripts and the names and telephone numbers or 
e-mail addresses of three references to:
