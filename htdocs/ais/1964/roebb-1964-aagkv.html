Vol 01:<h2>ROBBELEN, G.</h2><h2>A chlorophyll mutant without plastid grana</h2>

Generally the deficient synthesis of leaf pigments in the so- called
"chlorophyll mutants" coincides with a more or less drastic reduction
in chloroplast differentiation.  According to some initial electrone
microscopical investigations ROBBELEN (1959) established a model
including the various blockades in the reaction chain of development
of chloroplast ultrastructure known up to that time.  This model
proved to be valid for several other chlorophyll mutants investigated
in Arabidopsis in the meantime.<p>

A principally new aspect, however, resulted from the electrone
microscopical analysis of a new xantha mutant.  In this genotype, V
81, chloroplasts were found for the first time with a genic blockade
at the last stage of differentiation, i.e., just before grana
formation.  The chloroplasts, regular with regard to all the residual
structural elements, are traversed by entirely uniform lamellae.
These lamellae exist in the same number as known for the normal
chloroplast, but only fail to organize grana- and intergrana areas.<p>

The mutant chloroplasts are photosynthetically active; under certain
conditions of plant growth starch granules can be deposited.  At any
rate the mutant can grow up to maturity, though rather delayed.  A
more thorough ultrastructural and physiological analysis of this
genotype appears to be of special interest for an understanding of
development and function of the grana in chloroplasts of higher
plants.<p>
