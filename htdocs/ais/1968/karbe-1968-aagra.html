<h2>Variation of plant size and other morphological characters in natural populations of Arabidopsis</h2><p>

Arabidopsis is well known to be strictly autogamous under greenhouse
conditions. Seed samples collected from wild populations, however,
frequently produce variable progenies.  In the LAIBACH collection (cf.
ROBBELEN, 1965) many of the "natural races" kept in the greenhouse for
a long series of generations still appear heterogenous in various
traits.  Single plants often gave rise to different, but homogenous
offsprings, while others "segregated" even after recurrent selection.
The idea has been mentioned several times in the past (cf. the
preceding paper of Mrs. JONES in this issue) that wild populations of
Arabidopsis can be composed of different "pure lines" as well as of
hybrids between them.<p>

By the way of other projects an experiment was run to test this
situation.  In the spring of 1967 seeds were harvested from single
plants within a small field of winter wheat in the south of Gottingen,
near Holtensen. A random sample of 40 progenies of this population
"Hl-2" was grown in the greenhouse - each family, derived from a
single plant, in a row of 8 pots.  The diameter of the full grown
rosette and the number of days to flowering were determined.  The data
for the latter character are in perfect agreement with those of the
preceding paper and, therefore, need not to be given here in detail.<p>

FIgure 1: Different homogenous single plant progenies of the Hl-2
population.  Note, at the left, e.g., the light colour and the smooth
margin of the leaves in Nr. 18 or the broad leaves and early flowering
in Nr. 45.  (The plants were heavily sprayed with a fungicide.)<p>

in rosette size<p>

The morphological variation between and within the families, on the
other side, illustrates the same facts at an additional level.  25 of
the 40 families were phenotypically as uniform as any "pure line" can
be.  The graph in Figure 1 indicates the distribution of frequencies
of the rosette diameter of 6 such homogenous families.  The result was
confirmed by an analysis of variance which, however, revealed
significant differences between those families.  Not only the rosette
diameter, but also the number, shape, margin, or colour of the leaves
differed characteristically (see photograph of Figure 1).<p>

Figure 2 presents another group of 9 families out of this population
of Hl-2 in which the phenotypic criterions were highly variable.  Some
of those curves could easily be fitted into the scheme of simple
mendelian segregations of a heterozygous mother plant.  Seeds of
single plants were harvested to investigate this possibility in a
progeny test; but this experiment is at the moment not yet ready for
evaluation.  It appears very probable, however, that the chance for
cross-pollination (or mutation?) under natural conditions is much
higher in Arabidopsis than expected ever before. This is the more
surprising as the stand in the tested population was very loose (in
1967!) with distances of many meters between the different plants or
clusters of a few individuals. The variability of the remaining 6 of
the tested 40 families ranges in between the two groups mentioned. The
rosette diameters within these families were more or less continuously
scattered over a larger scale within these families.  More complex
analyses would thus be needed to trace this kind of variabiity back to
its origin.<p>
