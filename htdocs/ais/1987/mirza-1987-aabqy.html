The plant growth regulator 2, 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4-D) is
an important selective herbicide. As a synthetic counterpart of
indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), 2, 4-D has widely been used in biological
assays. In young seedlings of Phaseolus vulgaris, sublethal
concentration of 2, 4-D induced generation of bizarre leaf form,
including funnel shaped and tubular shaped leaves (Pereira and Dale,
1982). In this paper, the effects of 2, 4-D on the rosette development
of wild type (WT) and an auxin-resistant dwarf mutant of Arabidopsis
thaliana are compared and described.<p>

The mutant Dwf was induced and isolated in Arabidopsis thaliana L.,
ecotype Landsberg, erecta mutant (Maher and Martindale, 1980; Mirza
and Maher, 1980). Preliminary details of the mutant Dwf have been
given by Mirza and Maher (1985). The mutation in the homozygous state
(Dwf/Dwf) is lethal beyond seedling stage, but the progeny of
heterozygous plants (Dwf/dwf+) segregate to give dwarf and wild type
seedlings in a 3:1 ratio. Compared to WT, Dwf seedling roots exhibit
2000-fold increased resistance to 2, 4-D.<p>

Seedlings of Dwf progeny were germinated and grown (at 25 +/-
1*degree*C) in Petri dishes containing perlite which was moistened
with the mineral medium described by Oostindier-Braaksma and Feenstra
(1973) and supplemented with 1 micro M 2, 4-D. During incubation,
constant illumination was provided from white fluorescent tubes with
photon flux density of 150 micro C mE-2sE-1. Seedlings were also grown
in control dishes without 2, 4-D.<p>

After 10 days incubation, the rosette growth of both Dwf and WT
seedlings was reduced in dishes containing 2, 4-D. At this stage both
types of seedlings seemed to be equally affected. However, after 15
days incubation, the rosette growth of Dwf seedlings was apparently
much more affected compared to WT seedlings (Figure 1). In Dwf
seedlings, rosettes showed extensive abnormal development and in most
cases their leaves fused together completely in a girdle around the
shoot apex forming a funnel-shaped or tubular-shaped structure leaving
the apex at the bottom fo the cup-shaped development. On the other
hand, WT seedlings did not form funnel-shaped or tubular-shaped
structures, although their leaves were sometimes deformed.<p>

The effects of 2, 4-D on the rosette development of Dwf are similar to
those observed in Phaseolus vulgaris (Pereira and Dale, 1982).
However, in view of the very high resistance of Dwf roots to 2, 4-D,
it is difficult to explain why rosette leaves of Dwf seedlings are
more affected by 2, 4-D than those of WT seedlings.<p>

The effects of 2, 4-D on the rosette development of an auxin-resistant
mutant (Dwf) and wild type WT seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana were
observed. The rosette leaves of Dwf seedlings grown on perlite with 1
micro M 2, 4-D, were fused completely around the shoot apex to form
cup-shaped or tubular shaped structures. In contrast, wild type
seedlings did not form such abnormal stuctures although their leaves
were sometimes deformed.<p>
