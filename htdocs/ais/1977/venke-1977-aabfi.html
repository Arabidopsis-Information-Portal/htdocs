In vitro culture of Arabidopsis thaliana has been carried out by a
number of workers (Venketeswaran, 1976; Negrutiu, Beeftink and Jacobs,
1975).  This report is a continuation of the in vitro studies carried
out on the im mutant and describes the establishment of excellent
tissue cultures in solid and liquid media. Plating experiments using
liquid suspension of cells and regeneration of buds and plantlets are
described. A detailed report will be published later.<p>

Seeds of Arabidopsis im mutant M2 were kindly supplied by Professor
G.P. Redei and standard procedures of tissue culture techniques were
employed (Venketeswaran and Mahlberg, 1962).  Surface-sterilized seeds
were germinated in Petri dishes on an agar (0.6%) solid culture medium
containing major and minor minerals + B-vitamin mixture as used by
Murashige and Skoog (1962), and 3% sucrose. The growth substances used
for callus culture experiments were 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,
4-D), *alpha*-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), 6-furfurylamino purine
(2iP) at varying concentrations of 0,1 mg/l to 5,0 mg/l.  Callus
induction in solid media: Seeds or young seedlings (4-6 days old) were
placed on the solid agar culture medium in Petri dishes containing 1
mg/l of kinetin and 1 mg/l of 2,4-D. They were maintained in a culture
room at 25 +/- 1*degree*C under continuous light. Germinated seedlings
showed varying degrees of pigmenation in the cotyledons ranging from
green to variegated green and white, and white. Callus induction was
generally observed within l week and continued proliferation
eventually produced excellent callus material. Careful examination of
the induced callus revealed patches of white callus areas, and a
mixture of white and green callus regions. The callus areas could be
isolated and transferred to individial test tubes of Petri dishes on
different media for further experiments.  Further, growth maintained
the callus pigmentation. White callus cells did not show any presence
of green plastids whereas the cells in green or in mixture of green
and white areas showed a mixture of green and white plastids.  It
appears possible to adjust and obtain the nature of pigmenation by
appropriate manipulation of the growth substances, as carried out in
pigmented and nonpigmented strains of tobacco (Venketeswaran, 1965 and
1966). This will be specifically advantageous in the selection of
strains and possible cloning for other genetic experiments.<p>

Liquid suspension culture: Young germinated seedlings or calli which
has been growing in agar solid medium for 3-4 weeks were transferred
to liquid culture medium of the same composition and same
concentration as used for solid cultures in 125 ml Erlenmeyer flasks.
The flasks were maintained in the culture room in a rotary shaker at
approximately 50-60 rpm.  Young seedlings proliferated into calli and
subsequently the callus dispersed into smaller cell clumps.  Once
established in the liquid medium, the liquid suspension cultures grew
well and produced masses of cell clumps and individual cells. The
liquid cultures appeared white to white-brown but never green. The
number of viable cells in the suspension was very high and therefore,
the system was very adaptable for plating experiments.<p>

Plating experiments: After appropriate filtration through 2-3 layers
of cheese-cloth, 1 ml of liquid suspension containing individual cells
and cell aggregates were plated on agar plates with 1% agar.  In 7-8
days' time, distinct colonies of cells appeared visibly. The size of
the colonies varied with the filtration procedure depending on the
number of single cells or cell clumps. Various manipulations could be
carried out.<p>

Regeneration of buds and plantlets: To achieve the regeneration of
buds and plantlets solid agar media were supplemented with BAP or 2iP
at concentrations ranging 0,1, 0,5, and 1,0 mg/l.  All these media
contained in addition 0,l mg/l NAA. Both plating of suspensions of
cells and cell aggregates or inoculation of calli pieces were
attempted. The inocula appeared white in color and it was difficult to
determine whether they contained a mixture of white and green cells.
This is of particular importance and could be controlled in future
experiments.<p>

At a concentration of 0,5 mg/1 BAP + 0,1 NAA or 0,5 mg/1 2iP with or
without NAA, buds and plantlets (no roots) were visible after 3-4
weeks culture in many inoculums and in many Petri dishes.  In one
Petri dish (0,1 mg/l 2iP + 0,1 mg/1 NAA) each inoculum produced 30-40
roots with many laterals having distinct root hairs deep into the agar
medium. This was particularly visible through the underside of the
Petri dish.  The buds and the leaves of the young plantlets both
appeared variegated with green and white patches.  No definite pattern
of variegation was obvious. This is of particular importance because
the ultimate aim of these experiments is to obtain totally-visible
green plants or totally-visible white plants which may give more
information of the genetic stock of the material.<p>

Because of the significant importance of Arabidopsis in somatic cell
genetics (ref. Meeting VII of the 2nd International Symposium on
Arabidopsis Research, 1976), and particularly the role of the im
mutant (Redei, 1965, 1967, and 1974), the present study is of
particular interest.  Further studies are in progress.<p>
