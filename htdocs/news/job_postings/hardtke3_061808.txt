A Ph.D. student position is available starting immediately in the lab of Christian Hardtke 
at the Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Lausanne, Switzerland. Our 
department offers excellent research infrastructure combined with a lively, interactive 
and international scientific community, located in the beautiful Lake Geneva region.

This position is part of the larger “Plant Growth in a Changing Environment” network of 
SystemsX, the Swiss Systems Biology initiative.

The candidate will work on two inter-connected sub-projects:

1. Comprehensive investigation of the genetic and environmental parameters that 
determine later stage secondary growth vigor of the Arabidopsis vasculature (building on 
Sibout et al., Current Biology, 2008; & recent progress).

2. Quantitative modeling of a hormone-controlled, multi-level feedback loop that 
determines the homeostasis of the activity of a pivotal regulator of vascular growth 
(building on recent progress).

More details about the project are available upon request.

Strongly motivated candidates with a solid background knowledge in molecular 
techniques and a strong interest in bioinformatics and modeling approaches are 
encouraged to apply.

Please forward applications including a curriculum vitae and contact information for two 
senior scientist referees by e-mail to christian.hardtke@unil.ch.
