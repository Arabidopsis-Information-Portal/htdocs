In April 1972 when Apollo 16 will start from the United States Eastern
Test Range (Kennedy Space Center) to the moon it will carry also many
thousand seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana.<p>

The Manned Space Flight Experimental Board (MSFEB) of NASA has entered
in the scientific program of the flight of Apollo 16 an european
radiobiological experiment, called "Biostack", as Life Science
Experiment M-211.  It has been selected by four Committees of American
experts because of its scientific value and its technical fitness.
The scientists participating in this experiment belong to the
"European Working Group on Space Biophysics", Europarat.<p>

The "Biostack" consists of a hermetically sealed aluminum cylinder
which contains a series of monolayers of biological material (spores
of Bacillus subtilis, egg of Artemia salina, root tips of Vicia faba
and seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana) with each layer sandwiched between
several different types of cosmic radiation track detectors (nuclear
emulsions and plastics).  The purpose of this experiment is to obtain
information on the biological effects of individual heavy nuclei of
the cosmic radiation. The results may be important for the medical
estimation of the danger of the manned space flight in future.  The
NASA hopes for an elucidation of the phenomenon of the "light flashes"
noticed by the astronauts during the preceding space flights.<p>

The fixation of the Arabidopsis seeds in foils from polyvinyl-alcohol
(PVA) between the physical detectors enables an exact coordination
between track and hit seed, consequently an evaluation of the effect
of each individual radiation particle.  Germination and growth of
Arabidopsis is not inhibited by the embedding of the seeds in PVA
alone, even after storage up to 18 months. The radiation effects will
be studied after exposure during the Apollo flight by testing the
germination of the seeds, the growth, development, and fertility of
the X1-plants, and the induction of morphological, physiological, and
biochemical mutations in the C1- and X2 generations.<p>

Already, the Biostack has passed with success the technical tests, the
Qualification test (launch vibration, shock load, and vacuum) and the
Acceptance test (dimensional check) performed by the Centre National
d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) in Paris and by the NASA Manned Spacecraft
Center in Houston.<p>
