The purine analogue 8-azaguanine (AG) is known to be incorporated into
the RNA of organisms like Bacillus cereus; it affects the synthesis of
proteins at the m-RNA level (ZIMMERMAN et al., 1967). Apart from this,
AG can also induce other harmful effects, e.g., endopolyploidy in the
cells of pea root meritems (NUTI-RONCHI et al., 1965).  The
experiments reported below were conducted to study the action of AG on
the biosynthesis of RNA by measuring the rate of incorporation of
uridine into the acido-insoluble (AIS) fractions.<p>

Labelled uridine was adjoined in the mineral medium of the culture in
all these experiments.  Seeds/plants were subjected to photoperiods of
24 hrs with a light intensity of 9000 lux; temperature was 24
+/-1.5*degrees*C and relative humidity at a level above 70%.<p>

Experiment No. 1: Lots of 100 seeds were immersed in the following
media: (1) Mineral medium (MM)+3H-uridine (25 microC/ml and (2) MM +
AG (2.5x10E-5M) +3H-uridine (25 microC/ml).  Seeds were recovered at
different intervals and were thoroughly washed with an equimolar
solution of cold uridine and then with distilled water.  The AIS
fractions were extracted by a modified method of JACOBS (1969).  The
radioactivity (Cpm = counts per min) was measured in a Tri-Carb liquid
scintillation spectrometer in a BRAY's medium. Results are presented
in Table 1.<p>

Experiment No. 2: Seeds were sown in MM and after eight days lots of
ten seedlings (C+2) were incubated in the same media as in the
previous experiment.  Seedlings of uniform size were selected and only
the root system was immersed in the solutions.  They were recovered at
different intervals of time and the AIS fractions were extracted by
the Milliporre technique (DRIESSCHE and BONOTTO, (1969). Data are
given in Table 2.<p>

Experiment No. 3: In this experiment eight day old seedlings grown in
MM were transplanted into media having different concentrations of AG,
the specific activity of the labelled metabolite being the same in all
cases (25 microC/ml).  The seedlings were recovered after four hours
and the rate of incorporation of 3H-uridine was studied as in
experiment No. 2.  The readings are presented in Table 3.<p>

From the results of these experiments it is clear that AG has an
inhibitory effect on the rate of the uridine incorporation into the
RNA of this cruciferous plant.  The exact nature of this inhibition is
being analysed.  Results of similar experiments with 3H-leucine
instead of 3H-uridine show that AG has an even more serious inhibitory
effect on the rate of incorporation of this amino acid into proteins.<p>
