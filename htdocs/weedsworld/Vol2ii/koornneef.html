This session focused on meristems in the shoots and roots.
Kathy Barton (Madison) described the shoot meristem less (STM) gene, which 
appeared to be a homologue of the maize KNOTTED  homeobox gene. This 
gene has an expression pattern extremely specific for cells that will become 
meristems or are undifferentiated shoot meristem cells. <P>
Root development has become a mature field of research in Arabidopsis. 
Elegant cell-faith and laser ablation studies (by Scheres, Utrecht) and well 
described mutants some of them affected in specific cell layers of the roots 
(Di Laurenzio and Benfey, New York), have been important tools in the 
understanding of this important plant structure. <P>
The development of leaf primordia was studied by Pickett (Eugene) with 
temperature sensitive mutants. C. Bellinni reported on new seedling 
mutants studied at the INRA in Versailles. Some of these mutants seem to be 
affected in the cytokinin response.
