<TITLE>Madison meeting review introduction</TITLE>

Here is a report on the 6th International Arabidopsis Conference, which was held at Madison, Wisconsin, June 7-11. Over 650 participants enjoyed a varied and action-packed programme of talks and over 500 posters.  <P>

I would like to take this opportunity to thank the organisers of the meeting, particularly the local organiser, Rick Amasino who had invested so much time and effort to make this such a successful meeting. Infact, Madison will be the venue again in '97 and '98. This will mean that we will have another opportunity to enjoy great science as well as good conversation and beer on the famous terrace. <P>

The report on the meeting is a collection of pieces written by the session chairpersons. I would like to thank them for their contributions and for responding so well at this very busy time of year.
