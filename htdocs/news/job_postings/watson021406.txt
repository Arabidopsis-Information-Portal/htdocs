POSTDOCTORAL POSITION
PROTEIN KINASES THAT REGULATE ROOT WAVING

Laboratory of John C. Watson
Dept. of Biology, Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, Indianapolis, IN

A postdoctoral position is available immediately to study how root waving in Arabidopsis is 
regulated by two protein kinases called WAG1 and WAG2. Experiments with knockout mutants in the 
WAG1 and WAG2 genes showed that neither single mutant exhibits a discernable phenotype in most 
analyses. However, wag1/wag2 double mutants exhibit a pronounced phenotype in seedlings grown 
on vertical agar plates: the roots have a wavy pattern observed in wild type only on plates 
inclined at pitches less than 90 degrees. The wag1 and wag2 single mutants exhibit less pronounced 
root waving on vertical plates. To elucidate the roles of WAG1 and WAG2 as negative regulators of 
root waving, we aim to: (1) Ask whether the altering expression or kinase activity of WAG1 and 
WAG2 affects the root waving response in transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings; and (2) Explore the 
underlying mechanisms for the wavy root phenotype in wag1/wag2 mutants, particularly with regard 
to gravitropism and the transport of and response to auxin. A strong background in the molecular 
biology, genetics, and physiology of Arabidopsis is necessary.

from Arabidopsis negatively regulate root waving in Arabidopsis. The Plant Journal 45 (5): 752-764.
