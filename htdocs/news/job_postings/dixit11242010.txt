Postdoctoral Position in Plant Cell Biology 

Description: A postdoctoral position is available in the laboratory of 
Dr. Ram Dixit at Washington University, St. Louis, USA. The research 
involves using a combination of standard cell biology techniques and new 
in vitro reconstitution approaches coupled to single molecule imaging to 
study the mechanisms for the spatial organization of the Arabidopsis 
cortical microtubule cytoskeleton. The cortical microtubule cytoskeleton 
acts as a scaffold for the directed deposition of cellulose and probably 
other cell wall materials. As a result, the organization of the cortical 
microtubule cytoskeleton plays a central role in cell wall assembly that 
in turn dictates cell morphogenesis and plant stature. The project will 
contribute to both basic science and bioenergy applications. For 
examples of our current work, please visit our laboratory website at 
http://biology4.wustl.edu/faculty/dixit/index.html. The laboratory 
offers a strong and dynamic research environment and the training 
program is designed to promote scientific and career development. The 
contract will be for one year and renewable based on performance. Salary 
will be commensurate with experience and NIH guidelines. 
Requirements: Applicants must have a PhD, a strong publication record 
and demonstrated expertise in molecular cell biology and/or biochemistry 
(in plant or animal systems). Experience with any of the following is 
beneficial: confocal microscopy, TIRF microscopy, protein purification 
or microfluidics. To apply for this position, please visit 
https://jobs.wustl.edu <https://jobs.wustl.edu/> and search for job ID 
number 21097. 

The application should include: 
1) A cover letter describing motivation and interest 
2) CV detailing experience and past research success 
3) Names and contact information of three references
