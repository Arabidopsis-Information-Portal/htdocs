Vol 01S: <h2>Some Developmental Features in Natural Populations of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) HEYNH.</h2><p>

I. CETL<p>

In the investigation on A. thaliana races from the collection of Prof.
F. LAIBACH (cf. ROBBELEN, 1965) it has been shown that Arabidopsis
appears to be a quantitative long day plant (LAIBACH, 1943; GREGORY
and HUSSEY, 1953) with different vernalization responses. We can
distinguish 1. early summer annual races which do not react on
vernalization, 2.  late summer annual races with a relatively low
quantitative vernalization requirement and 3. winter annual races with
a quite high but also rather quantitative requirement for
vernalization (LAIBACH, 1951; LAIBACH and ZENKER, 1954; ZENKER, 1955).
The data on the genetical determination of the developmental rate of
the vernalization requirement (HARER, 1951; DIERKS, 1958; NAPP-ZINN,
1955, 1957, 1962, 1963; VAN der VEEN, 1965) suggest the presence of
several major genes and modifiers.<p>

It has also been stated (LAIBACH, 1951; RATCLIFFE, 1962, 1964) that
there exists a relation between the geographical-climatic conditions
of the original localities and the developmental characters.  In so
far as this problem cannot be fully answered on the races in which
certain selectional changes are unavoidable we have attempted to use
for this study natural populations.<p>

In a foreoing paper (KUCERA and CETL, in press) the reaction on
vernalization and photoperiod has been quantitatively determined at
optimal growth temperatures (about 250*degrees*C) in three local
populations BP, Je, and Zb from different west-moravian localities as
compared with the race ST 56 (SOSNA, 1962; VELEMINSKY and GICHNER,
1963). Interpopulational differences caused by unequal developmental
requirements in the percentage of generative plants from unvernalized
seed and in the developmental rate of the generative plant fraction
have been found. The variability was also different and always much
higher than in the races. After seed vernalization of a corresponding
duration, the percentage rose in all the populations to 100, and the
period to appearance of the flower primordia diminished. This
behaviour shows that at the optimal temperature, plants remaining in
the vegetative state or delayed in development have a certain
vernalization requirement.<p>

Table 1: The percentage of generative plants and the developmental
rate as expressed by the mean number of days to appearance of the
flower primordia (x) in 64 local populations of Arabidopsis thaliana
(L.)  HEYNH. Experimental conditions: unvernalized seed, temperature
25 +/- 3*degrees*C continuous illumination (1250 lux), duration of the
experiment 42 days.<p>

On this basis, further experiments were carried out on 64 local
populations, the seed of which was collected in the last two years
from various localities of Czechoslowakia; 56 populations originated
from a territory occupying the lowlands of the Dyjsko-svratecky, uval
in the south-east, and the highlands of the Ceskomoravska vysocina in
the north-west, 8 populations from the northern and eastern slopes of
the mountains Hruby and Nizky Jesenik (cf. CETL. DOBROVOLNA and
EFFMERTOVA, 1965).<p>

Plants from unvernalized post-dormancy seeds were grown on soil at 25
+/- 3*degrees*C under continuous illumination (1250 lux).  These
conditions which induce rapid flowering in the summer annual types and
inhibit it in the winter annual ones make it possible to distinguish
the two main developmental types in respect to the vernalization
requirement (CETL and KUCERA; KUCERA and CETL, in press).<p>

Measurements were done: 1. in the single populations, of the
percentage of generative plants at the end of the experiments (42 days
from full germination), 2. in single generative plants, of the number
of days to appearance of the flower primordia (x), and in each
population the corresponding mean (x).<p>

The results are given in the Table 1.<p>

The percentage of generative plants is shown to be very variable,
changing in particular populations from 0 to 100. The populations with
both very high and very low portion of generative plants are much more
frequent than those with an intermediate one:<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol01S/vol01S-pg49-tab2.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

The populations containing a great majority of generative or
vegetative plants with a small part of individuals of the opposite
type (up to 20%) can be conventionally regarded as pronouncedly
"summer annual" or "winter annual", the others being called "mixed".<p>

A confrontation with the geographical-climatic conditions shows that
the "winter annual" populations originate from the lowland localities
while the "summer annual" from the highland ones. "Mixed" populations
occupy intermediate positions. The line separating the "winter annual"
and "mixed" populations corresponds approximately to the 300
m-contour, the line separating the "mixed" and "summer annual"
populations to the 400 m-contour, of course, with some exceptions. In
general, the area of the "winter annual" populations agrees with the
range of the xerotherm vegetation.<p>

There exists a highly significant positive correlation between the
height above sea-level which can be considered in the first
approximation as an expression of the geographical-climatic conditions
of a given locality and the percentage of generative plants (r+/-3 sr
= + ), 6197+),0997; P<0,0001).<p>

These data confirm that the winter annual forms are bound to the more
warm and dry lowland, the summer annual ones to the more cold and wet
highland. The very striking lack of summer annual types in the lowland
(below 240 m) seems to be connected with the danger of a premature
passing into the generative state and of a subsequent loss of the
wintering ability. The climatic conditions of the autumnal period
appear to be decisive (cf. RAZUMOV, 1961); in our lowlands, this
period is relatively long and warm. The absence of winter annual types
in the more elevated locations is less conspicuous except in the
topmost ones (above 600 m) where the shortened vegetation period delay
seed ripening and overcoming dormancy, which is--according to our
observations necessary not only for germination but also for ability
to vernalize.<p>

On the other hand, the excepted negative correlation between the
height of the locality above sea-level and the mean number of days to
appearance of the flower primordia in the generative fraction of the
"mixed" and "summer annual" populations (x) has not been proved (r+/-
3.sr = -0,1961+/-3.0,1478; P>0,05). Thus, there is only an
unsignificant tendency to the acceleration of flowering according to
the raising of localities.<p>

Figure 1 shows that there is high variability both between and within
populations in the x values. The distribution of all 46 "mixed" and
"summer annual" populations is highly discontinuous. This
discontinuity remains to be preserved even if the particulate
frequencies are being summarized for the whole material (Figure 1,
right below).<p>

Figure 1: Distribution of x values in 46 "mixed" and "summer annual"
populations of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) HEYNH.<p>

At least 11 not overlapping categories with were empirically found by
analyzing the position of individual peaks on this summary
distribution curve. The x value agrees very well with many maxima on
the distribution curves of all populations studied.<p>

It seems to be possible that these categories represent different
genotypes. In another experiment performed at the same external
conditions, the variability in the x values as expressed by the
standard deviation (s) in the most uniform repeatedly autogamized
lines from our three first populations BP, Je and Zb was found to be
agreeing with s of any of the 11 categories. This means that within
both these categories and uniform lines mentioned above, practically
all the variability of x values appears to be environmental. This
situation indicates that acording to the known data (HARER, 1951;
DIERKS, 1958; NAPP-ZINN, 1962, 1963; van der VEEN, 1965), the gene
number for the developmental rate is limited to a few. The experiments
on natural populations are being continued in more detailed studies of
developmental requirements.<p>

The results presented here indicate that natural populations of
Arabidopsis thaliana with respect to their developmental features are
rather complex entities the structure of which appears to be more or
less correlated with the environment. What role in this complexity is
played by selection, migration, hybridization, and mutation can be
solved by special methods of populational genetics. In any case, it is
clear that this "botanical Drosophila" with its different
developmental requirements repesents an excellent model object for
such an investigation, too.<p>
