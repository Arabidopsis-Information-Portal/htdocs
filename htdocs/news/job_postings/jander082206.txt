[Arabidopsis] Faculty positions at the Boyce Thompson Institute

Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research at Cornell University

BTI, an independent not-for-profit research organization, invites applications for up to three tenure-track 
faculty positions at any level. We seek candidates whose research addresses important questions in biology 
using plant, plant-microbe, or plant-herbivore systems. Research topics should be complementary to current 
research at BTI and Cornell. Particular areas of interest include plant metabolism, small molecule biochemistry, 
enzymology, ecology, and plant interactions with other organisms. Applications from scientists using model 
systems not currently represented at BTI are encouraged. BTI is located on the central Cornell campus and 
has a research-oriented environment with state-of-the-art facilities and family-friendly policies. Our 
location offers superb opportunities for interactions and formal links to appropriate Cornell departments. 
We encourage applications from women and minorities. Applicants should submit a curriculum vitae, a 
statement of research interests, and a concise description of research plans (2-3 pages). Please submit 
applications and have letters from three references sent to Gary Blissard, Search Committee Chair, Boyce 
Thompson Institute, Tower Road, Ithaca, New York 14853, e-mail: ee54@cornell.edu. Review of applications 
will begin on November 1 and will continue until the positions are filled. Additional information about 
BTI can be obtained at http://bti.cornell.edu.
