Post-Doc Dundee, Scotland 
POST-DOC RESEARCH SCIENTIST Genetics Programme, Band 6PD
Applications are invited for a highly motivated post-doc to join SCRI, to study 
regulated gene expression controlling flower development. The work in Gordon 
Simpson’s lab focuses on the regulation of gene expression in the control of the 
floral transition. The main objectives are to 
•	characterize the molecular basis by which the RNA binding protein, FPA, 
controls flowering time and 
•	characterize novel Arabidopsis and barley mutants affecting flowering. 

This post requires the individual to conduct research into the molecular basis 
of regulated gene expression controlling flowering, by designing and conducting 
experiments involving molecular biology and molecular genetics methods to 
characterise mutants.

Candidates must be highly motivated, capable of independent work and have a PhD. 
Previous experience with Arabidopsis, gene expression analysis or molecular 
genetics would be an advantage. The successful candidate should be highly 
organized and be able to work as part of an interactive team.

This position is working in a lab which is jointly supported by Dundee 
University College of Life Sciences 
(http://www.dundee.ac.uk/biocentre/SLSBOverview.htm ) and the Scottish Crop 
Research Institute (http://www.scri.ac.uk ). This interaction combines a 
stimulating research environment with state-of-the-art plant growth facilities. 

This position has approved funding for 3 years.

Informal enquiries about the position should be directed to Dr Gordon Simpson 
(g.g.simpson@dundee.ac.uk) (DO NOT SEND APPLICATIONS TO THIS EMAIL ADDRESS)

Covering letter and CV including the names and addresses of 2 referees should be 
sent to, Human Resources Office, SCRI, Invergowrie, Dundee DD2 5DA by 16th March 
2007, quoting the reference REF.
The Institute is an equal opportunities employer.
