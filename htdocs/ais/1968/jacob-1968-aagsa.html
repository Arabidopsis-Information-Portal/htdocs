There is great interest to know the quantitative evolution of the
incorporation pattern of tritiated thymidine into the DNA of
Arabidopsis meristems, among others to interpret sensitivity of embryo
seeds to mutagens and to determine the length of the mitotic cycle and
its main phases.  Some preliminary results are here reported.<p>

Seeds of Arabidopsis, Wil-2, were immersed in a solution of
3H-thymidine (3 curies/mM: Radiochemical Centre, Amersham) at a
concentration of 33 micro c/ml during increasing times up to 48 hours
and placed in an environment of continuous light at a temperature of
24 +/- 1.5*degrees*C. After washing, the extraction of acido-soluble
fractions and acido-insoluble fractions has been operated and the
amount of radioactivity measured in a scintillation spectrometer.  The
results are presented in the figure. These data indicate that after
soaking of seeds during 25 hours, penetration and incorporation
suddenly increase and reach a maximum +/- 40 hours after sowing.  The
peak would represent the first wave of cells that go through the first
metaphase. These results correspond approximately to those reported by
ROBBELEN (1965) who mentioned the beginning of DNA synthesis 30-35 hrs
and the onset of mitosis later than 36 hours after the soaking of the
seeds.<p>
