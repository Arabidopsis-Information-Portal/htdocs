(PAMIRO-ALAY) IN THE FLOWERING TIME</h2><p>

INTRODUCTION<p>

The genetic system that controls flowering time is used in the study
of variability of natural populations, and there is evidence that
Arabidopsis populations are heterogenous in this respect (Napp-Zinn,
1976; Cetl, 1976, 1979)<p>

In our opinion, interesting results were obtained by USMANOV et al.
(1978) who studied, in particular, the proportion of winter and spring
forms in Arabidopsis populations ot Tadjikistan. They found that the
relative amount of the two forms is clearly dependent upon the
exposure of the slope. Spring forms dominate in the case of northern
exposure (80%) in Kondora and 90% in Khodga-Obi-Garm) while on slopes
facing south they constitute only 10-15%. The difference, according to
the authors, is due to higher soil temperature on slopes of southern
exposure, which results in germination of Arabidopsis seeds before the
frosts come. According to Cetl (1979), Khodga-Obi-Garm populations
start flowering later than any of the Moravia populations studied.<p>

MATERIAL<p>

We have investigated four Arabidopsis populations growing under
different climatic and geographic conditions. All of them are located
on the Gissarsky mountain ridge or on Pamir but at different
altitudes, which explain why their habitats differ in the amount of
precipitation, mean annual temperature, duration of the vegetation
period, and the plant flowering time.<p>

RESULTS<p>

Climatic characteristics for the populations are presented in Figure
1. In summer of 1980 we found an Arabidopsis population in the
drainage-basin of Shakdara River, at the altitude of 3400 m. To our
knowledge, this is the highest location for an Arabidopsis population
described in the literature. At the site where the plants grow,
precipitation amounts to 120-150 mm a year, the average temperature
during vegetation is 15*degrees*C (maximum 25*degrees*C. Plants of
this population vegetate from the beginning of June to the end of
July. Figure 1 compares average monthly temperature and amount of
precipitation at the sites inhabited by all the four populations. It
can be seen that at Kondora, Khodga-Obi-Garm and Sorbo there is an
opportunity for germination of Arabidopsis seeds in autumn (monthly
temperature over 15*degrees*C and enough precipitation). In the
Shakhdara region the autumn temperature is below zero and the amount
of precipitation is negligible.<p>

Arabidopsis populations studied. (1-Kondara, 2-Khodga-Obi-Garm,
3-Sorbo, 4-Shokhdara)<p>

Seeds collected from the four populations in the same year were
planted in the greenhouse of the Institute of General Genetics
(Moscow) by the end of April, without additional illumination.
Flowering plants were counted 28 and 42 days after young growth
appeared, giving the estimate of 'normal' and 'late' plants
respectively. Plants that failed to flower by day 42 may be 'winter'
forms. The flowering time data are summarized in Table 1.<p>

Table 1: Genetic heterogeneity of natural Arabidopsis thaliana
populations with regard to flowering time.<p>

The Kondora, Khodga-Obi-Garm and Sorbo populations obviously differ
from one another in the time of flowering. Seeds from Khodga-Obi-Garm
produced more plants that came into flower by 42nd day than seeds from
the other two populations. The Shakhdara population stands completely
aloof, in particular, almost 50% of its plants were flowering by 28th
day and nearly all by 42nd day. It can be supposed that this
population lacks winter forms due to the severe climatic conditions.
The results thus suggest a considerable degree of polymorphism of
natural Arabidopsis populations with regard to flowering time, which
may be due to the broad range of climatic conditions at their
habitats.<p>
