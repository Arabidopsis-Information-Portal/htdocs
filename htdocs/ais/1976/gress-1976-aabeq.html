The potential applications of plant tissue culture in plant
improvement and basic botanical research have been emphasized
sufficiently (Chaleff and Carlson, 1974; Scowcroft, 1975; Melchers,
1976).  However, although the aims of most researchers are quite clear
in their minds, the precise way to accomplish their goal is often
hindered by technolgoical problems for example, soy bean callus does
not seem to differentiate into plantlets (Gamborg, pers. commun.:
Greshoff, unpublished).  Culture of maize and barley mesophyll
protoplasts has not been possible (Potrykus, pers. comm.).  It might
be wise to turn to plants which tend themselves more readily to cell
culture.<p>

One such plant seems to be the crucifer Arabidopsis thaliana.  We know
a lot about its biology, genetics, and physiology.  Its bioloical,
genetical and physiological background is extensive, and its tissue
culture biology is advancing steadily.  This report is on another
important technolgoical advance, namely protoplast culture and its
transformation into callus, which in turn is capable of regeneration
(Gresshoff and Doy, 1972; Negrutiu, et al., 1975).<p>

Cell culture was obtained from callus derived from seeds of the
Columbia strain, extensively used by G. Redei and other workers. The
cell line (ANU-CW-1) is characterized by relatively constant diploidy
under our culture conditions, friability ahd potential to grow in
suspension culture (Negrutiu and Jacobs, 1976, and this AIS volume).
Cultures of ANU-CW-1 also retain their potential to redifferentiate
for periods up to one year, depending on subculture schedule and media
components.<p>

Matrials and Methods<p>

Callus Induction<p>

Surface sterilized Columbia wild-type seeds were placed on ACMI B5
salts [Gamborg and Eveleigh, 1968]; sucrose, trace elements, vitamins,
iron chelate, agar, and pH [see Gresshoff and Doy, 1974]; 2, 4d [4
microM] and kinetin [0.5 microM]).  Callus formation was observed
within 14 days which was then detached and cultured on ACM2 (= ACMI,
but no kinetin).<p>

Plant formation<p>

Callus from ACM2 was transferred onto ADM 11 = (salts of Murashige and
Skoog, 1962, other media components like ACM I, but 10 microM kinetin
or 2-iP.  Callus fragments (30-50 mg fresh weight) were incubated in
the light (16h-8H dark) at 23-25*degrees*C.  After 2-3 weeks, green
primordial centers appeared which subsequently developed into complete
plantlets. Transfer of small callus attached plantlets to hormone free
B5 medium insured rooting and normal plant development.<p>

Protoplast Isolations<p>

Callus (one week after subculture) was used to isolate protoplasts.
For this, 1 g (fresh weight) was plasmolyzed in 4 ml PDB (0.25M
mannitol, 0.25M sorbitol, 1mM CaCl2, 10 mM KH2PO4, pH 6.0) for 30
minutes. The callus at this time had separated into seed-sized clumps.<p>

The cells were transferred into the enzyme digestive mix containing 2%
driselase, 2% cellulysin (Calbiochem) and 1% pectinase (Serva) made up
in 10 ml PDG.  Enzymes were freshly prepared and dialyzed to desalt
against PDB at 4*degrees* C for 3 hours.<p>

After 3-5 hours incubation at 25*degrees* in a 9.9 cm sealed petri
dish, a large yield of protoplasts was observed. These are sieved
through a 50 mm nylon mesh, washed 4-5 times with culture medium to
remove enzymes, and further purified of debris by centrifugation at
200 g for 10 minutes onto a 30% sucrose cushion.  Cleaned protoplasts
were used for culture or phage experiments.  (See Gresshoff and Rolfe,
in this AIS issue).<p>

Protoplast Culture<p>

Protoplasts were cultured in hanging 0.05 ml drops in sealed plastic
petri dishes in APM5 medium. This contained essentially the same
components as ACM1, except that 1% glucose and 1% sucrose were used as
carbon source, 0.4M mannitol was added as osmoticum, 0.1% glutamine
was added, 2,4,D was adjusted to 6 microM and kinetin to 0.05 microM.
The optimal density was at about 1000 protoplasts/0.05 ml drop.
Culture proceeded at 25*degrees*C in dark with daily replinishment of
hanging drops with fresh medium. After the 3 day culture, mannitol was
left out of the replenishing medium.  Alternatively 4 x 10 5
protoplasts were smeared as a thin layer in soft agar (0.6% Difco)
onto APM5 plates. By this procedure direct monitoring of individual
protoplats was possible.<p>

Results and Discussion<p>

The above media and methods, the best ones among many which were
tried, provide a technique by which Arabidopsis thaliana callus cells
can be stripped of their cell walls, cultured to reform the wall, and
divided to form a callus, which in turn is capable of plantlet
regeneration.<p>

Callus protoplasts regenerated into callus at a frequency of about
0.1%.  Cell wall regeneration, as verified by Calcoflour staining, was
complete in 90% of all protoplasts cultured in APM5 after two days.
First divisions were noted as early as one day, although these may
represent protoplasts from cells already in division.  The frequency
of 2-10 cell stages is considerably higher than the final yield of
calluses, which indicates that not all divisions manage to complete
the developmental sequence.<p>

Transfer of mini-calluses from hanging drops after about five weeks of
culture to solid ACM2 media, stimulated growth extensively.  Such cell
lines, when transferred to ADM11, produced plantlets in about 50% of
explants used.  Shoot formation, however, as with normal
non-protoplast derived callus, was retricted to certain areas of the
callus.  Often adjacent areas failed to green altogether. These
observations may represent diversity of the cloned cell line
introduced through the time in callus culture (7 weeks).<p>

Although the plating efficiency of ANU-CW-1 protoplasts is still low,
it nevertheless illustrates that Arabidopsis thaliana is now capable
of the complete cycle of plant-seed-callus-protoplast-callus-plant in
a period of about 14-18 weeks. Coupled with efforts to optimize the
above reported techniques and other advances in Arabidopsis tissue
culture technology, its status as "model plant" is further affirmed.<p>
