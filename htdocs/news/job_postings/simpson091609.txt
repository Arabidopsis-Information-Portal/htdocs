Postdoctoral Research Assistant 
College of Life Sciences, Dundee University 
 
GRADE 7 (£28,839 - £35,469) 
 
SUBJECT AREA: ALTERNATIVE RNA POLYADENYLATION 
A postdoc position is available immediately in the group of Gordon 
Simpson at the College of Life Sciences in Dundee, Scotland. The aim of 
this position is to dissect the mechanism by which alternative 
polyadenylation (APA) is controlled. 
You will be working in a highly international research group that is 
passionate about working with RNA. We combine questions on plant 
development with state-of-the-art analysis of RNA processing and 
collaborate with other research groups in Dundee focused on 
computational biology and human RNA biology. For more information about 
the group see: http://www.lifesci.dundee.ac.uk/groups/gordon_simpson/ 
The post-holder will take molecular genetic approaches to dissect 
mechanisms of APA control. As part of a £1 million BBSRC-funded research 
programme, the post-holder will work closely with a computational 
biologist, who will analyse next generation sequence data for APA. This 
aspect of the project is a collaboration with Geoff Barton’s group: 
http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/ therefore an ability to work well in 
a team is an important requirement of this post and a basic feature of 
Gordon Simpson’s group. 
Training, as required, will be provided in a well-equipped, well-funded 
and supportive environment enabling the successful candidate to extend 
skills and expertise. The College has excellent facilities for all 
aspects of research, including in-house and easily accessible services, 
such as cloning, proteomics, microscopy, DNA sequencing, oligo synthesis 
and preparation of growth media. State-of-the-art plant growth 
facilities are provided by SCRI. 
This position is suited for a candidate with a recent PhD and a strong 
background in RNA or Arabidopsis research, with first author 
publications in good scientific journals. The candidate should be able 
to demonstrate an aspiration to move on to an independent faculty 
position after their postdoctoral work. 
The position is available immediately and is for 3-years. The starting 
salary is a minimum of Grade 7, point 29 (£28,839). 
Dundee is a centre of excellence in life sciences research and combines 
quality of life with quality of science. It lies close to areas of 
outstanding natural beauty, including large sandy beaches and island and 
mountain wilderness. The culturally rich cities of Glasgow and Edinburgh 
can be reached in little over an hour. Rainfall charts show that Dundee 
is one of the most sunny & dry places in the UK, see:
