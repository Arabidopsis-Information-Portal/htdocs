A postdoctoral position to work on small RNAs involved in hormone signaling and plant 
development is available in the lab of Chris Rock at Texas Tech University 
(http://www.biol.ttu.edu).  The successful candidate will have first-author publications 
and expertise in small RNA biology (not necessarily in plants).  Working experience with 
in situ hybridization, transcriptomics, epifluorescence microscopy, N. benthamiana 
transient assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and bioinformatics including Perl 
programming would be a plus.  This is a full-time, 24 month appointment, renewable 
upon satisfactory progress and continued funding.  Review of applications will begin 
immediately until the position is filled.  TTU is an AA/EO employer and minorities are 
encouraged to apply.  Please send CV, letter of application with career goals, and names 
and contact info of three references to chris.rock@ttu.edu.
