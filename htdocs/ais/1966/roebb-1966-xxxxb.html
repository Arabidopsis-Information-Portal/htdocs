	G.W.M. BARENDSE:  Flower formation in Arabidopsis thaliana, strain Koln.  Experiments on the effect of gibberellic acid, kinetin and alpha-tocopherol (Vitamin E) on flowering of the cold requiring strain Koln of Arabidopsis are in progress.  It has already been found that gibberellic acid enhances flowering, but merely so because leaves are formed more rapidly.  The number of leaves formed before flowering is hardly reduced by gibberellic acid and the latter therefore can not be considered as having substituted for the cold requirement. Also experiments on the effect of a growth-retardant ((2-chloroethyl) trimethylammonium; CCC) during vernalization are carried out.<p>

	A. D. McKELVIE:  Linkage studies with Arabidopsis.  A preliminary account of linkage in Arabidopsis has been published by McKELVIE (Arabidopsis Research, Gottingen, pp. 79-82, 1965) showing the degrees of linkage between a number of different genes.  In order to fit this into a general pattern of linkage for Arabidopsis, a comparison is being made between mutants induced by McKELVIE, by REDEI and by ROBBELEN.  The mutants of REDEI are:  an; as, gi2; pa (er); gl2; lu, co; vc2 (er).  Those of ROBBELEN are V 18, 19, 21/1, 21/2, 24/1, 24/3, 34/5, 25/1, 26, 28, 29, 32, 36, 37, 40, 42, 43, 44, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51.  The initial crosses are only being done at present but results will be announced as soon as possible.  It may be possible to incorporate mutants from other research workers and a few such mutants would be acceptable.  It will, however, be impossible to deal with a large number of new genes.

Growth of Arabidopsis thaliana on deuteriated media<p>

	A detailed study of biological effects of the stable isotope of hydrogen was started in our laboratory using race "Estland" or Arabidopsis.  The objectives are to gather information on the effects of partial or complete deuteriation of biologically important molecules on the development of plants, possible genetic effects of the resulting deuteriation of the hydrogen bonds in DNA and deuteriation effects on radiation sensitivity of seeds.<p>

	Surface sterilized dry seeds are planted aseptically on mineral media containing increasing amounts of deuterium oxide, 10, 30, 50, 70 and 90 percent heavy water and rest H20, solidified with 0.78 percent ion agar.  Plants are grown under continuous illumination in controlled environment chambers.  In the first experiment, there were no surviving plants at maturity in deuterium levels of over 10 percent.  Seeds obtained from survivors were grown on progressively increasing concentrations of heavy water, in subsequent generations.  Results indicate that Arabidopsis can be gradually adapted to grow on deuteriated media. So far, we have obtained seeds from plants grown on media containing 50 percent D20, and the experiment is being continued with increasing percentage of heavy water in the culture medium.<p>

	The results show that deuteriation delays and inhibits seed germination, retards growth, delays time to opening of the first flower, reduces plant height at flowering, increases the number of leaves, and reduces pollen and seed fertility.  Germination percentage of seeds obtained from plants grown on partially deuteriated media is lower than that of controls.  Plants grown on deuteriated media are lighter green in color and show lack of chlorophyll.  A limited anlaysis of the progeny of plants raised on partially deuteriated media did not show any chlorophyll or morphological mutations. Details will be published later.<p>

Dimethyl sulfoxide as a mutagen carrier<p>

	Recently there have been several reports that dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) enhance absorption through biological membranes, and it is being tested as a carrier for drugs in several laboratories (KLIGMAN, 1965).  We have observed similar rapid transport of dyes dissolved in DMSO through plant tissue.  Subsequently we started experiments to investigate whether this solvent can be used as a carrier for chemical mutagens in higher plants, employing Arabidopsis as the test material.  If feasible, mutagens dissolved in DMSO can thus be transported to the meristematic region more rapidly and treatment time will be considerably reduced.<p>

	The results show that 100 percent DMSO is toxic to Arabidopsis seeds and plants.  However, we have found that up to 30 percent DMSO applied as a single drop to the apical meristem is not lethal, though it retards growth slightly.  Ten percent DMSO did not show any appreciable retardation effect. We have used similar concentrations of IuDR, BuDR and FuDR dissolved in aqueous and 30 percent DMSO solutions.  The growth inhibition effect of FuDR dissolved in 30 percent DMSO was very marked. This could be due either to a synergistic effect of the two or to increased uptake of FuDR.  The mutagenic effect of these treatments and others with EMS is under investigation.<p>

Modification of leaf shape in Arabidopsis by phenyl boric adic<p>

	Treatment of Arabidopsis seedlings of race "Estland" and erecta type of race "Landsberg" at the cotyledonary leaf stage, with 300-600 ppm of phenyl boric acid (PBA), changes the shape of leaves subsequently formed.  Leaves that develop after the treatment are narrower and lanceolate with acute apices, in contrast to the broad leaves with round apices found in untreated controls. This effect is observed in all the treated plants.  However, the effect is more marked in erecta as the control leaves are rounder in this type. Except for the occurrence of lanceolate leaves, plants treated with this range of PBA concentrations are similar to controls in other morphological and physiological characters. At higher levels growth is retarded. The lanceolate shape induced by PBA is not inherited and the progeny of treated plants produce normal leaves.  These results confirm the findings of MATHAN (1965) in tomato where PBA simulates the effect of the lanceolate gene.  To our knowledge there is no record of a gene producing lanceolate leaves in Arabidopsis but there are several which modify the form of leaves (McKELVIE, 1962).<p>

Esterases of Arabidopsis thaliana<p>

	With the application of histochemical techniques to the proteins separated electrophoretically on polyacrylamide gels, it is possible to locate different molecular forms of specific enzymes on the zymograms.  Using this technique, we have observed the pattern shown in the Figure for esterases from the leaf extracts of race "Estland".  In total we obtain nine different bands showing esterase activity.  We have tentatively labeled these bands as Es 1 to Es 9.  This pattern will be used as standard for a survey of the genetic variation in esterases.<p>

Back volumes of Arabidopsis Information Service<p>

	The AIS No. 1 and 2 as well as the Suppl. Vol. 1:  "Arabidopsis Research" have been printed with 200 copies each.  Because of the unexpected high number of orders only a few copies of No. 1 are still available; the supply of No. 2 and the Suppl. Volume is entirely exhausted.  Photocopies of single (!) contributions from "Arabidopsis Research" will be provided at cost price by:  Niedersachsische Staats-und Universitatsbibliothek, 34 Gottingen, Germany, or by the Library of Congress, Washington (refer to E-49-113).<p>
