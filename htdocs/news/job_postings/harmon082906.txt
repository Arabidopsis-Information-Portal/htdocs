Subject:
[Arabidopsis] Postdoctoral position: regulation of soybean cysteine synthesis
From:
Alice Harmon <harmon@ufl.edu>

A postdoctoral position is open in the laboratory of Dr. Alice Harmon
located in the beautiful new Cancer and Genetics Research Complex at the
University of Florida in Gainesville. The successful candidate will begin
work no later than January 2, 2007. The position is for three years, and the
salary is $35,000 a year and includes health insurance.
 
The project will examine the role of GmSerat2;1 (Glycine max serine
acetyltransferase 2;1) in cysteine synthesis, sulfur metabolism, and stress
responses. This enzyme is one of four soybean serat genes, and it is
phosphorylated and regulated by calcium-dependent protein kinase (Fenglong
Liu, Byung-Chun Yoo, Jung-Youn Lee, Wei Pan, and Alice C. Harmon,
³Calcium-regulated phosphorylation of soybean serine acetyltransferase in
response to oxidative stress² J. Biol. Chem., Jul 2006;
doi:10.1074/jbc.M604548200, published online July 17).  Experience in DNA
cloning and protein techniques, including enzyme assays, protein
purification, and protein-protein interaction, is desirable.
 
To apply, please send a C.V. and contact information for three referees to
Alice Harmon at harmon@ufl.edu. Additional information is available via
email or by calling 352-273-8096.
