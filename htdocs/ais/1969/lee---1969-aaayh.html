Narrow-serrated (Ns) and Narrow-curved (Nc) trisomics were illustrated
by STEINITZ-SEARS in 1963.  They closely resemble each other in
morphology, except the former has a more serrated leaf margin and a
less curved petiole.  However, studies showed Ns was triplex for both
lu and tz, whereas Nc gave a positive result for tz but not lu.  This
would be expected if Nc is a secondary, tertiary or telosomic
trisomic.  Nc was found to be a telotrisomic by cytological
examination.  It is therefore established that tz and lu are on the
different arms of this chromosome.<p>
