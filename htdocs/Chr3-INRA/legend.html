The DNA probes and PCR markers used in this study are ordered along the base line.
All the markers indicated were tested on the CIC YAC library. The yUP library was
screened only with markers adjacent to gaps, in order to bridge the contigs, and
internal markers have not been tested systematically on these clones. The nature
of each marker is indicated below (&#212; : PCR marker ; * : hybridization probe ; + :
YAC end-probe (hybridization probe)). When available, the genetic position (in cM)
of markers on the <A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk:8300/Vol4i/">Recombinant Inbred
Lines (RI) map</A> (Lister and Dean, 1997) is indicated. Markers designated &quot;RI&quot;
have been mapped on the RI lines (unpublished results from our laboratories) and
all apart from AthLecRK were found to be in the correct position relative to flanking
markers. Markers designated &quot;atgc&quot; are located on the <A HREF="http://cbil.humgen.upenn.edu/~atgc/ATGCUP.html">ATGC
RI genetic map</A>. When linkage information is available, although not on the RI
map, &quot;CAPS&quot; is noted for <A HREF="/aboutcaps.html">CAPS
markers</A> and &quot;class&quot; or &quot;int&quot; is noted for markers present
respectively on the <A HREF="http://mutant.lse.okstate.edu/genepage/genepage.html">classical</A>
or the <A HREF="/aboutgenmaps.html">integrated
map</A> (Hauge<I> et al.</I>, 1993).<BR>
Solid lines drawn under the markers indicate that the actual order of the markers
underlined cannot be determined either from the genetic or physical data. Boxes indicate
local inconsistency between the genetic position on the RI map and the position on
the YAC map. The extent of each of the 9 contigs is indicated by black solid bars
above the markers. An estimated size of each contig is also given (calculated as
the total size of the YAC clones for the contig, divided by the mean redundancy observed).
Gaps are indicated in grey. The gap between contigs 8.1 and 8.2 (hatched) was filled
using the <A HREF="http://194.94.225.1/private_workgroups/pg_101/bac.html">IGF BAC
library</A> (look <A HREF="link.html">here</A> for details). The gap between contigs
8 and 9 has also been filled using BAC clones (<A HREF="mailto:salanou@genoscope.cns.fr">M.
Salanoubat</A>, personal communication). The location of the centromere is indicated
between contigs 7 and 8. The actual physical sizes of the gaps are unknown, and difficult
to estimate from genetic data. The ordered YAC clones are tabulated above the contig
line. For each clone, the name is indicated on the left -a &quot;*&quot; indicates
that the clone is chimeric-, and the size in kb, as determined by PFGE analysis,
on the right (CIC clones : <A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk:8300/Vol2ii/CIC_YACs/CIC_YAC_Table.intro.html">Creusot
<I>et al</I>., 1995</A> ; yUP clones : <A HREF="http://cbil.humgen.upenn.edu/~atgc/physical-mapping/yUPsize.html">ATGC
web site</A>) . Note that sometimes more than one size is indicated, which means
that some yeast clones may contain several YACs, or may actually be a mixture of
clones. The size of the lines only reflects the number of markers on a given clone,
and by no means gives any indication on the physical size of the clones. Hits with
YAC end probes (69) are indicated in dark grey, and other markers in light grey;
repetitive DNA probes are hatched. A &quot;-&quot; sign indicates tested markers
that are negative on a particular clone, an indication of an internal deletion, and
&quot;nt&quot; indicates that the marker was not tested on a particular YAC.<BR>
