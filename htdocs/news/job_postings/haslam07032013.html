<p>Post-Doctoral Research Scientist</p>
<p>Rothamsted Research, the UK&#39;s oldest and largest agricultural
    research centre, is seeking a Post-Doctoral Research Scientist as part of
    Rothamsted Research&#39;s Designing Seeds for Nutrition and Health research
    programme which aims to utilise our expertise in seed biology and
    biochemistry to deliver improved health and nutrition through seeds.</p>
<p>The successful applicant will join a well-established oilseed improvement
    programme, with a specific focus on the role of the lipidome in extreme
    environments. The contribution to the lipidome (total cellular lipid pool)
    makes in determining the ability to tolerate suboptimal conditions will be
    examined at the transcript and metabolite level. The successful candidate
    will be expected to contribute to the following main research areas:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The application of state of the art analytical techniques to
        identify the key lipids responsible for tolerance of extreme
        environments and their mechanisms of action</li>
    <li>Tissue-specific transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) during seed
        maturation</li>
    <li>Manipulation of plants using targeted molecular methods </li>
</ul>
<p>To fill this exciting and challenging role, we are seeking a highly
    motivated researcher with a proven track record in plant molecular biology
    and metabolite analysis. Experience of lipid extraction and/or RNA-Seq would
    be a distinct advantage.</p>
<p>As a member of a multidisciplinary group, the ability to work as part of
    a team and excellent communication skills are essential.</p>
