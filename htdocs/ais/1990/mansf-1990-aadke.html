SUMMARY<p>

The coenocytic endosperm begins to cellularize adjacent to the embryo
at the time of cotyledon initiation 60 HAF, but the chalazal region
cellularizes considerably later - 96 to 120 HAF. This process occurs
by means of freely growing cell walls and formation from embryosac
wall projections. Associated with the growing tips are dictyosomes,
ER, mitochondria, microtubulus and numerous orderly aranged vesicles.<p>

INTRODUCTION<p>

Apart from the classically assigned function of nourishing the embryo
(BRINK and COOPER, 1947; MAHESHWARI, 1950), the endosperm (coenocytic
and cellular) in most angiosperms provides a framework to support the
embryo and allows the system to become compartmentalized for storage
of reserves.<p>

However, despite its frequently stated importance, very little is
known about the process of endosperm cellularization: either its
structure, mode or pattern of development. Certainly, there has been
no report on any cruciferous species, although a few noteworthy
studies have been published for other groups, including Helianthus
annus and Stellaria media (NEWCOMB and FOWKE, 1973), Quercus gambelli
(SINGH and MOGENSEN, 1976), and Haemanthus katherinae (NEWCOMB, 1978).<p>

This report describes the anatomical and ultrastructural changes in
the endosperm of Arabidopsis thaliana during the transition from a
coenocytic to a cellular condition. Stages of endosperm development
are based on the defined time scale after flowering (HAF) using the
visual definition of flowering previously defined by MUELLER (1961).
MATERIALS AND METHODS<p>

Plants were grown and tissues processed for light and electron
microscopy as described in the preceding report (MANSFIELD and
BRIARTY, 1990).<p>

RESULTS<p>

Micropylar chamber.<p>

The endosperm remains in a free-nuclear state for approximately 60
HAF. It then begins to cellularize very rapidly, this being almost
complete by 72 HAF, although it continues up to 120 HAF. Cell wall
formation begins at cotyledon initiation during the early-heart stage
of embryogenesis. The walls are initiated at the adges of the
micropylar region of the embryosac, growing centripetally towards the
embryo and extending peripherally in the direction of the chalazal
chamber (Figure 1) over a period of approximately 24 h. Endosperm in
the chalazal region remains free-nuclear at 96 HAF (Figure 2). The
pattern of cellularization in the embryosac is summarized in Figure 3.<p>

Just prior to cellularization and during cell wall formation the
endosperm cytoplasm is highly vacuolate (Figure 4) and contains large
amounts of dilated ER, free ribosomes and active dictyosomes. The
latter tend to concentrate adjacent to the embryosac wall and to a
lesser extent in other peripheral regions of the cell.<p>

Bar numbers are in *micro*m.  CW = cell wall, D = dictyosome, ER =
endoplasmic reticulum, M = mitochondrion, Pl = plastid, V = vacuole,
WP = wall projections.  A network of highly convoluted cell walls
develop in the cytoplasm adjacent to the embryosac wall and eventually
walls begin to form in sheets of cytoplasm extending from the main
mass of endosperm cytoplasm. This represents the growing end of the
wall (Figure 1). The tips of the freely growing walls are often
thickened and sometimes appear bulb-shaped or hooked (Figures 5 and
6), and associated with these structures are masses of orderly
arranged vesicles and microtubules, dictyosomes, dilated ER and
mitochondria. Further from the tip (towards the embryosac wall) a
normal continuous wall containing plasmodesmata is present (Figure 5).<p>

The freely growing endosperm cell walls continue to grow anticlinally
and periclinally. Adjacent wall tips are often observed in close
proximity (Figure 1) but these are not observed fusing to form a cell.
Cells may be formed by branching of the growing point. In Figure 6 the
two arrays of vesicles extending from the main tip may represent the
early stages of branch formation. Eventually several layers of cells
are formed, producing a network of highly vacuolate endosperm cells
extending throughout the embryo-sac.<p>

Chalazal chamber<p>

The free-nuclear endosperm in the chalazal chamber is last to
cellularize (Figure 3); this happens between 96 and 120 HAF. This
tissue appears to develop independently of the endosperm elsewhere and
even when the micropylar endosperm has cellularized directly adjacent
to the chalazal tissue, the change of state is not immediate.<p>

Just prior to and during cellularization, the tissue is highly
vacuolate and contains numerous plastids and mitochondria. Masses of
ER and dictyosomes are ubiquitous (Figure 7). The crystal-like
inclusions observed during earlier development of the chalazal
endosperm (see Figure 15 of preceding report, MANSFIELD and BRIARTY,
1990) are also present at stage 108 HAF (not shown).<p>

During cellularization wall projections at the chalazal base provide a
template for the growth of cell walls through the chalazal tissue
(Figure 8). As growth proceeds many nodule-like structures form on the
main walls (Figure 9) and numerous plasmodesmata are present in all
regions. The endosperm is fully cellular by 120 HAF and all layers of
micropylar endosperm are fused forming a continuous network with the
cellularized chalazal endosperm. The adjacent tissue masses share a
common cell wall, although their cytoplasm remains structurally
distinguishable. The network of walls formed through the chalazal
tissue displays no orderly pattern unlike certain regions of the
micropylar endosperm.<p>

DISCUSSION<p>

Cellularization in Arabidopsis occurs by means of freely-growing cell
walls and formation from wall projections. These two processes,
together with protoplast-like wall formation and mitotic plate
formation and mitotic plate formation in cellular endosperm have been
observed in the endosperm of Stellaria media (NEWCOMB and FOWKE,
1973). Many features of wall formation observed in Arabidopsis are
similar to those described for other species, including Stellaria,
Haemanthus (NEWCOMB, 1978) and Quercus gambelli (SINGH and MOGENSEN,
1976). For example, in all of these species the tips of the growing
endosperm cell walls are often bulb-shaped and appear thicker than the
remainder of the wall, and the association of microtubules and
vesicles (presumably of Golgi origin), rough ER and dictyosomes has
been described for Stellaria and Haemanthus. Furthermore, microtubules
have been consistently observed in wheat endosperm by many workers
(EVERS, 1970; MARES et al., 1975, 1977; MORRISON and O'BRIEN, 1976).
Although mitotic cell division was not observed in Arabidopsis, the
presence of microtubules and the orderly arrangement of cell walls
perpendicular to the direction of centripetal wall growth, suggests
the involvement of cross-wall formation in the generation of
successive cell layers.<p>

The initiation of endosperm wall formation poses a number of
interesting questions. Is the embryo involved directly, acting as a
source of growth substances?  Is growth promoted solely by hormones
transported into the seeds? To what extent does the enlarging embryo
govern endosperm state? The light microscopical observations
demonstrate that the transition of endosperm from a free-nuclear to a
cellular state coincides with cotyledon initiation and that walls form
first in the micropylar region. This is also the case in Stellaria
media (PRITCHARD, 1964). The embryo may secrete hormones or other
growth-controlling substances, that trigger wall formation in nearby
regions, and this would explain the early cellularization of the
micropylar endosperm associated with the embryo. A likely component of
the embryo cells is the rapidly differentiating plastidome, although
it is possible that the micropylar chamber is a sink for the flow of
growth hormones and nutrients into the embryosac. Alternatively, the
effect of increased mechanical pressure on the endosperm exerted by
the expanding embryo, may be an important controlling factor (cf the
thigmotropic response of plants).<p>

The developmental significance of the endosperm and its relationship
with the embryo is extremely complicated and probably involves an
interaction of many factors. Attempts so far to elucidate these
relationships are clearly limited by our ignorance of the biochemical
aspects involved.<p>
