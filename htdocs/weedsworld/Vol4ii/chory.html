New receptors and circadian cycling dominated the talks in the session
on light-regulated development. The cloning of two new putative receptors
was announced. Joanne Chory (Salk Institute) spoke about the cloning of
the <I>BRI1</I> gene, which encodes a putative leucine-rich repeat receptor
kinase involved in brassinosteroid signal transduction. While direct binding
of brassinosteroids to this putative receptor has not been shown yet, the
cloning of the receptor opens the way for studying the complex interactions
between light and hormone signalling which were also touched upon during
this talk.

<P>Eva Huala (The Carnegie Institute) described the cloning of the putative
receptor for phototropism encoded by the <I>NPH1</I> gene. This gene encodes
a protein that is predicted to be a serine/threonine protein kinase which
also contains a putative redox-sensing regulatory domain. Protein kinase
activity for the phototropism photoreceptor was predicted earlier from
biochemical experiments, and, as such, the identification of the <I>NPH1</I>
gene as a protein kinase is satisfying. The <I>NPH1</I> gene represents
another new class of regulatory photoreceptor used by higher plants.

<P>Steve Kay (Scripps Institute) gave an overview of the interactions between
phototransduction pathways and the circadian clock in controlling plant
growth and development. Studies from his lab using <I>cab-luciferase</I>
transgenic lines crossed into various photoreceptor mutant backgrounds
underscored the importance of studying complex signalling networks in real
time. Kay showed elegantly the precise contribution of individual photoreceptors
and signalling components to light and clock-regulated responses in <I>Arabidopsis</I>.
Kay's talk nicely set the stage for two talks identifying a new class of
myb-type transcription factors that play a role in light- and clock-regulated
gene expression. George Coupland (John Innes Centre) reported on the identification
and cloning of one of these genes, <I>LHY</I>. Overexpression of LHY causes
late-flowering, a long hypocotyl, and leaf movements and circadian regulated
gene expression to become arrhythmic. Likewise, Zhi-Yong Wang (UCLA) reported
new studies on the <I>Arabidopsis</I> <I>CCA1</I> gene. CCA1 was identified
as an activator of CAB gene transcription in response to phytochrome action.
As with LHY<I>, </I>overexpression of CCA1 causes increased hypocotyl length
and substantially delayed flowering, and CAB gene expression and leaf movements
to become arrhythmic. Thus, this new class of transcription factors, currently
represented by CCA1 and LHY, may prove to be key regulators in the phototransduction
and circadian clock transduction pathways.

<P>&nbsp;The session was closed by Keiko Torii (Yale) who discussed the
functional dissection of the COP1 protein which has been proposed to be
a negative regulator in the light signalling pathways. Her studies showed
that the 3 predicted domains of COP1-a ring finger, WD40 repeats, and a
coiled-coil domain-were all essential for COP1 activity. Future biochemical
studies with COP1 should help to elucidate the mechanism by which it represses
photomorphogenetic development.</BLOCKQUOTE>
