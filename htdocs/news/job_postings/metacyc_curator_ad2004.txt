Metabolic pathway curator position available March 1, 2004

We are seeking applicants for a full-time position of a curator to
annotate metabolic pathways of plants, with an emphasis on secondary
metabolism. This project is a collaboration between Carnegie
Institution and SRI International, in which plant metabolic pathways
are being curated into MetaCyc, a comprehensive, experimentally
verified metabolic pathway database (http://www.metacyc.org/) and
AraCyc, an Arabidopsis-specific metabolic pathway database
(http://www.arabidopsis.org/aracyc/).

The curator will be responsible for:

1. researching new plant metabolic pathways, enzymes, and transporters
in the scientific literature, and to evaluate, organize, and add that
information to the MetaCyc and AraCyc databases.

2. contributing to the development of standard operation procedures on
annotation methods and to the general development of MetaCyc and
AraCyc such as adding new data types, data integration, and web page
enhancement.

3. communicating with researchers at meetings or via email to improve
the quality of the data, train researchers in using the tools at
MetaCyc and AraCyc, and supporting user questions.

The successful candidate will work with a team of curators, software
engineers, and database developers. Successful candidates will have a
Ph.D. degree or equivalent in biochemistry, a demonstrated ability for
independent, critical thinking and excellent communication and
teamwork skills.

Qualified candidates should email a resume to Peifen Zhang at:
