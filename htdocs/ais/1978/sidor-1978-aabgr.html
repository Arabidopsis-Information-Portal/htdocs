Arabidopsis thaliana has been claimed to be a suitable plant for
somatic cell genetics, but attempts to use Arabidopsis protoplasts for
such experiments so far met with limited success (Negrutiu et al.,
1975; Abstr. 2nd Intrn. Symp. Arabid. Res. 1976; Avetisov, 1976).
Therefore we have been attempting to develop appropriate conditions
for isolation of Arabidopsis protoplats from callus tissues and for
their subsequent culture and fusion (Gleba, et al., 1978). The purpose
of the present study is the analysis of the fine-structural changes
occurring during isolation and culture of Arabidopsis protoplasts from
callus tissues as well as in the time of induced fusion with tobacco
mesophyll protoplasts.<p>

Material and Methods<p>

Callus tissues of two races (Enkheim and Dijon) of Arabidopsis
thaliana (L.) Heynh. were initiated and grown on a solid &#158;5 medium
(Gamborg et al., 1968) in darkness at 26*degrees*C. Log-phase callus
tissues (10-14 days after transplantation on to fresh medium) of 4-9
passages were used for protoplast isolation. Tobacco plants (Nicotiana
tabacum, var. Dubeck 44) wer3 grown under greenhouse conditions.
Isolation and culture of protoplasts as well as potoplast fusion were
performed as described previously (Gleba et al. 1978)<p>

Preparation for electron microscopy was based on Fowkes (1975)
techniques. Protoplasts were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde for 3-4 hours
at a room t*degrees*. The glutaraldehyde was prepared in protoplast
culture medium containing 0.3 M mannitol. The material was rinsed
in cooled 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, and postfixed in 1% OsO4 in
the same buffer for 15-17 hours at )*Degrees*C. After washing in
cooled distilled water (2 times for 3-5 minutes at 0 (*degrees*C), the
protoplasts were slowly dehydrated in ethanol (O*degrees*C),
transferred to propylene oxide and infiltrated with Epon-or Araldite.
They were ethen flat embedded in a thin layer of pure resin in glass
Petri dishes previously coated with a "Release agent MS-122"
(Miller-Stephenson Chemical Co., Ltd., USA), or in flat molds with
thin organic film bottom. The material was stained with uranyl acetate
at the last stages of dehydration (Locke et al., 1971). Sections were
cut with an LKB III ultrotome, mounted on coated grids, stained with
lead citrate and examined in a JEM-100B electron microscope.<p>

Results<p>

The enzyme mixture used in this study makes it possible to obtain
about 2-4 x 10 7 protoplasts from 1 g of callus tissue in 16-18 hours
at 25*degrees*C. Cell contamination in the filtered protoplast
suspensions was, as a rule, less than 0.1%. Electron microscopic
observations of ultrathin sections shows that isolated protoplasts are
bounded by unit plasma membrane only, have spherical or slightly oval
shape, and preserve, in general, the ultrastructural organization of
source callus cells. A typical Arabidopsis protoplast is shown on
Figure 1. Protoplast population is to a considerable extent
morphologically hetrogeneous. Some protoplasts have a highly developed
vacuum, others contain large leucoplasts with starch grains, the
cytoplasm of some reveals a large quantity of lipid globules.
Protoplasts vary markedly in size - from about 10 to 50 micro m in
diameter. Their nuclei usually have irregular form, they are often
multilobed and are characterized by a dispersed chromatin. Some
protoplasts are multinucleate (Figure 2). The surfaces of some freshly
isolated protoplasts show a large quantity of small electron-dense
globular projections of a greatly variable size, some having a size of
cytoplasmic lipid globules (Figure 3).<p>

First divisions of Arabidopsis callus protoplasts in modified B5
medium were observed on the second day of culture (Figure 4). Plating
efficiences typically ranged from 30% to 80% (counting on the fifth
day). The percentage of budding protoplasts in the culture was
negligible. After 3-5 days of culture, second and subsequent divisions
occurred and primary cell colonies were formed (Figure 5). During this
period, Arabidopsis protoplasts are characterized by considerable
increase in quantity of the main cell organelles. Thus, accumulations
of extensively developed rough ER cisternae were often noticed in
different areas of cytoplasm (Figure 6). Tangential sections of
protoplast surfaces at this time reveal also weakly stainable
cellulose containing layer with incorporated surface projections of
electron dense substance. Most of the last undergo lysis resulting in
various figures (Figures 7, 8). Cross sections show that the same
lysing projections may be under the newly formed loose cell wall layer
(Figure 9). Tangential sections depicted also large accumulations of
microtubules, situated in a variable orientation. On the other hand,
we also found long bundles of uniformly directed microtubules (Figure
8).<p>

Agglutination of plasma membranes and subsequent fusion of Arabidopsis
callus and tobacco mesophyll protoplasts were observed immediately
after PEG dilution (Figure 10). Numerous tobacco + Arabidopsis fusion
products were seen two hours after PEG treatment. By this time, mixing
of different cytoplasms did not yet occur, and small vacuoles of
different sizes were seen on the boundaries between alien cytoplasms
(Figure 11). Tobacco and Arabidopsis nuclei may be seen on the
different poles of the fusion products (Figures 12, 13). 5-6 hours
after PEG removal, specific organelles in the fusion products were
considerably mixed suggesting cytoplasm mixing. Arabidopsis
leucoplasts and tobacco chloroplasts served as specific marker
organelles in these studies. No changes in the fine structure of
subcellular components were noticed. While studying large numbers of
serial sections of these fusion products (Figures 14, 15), we
routinely found only one nucleus per cell.<p>

DISCUSSION<p>

The ultrastructural study showed the effectiveness of the methods
used. The Arabidopsis protoplast suspension consists mainly of intact
single protoplasts with larger multinucleate protoplasts among them.
These multinucleate protoplasts obviously arise as a result of
spontaneous fusion during enzyme treatment of cells (Withers, Cocking,
1972; Fowke et al., 1975; etc). Using electron microscopic analysis of
the dividing cells from protoplasts and of the cell colonies
formation, we did not reveal "embryoid-like" anomalies which have been
observed in cultured protoplasts of other species earlier (Prat,
Poirier-Hamon, 1975; Sidorov et al., 1977). Detailed investigation
revealed spherical projections on the surface of some freshly isolated
protoplasts. Those surface projections are well stained with OsO4 and
are similar to lipid globules. Similar formations have been seen
during scanning the surface of freshly isolated and cultured
protoplasts of different plants (Burgess, Linstead, 1976). Whether
particles in question are evolved from phospholipid-rich plasma
membrane or any other cytoplasmic structures remains unclear. The
formation of such lipid-like structures appears to be a physiological
result of isolation procedure as well as of reparation processes.
Intensive lysis of surface projections in time of protoplast culture
seems to represent itself the process of lipolysis, and characterize
protoplasm plasma membrane as one of the components of lysosome plant
cell system, what was claimed by workers (N.V. Belitser, pers. comm.).
Peroxidases localized on plasma membrane of isolated tobacco
protoplasts in our previous study (Belitser et al., 1977) may be
supposed to take a part in lipolysis process seemingly by means of the
mechanism of lipid peroxidation (Goldfischer et al., 1971; Blac,
Bogart, 1973). The process of lipolysis was observed also earlier
(Gigot et al., 1975; Belitser et al., 1977) and may indicate the
possibility of using lipid as a rich energy source during protoplast
regeneration.<p>

Microtubules found adjacent to plasmalemma in freshly isolated
protoplasts appear to be wall microtubules which preserved after
enzymatic digestion of cell wall. According to present views, cortical
microtubules perform cytoskeletal function or take part in the
orientation of synthesizing cellulose microfibrils. Recent workers
(for example, Heath, 1974; Willison, 1975; Schnepf et al., 1975;
Robinson et al., 1976) disagree concerning the role played by cortical
microtubules in cellulose microfibril orientation. Considerable
accumulation of cortical tubules in the time of protoplast culture is,
obviously, a result of formation them de novo, and connected with cell
wall regeneration. It seems therefore reasonable that microtubules are
necessary for normal wall regeneration.<p>

Ultrastructural study of agglutination and of the first stages of
protoplast fusion under treatment with PEG did not show any
distinctions as compared with previously observed data (Fowke et al.,
1975). At the early stages of culture, we did not show any indications
for cytoplasmic incompatibility in fusion products. Although nuclear
fusion according to literary data may occur pior to (Constabel et al.,
1975; Fowke et al., 1976), as well as during mitosis (KAO et al.,
1974), our results make it possible to assume, that formation of true
Arabidopsis + tobacco hybrid cells may occur prior mitosis (possibly,
after 5-6 hours of culture). Detailed fine-structural study of the
fate of Arabidopsis + tobacco fusion products is hampered considerably
because of difficulty in preliminary identification of hybrid cells
under light microscope. Induction of divisions in Arabidopsis +
tobacco fusion products and study of submicroscopic changes occurring
in these reconstituted cell systems are the purposes of further
experiments.<p>
