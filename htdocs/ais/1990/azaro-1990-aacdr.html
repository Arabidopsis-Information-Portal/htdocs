For the estimation of the vital power and fertility of the pollen it
is necessary to have information about the morphology and behaviour of
sperms and vegetative nucleus in germinated pollen grains at various
stages of their development, particularly after preliminary action on
the pollen by mutagenic or stress factor.<p>

The communiaction presents a method to produce constant stained
preparations of Arabidopsis pollen tubes germinated in vitro.
Gallcyanochrome alum was used for staining nuclei in the pollen tubes
(EINARSON, 1951). The pollen of Arabidopsis thaliana (Enkheim race)
was germinated on the microscopic slide by means of agar nutrient
medium (AZAROV et al., 1989).<p>

Constant preparations with properly stained pollen tubes are obtained
by means of their fixation, washing in alcohol, water, maceration etc.
During these procedures the germinated pollen grains are washed out of
the agar layer surface, and after the maceration the agar detaches off
the slide too. To avoid this, the agar plate with the germinated
pollen is covered with a thin layer of fresh protein of hen's egg. The
protein is applied on the agar plate surface, using a thin glass
stick, by quick spiral-type motions from the edges towards the center.
The protein layer should become very thin and uniform. In some 15 to
20 seconds, immediately after drying the protein layer, the
preparation is placed for 5 minutes in Carnoy mixture (ethanol,
chloroform, acetic acid; 6:3:1, p/p/p). Further on, staining of the
preparations is carried out according to the method described earlier
(PETROV et al., 1984).<p>

When producing the preparations, overdrying of the protein should be
avoided otherwise it may cause mechanical damage of the pollen tubes.
Special attention should also be paid to the quality of the protein:
during the fixation the old protein becomes turbid and this makes it
impossible to watch the sperms and the vegetative nucleus after
staining. The agar and protein layers should be very thin otherwise it
would be impossible to study them by the immersion method.<p>

and vegetative nucleus.<p>

Using these procedures we have succeeded in obtaining constant
preparations which clearly demonstrate sperms stained dark violet and
vegetative nuclei stained light violet (Figure 1). In some cases it is
possible to examine details of their structure. Cytoplasm in the tubes
is not stained.<p>
