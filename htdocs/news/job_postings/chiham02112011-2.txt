MARS Molecular Biology Postdoctoral Fellowship to identify 
Self-incompatibility genes in Theobroma cacao 

We offer a 2 year position in a professional and highly-motivating working 
environment in a well-equipped lab at USDA-ARS Subtropical Horticulture 
Research Station (SHRS) in Miami, FL in collaboration with UC Davis. 
The postdoctoral position is for a highly skilled scientist in molecular 
biology making original contributions to a diverse set of scientific 
projects. The incumbent's main research topic will be the characterization 
of self- incompatibility in Theobroma cacao. The incumbent will characterize 
gamete fusion and early zygote development through cytological and gene 
expression studies in self compatible and self-incompatible genotypes. In 
collaboration with other scientists at the University of Nebraska, the 
incumbent will also work in the cytological and molecular characterization 
of cacao seeds through their development. Extensive transcriptome and 
phenotypic data are already available for this project. These studies aim to 
identify gene function regulating traits of important agronomic and 
organoleptic quality value and to establish the foundations for a Marker 
Assisted Selection platform. 



Desired Qualifications

Demonstrated experience with reproductive biology and in situ hybridization 
methods.. 

Interested candidates should contact both: Dr. A. Bennett (
