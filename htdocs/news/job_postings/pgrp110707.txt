Plant Biology Internships at Cornell University

The Plant Genome Research Program (PGRP) at Cornell University and Boyce 
Thompson Institute is sponsoring undergraduate summer internships in Ithaca, New 
York.  Internships are 8-10 weeks in length in one of the participating labs 
currently doing plant genome research.  Interns will be mentored by a graduate 
student or post-doctoral associate and will work with their mentors on a project 
related to plant genomics.  They will learn the latest in molecular biology 
techniques, and depending on the lab, may also participate in fieldwork.  All 
students will be attending lab meetings, reading and discussing recent 
literature related to their project, and will present their research to the 
other students, principal investigators, and mentors at our summer student 
symposium.
Requirements:
Students must be either US citizens or permanent US residents (green card 
holder). Applicants must be enrolled in a college/university for Fall 2008. 
Applicants must be one of the following: high school seniors attending college 
in the Fall 2008, college freshman, college sophomore, college junior, or a non-
graduating college senior.
For participation in the program, student interns will be provided a stipend, 
housing, and some travel expenses.
