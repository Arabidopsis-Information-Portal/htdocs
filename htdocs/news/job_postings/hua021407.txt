A postdoctoral position is available in the Department of Plant Biology at
Cornell University to study molecular genetics of temperature response under
non-extreme conditions and its interplay with defense response in
Arabidopsis. Applicants should have a Ph D with strong background in
molecular biology, genetics, and plant physiology (or plant pathology). The
successful applicant will genetically dissect temperature responses using
molecular markers and/or temperature-dependent defense response mutants and
will characterize key players molecularly and biochemically. Applicant
should send a letter of intent, a research statement, a CV and contact
information of three references to Dr. Jian Hua, Department of Plant
Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853 or jh299@cornell.edu.
