Variants insensitive to amino-acid analogues and amino-acids were
among the first phenotypes to be selected for in plant cell cultures.
Insensitivity to the tryptophan analogues 5-methyltryptophan (5MT) and
6-fluorotryptophan has been reported for variants selected in cell
cultures of Nicotiana, Daucus, Solanum, Datura (e.g., Ranch, et al.,
1983), Petunia (Colijn et al., 1979) and Arabidopsis (Negrutiu et al.,
1978).<p>

It was shown by Cattoir-Reynaerts et al. (1981) and Van Ghelue et al.
(1982), that the isolation of amino-acid insensitive mutants in
Arabidopsis just as in barley does not require a cell-culture system.<p>

This short communication describes the isolation of a mutant more
insensitive than wildtype to 5MT by selection at the seedling stage.
To our knowledge this type of mutant has been isolated previously only
by selection at the cell-level.<p>

Mutant selection was performed among M 2 progeny of EMS treated
Landsberg "erecta" seeds. The same M 2 seeds had previously been
screened for several other types of mutants (Koornneef et al., 1982).
M 2 seeds were each bulked per 100 individually harvested M 1 plants.
35 of such seedlots were sown in a 9 cm petri dish (+/-1000
seeds/dish) containing 300 micro M 5-methyltryptophan (5MT) in the
standard mineral medium.<p>

The few plants which grew reasonably well on this medium were
transplanted into soil and their progeny was retested at 100 and 300
micro M 5MT. Insensitivity to 5MT was assayed by determining fresh
weight of 11 dy old seedlings growing in petri dishes with 5MT added
to the standard medium at a range of concentrations.<p>

Insensitivity of callus was assayed by the fresh weight of calli
developed from seeds on the PG5 medium (Scholten, pers. commun.)
containing 1 mgl -1 2, 4D and 0.2 mgl -1 kinetin together with 5MT, 7
weeks after sowing.<p>

Among M 2 seeds derived from 3500 M 1 plants one plant 9V IV) was
found which differed clearly from wildtype in its insensitivity to 5MT
after retesting of its progeny (Figure 1).<p>

This trait is also expressed at the callus level (Figure 2). 5MT
insensitivity behaves as a dominant trait at the seedling stage (data
not shown) and also at callus level (Table 1). The latter fact makes
this mutant useful as a partner in protoplast fusions when a dominant
resistance marker is desired. The plant phenotype of V IV is
completely comparable to wildtype. Further biochemical analyses will
be required to characterize the mutant. These will include measurement
of tryptophan levels, auxin autotrophy in tissue culture and
amino-acid uptake.<p>
