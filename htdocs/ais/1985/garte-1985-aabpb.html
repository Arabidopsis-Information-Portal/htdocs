This short communication is a continuation to the report of Kranz and
Bork (1984). During the last year we started the individual evaluation
for Arabidopsis seeds (genotype En-2) which were more or less hit by
cosmic HZE-particles during the SL 1-mission in Biostack units A2-F
and B2-F.<p>

Further information for the Arabidopsis material (genotype data etc.)
used, are reported in Schott, Reitz and Kranz (1983). The evaluation
of single HZE-tracks was made with the computerized system for
microdosimetric measurements described by Bork and Kranz (1983). The
seeds measured were cultivated under the same conditions as
Arabidopsis seeds evaluated in accelerator experiments (Koller-Lampert
and Kranz, 1983). The seeds evaluated were called M 1-individuals as
usual and the following generation of single lines were called M 2.
The growing M 1-plants were observed for the biological parameters
given in Kranz and Bork (1984) except for the REM microlesion
investigation and the chromosome aberration test. The parameters
germination rate and germination time after vernalization were
observed twice a day. The parameter length of seedling's root was
measured with a stereomagnifier, except for the data in the column for
Ne 19 MeV/n which were obtained by using the Leitz Orthoplan
microscope measuring system described by Bork and Kranz (1983). For
obtaining the parameters of embryo sterility, the third and fourth pod
were used to obtain the number of undeveloped embryos.<p>

micro m showing insufficient root hair formation, tumorous
terminal-subterminal, early fromation of adventitious roots. (See also
front cover photo of this AIS volume).<p>

Each single M 2-line consists of 100 seeds which were harvested from
one M 1-plant. Only a small number of M 2-lines didn't consist of 100
seeds. In these cases we didn't use less than 25 seeds. Totally, we
get results of 143 single M 2-lines. The M 2 plants were observed for
colour- and shape aberrations including tumorous and necrotic plants.
Each mutation was counted single, e.g., a yellow dwarf plant was
counted as a double mutation. Mutation frequency m c and rate R were
calculated as previously described (Kranz and Bork, 1984). Segregating
M 2-families were those consisting of >5 mutant plants.<p>

Altogether 250 single M 1-seeds were measured and evaluated in
relation to their impact parameters. The results of single data given
by computer graphs, show large deviations for the putative correlation
between impact parameter and biological damage of stacked Arabidopsis
seeds.<p>

As an explanation for the large standard deviation we found three main
reasons:<p>

- the straining HZE-radiation is inhomogen (further experiments with
an improved micropositioning system are planned to describe the
inhomogeniety by LET),<p>

- the plastic detectors used for HZE-particles only show particles
Z>2, the strain of protones is not indicated and thus evaluated (an
example for tumorous damage assumed to be caused by a proton is shown
in Figure 1a),<p>

- HZE-tracks occurring direct under seeds cannot be seen and were
therefore not measured. (For the future an evaluation method is
prepared which provides such data).<p>

Therefore, the amount of M 1-plants and single M 2-lines was divided
in two main sections (Table 1). The first section consists of plants
which had a small impact parameter to their seeds. In this case the
HZE particle had flown in a maximum range of 204 micro m to the centre
of the seed. For M 2-lines we choose the shoot meristem as relation
point for the impact parameter, and divided the total sample in three
equal parts. The other M 1-section was made of seeds with an impact
parameter between 674 and 1882 micro m to the seed centre. As
definition of limits the germination rate should be equal to 25 seeds
for close and remote impact parameter classes. For comparison, we
proved data of backup-control units (BF/BH), a ground control which
was unstacked, and two samples of accelerator experiments with Ne-and
Xe-ions which showed the same sterility of pods (Bork and Kranz,
1985). In the first column of Table 1, germination rate of the backup
controls BF/BH are very low. A similar effect was shown by Kranz and
Bork (1984). For explanation, an insufficient stack preparation was
suggested; additionally, it is possible that for BF/BH units, seeds of
an inferior quality were used. The variation of the other germination
rates were in the inconspicuous range of 70 to 100%. Evidently, there
is a reduction of germination in flown seeds in comparison to ground
control and the accelerator experiments which seems to be stongest
with seeds of shortest impact parameter.<p>

Table 1: M 1 results of biotest.<p>

For the germination time, a clear difference between the samples
prepared for the SL-1 mission, the ground control and accelerator
experiment samples occurs. The explanation to this phenomenon is hard
to define, because several reasons seem to be possible. For the
stacked samples a harmful influence of plastic material degassing
inside the stacks has to be taken in account. Control experiments
indicate the importance of this fact. A difference expected in the
germination time of seeds with close and remote impact parameters is
eventually concealed by these influences.<p>

For M 1-seeds the average length of the seedling's root is nearly the
same as for the ground control sample, which is surprising because it
is reasonable to expect a decrease in root length according to the
results of accelerator experiments (Bork and Kranz, 1985). An
important difference to the ground control is the increased standard
deviation. Reasons for this large deviation may be an influence of
inhomogenous radiation and/or insufficient stacking methods, as
mentioned above, because in Bh/BF samples this increase occurs too.
Furthermore, it is necessary to mention that in our experiments the
seedlings grown on agar medium show after certain time a pronounced
lengthening of the root caused by a time depending loss of agar
humidity. To exclude this influence as far as possible, we set a limit
of 150 hours for germination time in the light for the BF/BH samples
and the M 1-seeds. For the samples of ground control and for
acclerator experiments the limit was set by 48 hours illumination
after the end of vernalization; this was possible because of the large
sample sizes.<p>

The most obvious effects we get in embryo sterility which is
significantly higher for the flown M 1-seeds than for the other
samples. For comparison we show data of two accelerator experiments
which don't have a significant difference compared with the sterility
data of back up- and ground control. This shows that for the measured
M 1-seeds the strain of cosmic particle radiation and, possibly, the
stack influences in generative state is similar to the strain in
generative state caused by particle fluxes of 5 x 10 7 p/cm 2 of Ne
and Xe 19 Mev/n.<p>

This distinct deleterious cosmic HZE-radiation effect of M 1 seeds is
observed too in their M 2-descendants. The mutation rate R -
additional data for mutation frequency mc are given but not discussed
in detail - is significantly higher than the spontaneous mutation rate
(Table 2). The influence of particle radiation is shown by the
significant increase in the mutation rate R for measured M 2-samples.<p>

It shows that the mutation rate is additive to the spontaneous
mutation rate fifty to sixty times inceased. These results are five
times higher than R-values we ever obtained in accelerator experiments
(Bork and Kranz, 1984). Compared to the BF/BH samples and accelerator
sample the mutation rate is significantly increased. This effect is
obviously caused by the cosmic radiation, and an influence of the
insufficient stacking methods can be excluded.<p>

control-units (BF and BH) and accelerator experiments (last line).<p>

Even in this evaluation we didn't find a significant difference
between samples of small impact parameter to the shoot meristem and
samples of large impact parameters.<p>

From the data so far obtained we may conclude:<p>

1. The particle radiation causes damages, however, because of the
samples and the limited range of the track detectors it is at the
moment impossible to give a statistic report of the interdependence of
impact parameters and damages of plants. An improvement of the
measurement system is therefore necessary. An example of an evident
interdependence between impact parameters and damage is given in
Figure 1b.<p>

2. A negative influence of the stacking procedure is especially
visible in M 1, where effects on germination rate and germination time
are assumed. Control experiments proved these effects. The influence
of stacking does not occur in the M 2.<p>

3. In M 2 the mutation rate is significant increased for the measured
seeds. This increase is higher than the increases we obtained through
accelerator experiments. In dependence to 1. the sample is too small
to give a statistic report in the moment.<p>

4. All results of measured seeds show a large standard deviation as a
matter of the inhomogeneity of cosmic radiation.<p>

Further investigation will be concentrated to HZE-tracks with very
small impact parameters to fill up the deficiency in data.<p>
