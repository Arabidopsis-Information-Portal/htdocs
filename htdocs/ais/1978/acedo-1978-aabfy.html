In a previous report, a feedback control mechanism was implicated in
the regulation of the nitrogen metabolism of mutant A-154 (Acedo and
Redei, 1976). The mutant has relatively lower amino acid content than
the wild type, particularly glutamate. Therefore an investigation of
the enzyme activities in the biosynthetic path before glutamic acid is
in order.<p>

Nitrate reductase is of primary importance not only in understanding
the overall nitrogen metabolism, but also because of its practical
implications. Nitrate reductase is a rate limiting enzyme in the
reduction of NO3 to NH4 (Beevers and Hageman, 1969) so, nitrate
reductase activity can indicate the plants ability to assimilate
nitrogen and therefore its potential protein yield (Bar-Akiva et al.,
1970). It was suggested that plant breeders may utilize measurement of
nitrate reductase activity in screening for high yield and seed
protein content (Hageman et al., 1967). The regulation of nitrate
reductase activity although well elucidated in microorganisms, is less
well understood in higher plants. Repression of nitrate reductase
activity by amino acids in tobacco callus culture has been reported
(Filner, 1966). Induction of nitrate reductase activity by nitrate is
well documented in higher plants (Joy, 1969) including Arabidopsis
(Feenstra and Braaksma, 1976).<p>

Mutant A-154 has an inducible nitrate reductase system. The plants
were grown in minimal media with either NO3 or NH4 as nitrogen source.
After 20 days, the plants were assayed in vivo according to the method
of D.G. Blevins (personal communication). In vivo assays reflect to
more accurately the actual metabolism of the plant, although it yields
lower values than in vitro assays. The mutant and wild type plants,
each weighing 0.25 g were put in a flask with an infiltration medium
consisting of: 2.5 ml of 0.02 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8,
0.5 ml of .1 M KNO3, 0.25 ml ethyl alcohol and 1.75 ml water. The
flasks were evacuated, tightly stoppered and put at a 30*degree*C
water bath in the dark. After 30 minutes incubation, 2.5 ml of 1
percent sulfanilamide in 3N HC1 was added, followed by 2.5 ml of 0.02
percent N-1 naphthylethylenediamine in 95 percent ethyl alcohol. The
diazo complex formed was read in a spectrophotometer at 540 nm.<p>

Table 1 shows that nitrate reductase activity is increased in plants
grown in presence of NO3. The lower activity of mutant A-154 in plants
grown in NH4 NO3 may be an inhibition of nitrate reductase activity by
the NH4 ion. A similar inhibition of nitrate reductase activity was
observed by Smith and Thompson (1971) in barley roots and by Oaks et
al. (1977) in corn.<p>

A number of regulatory mechanisms has been identified in Arabidopsis
but unlike in simple prokaryotes, the regulatory control in higher
plants is complex and therefore difficult to define (Redei and Acedo,
1976). The inducibility of nitrate reductase in mutant A-154 and its
inhibition by NH4 and probably by amino acids is another regulatory
mechanism whose operation, once understood, will contribute to our
knowledge of how genes operate to control the flow of metabolites in
higher plants.<p>
