*Molecular Dissection of LRR Receptor Function 
* 
A postdoctoral research position is available with Andrew Bent to investigate the 
structure/function of leucine-rich repeat domains, with particular but not exclusive 
emphasis on plant disease resistance receptors such as FLS2.  LRRs are common in R 
gene products, innate immunity receptors, hormone receptors, proteins that control plant 
and animal development, and many other proteins.  We are investigating how LRR 
domains work in terms of ligand specificity and signaling activation, and are developing 
in vitro evolution methodologies to generate new receptors with novel ligand specificity 
(new pathogen recognition capability).  Recent papers include Sun et al. (2006) Plant Cell 
18:764 and Dunning et al. (2007) Plant Cell 19:3297.  See also 
http://www.plantpath.wisc.edu/fac/afb.htm.  Opportunities to build teaching/mentoring 
resume optionally available.  At University of Wisconsin -- Madison you can be 
guaranteed cold winters, beautiful summers, a popular and interesting living 
environment, and a large, interactive and highly successful community of plant and 
molecular biology researchers.  
Please send a letter of interest, curriculum vitae, and names and contact information for 
three personal references to afbent@wisc.edu.
