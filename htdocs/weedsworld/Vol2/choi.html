<H2>Abstract</H2>

        We constructed an ordered 3,948 clone Arabidopsis BAC library. The
library has a combined average insert size of 100 kb (n=54). Assuming a
haploid genome size of 100,000 kb, the BAC library contains 3.95 haploid
genome equivalents with a 98% probability of isolating a specific genomic
region. The library was screened with five Arabidopsis cDNA probes and one
tomato probe and all probes hybridized to at least one (in most cases
three) BAC clones in the library. <P>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

        The technique of chromosome walking provides a means of cloning any
gene identified by mutational analysis. <I>Arabidopsis thaliana</I> is the best
plant system to utilize this technique because of its small genome size,
low repetitive DNA content, availability of a dense genetic map and
existence of a large number of mapped probes. In order to facilitate
chromosome walking, libraries of the Arabidopsis  genome have been
constructed using yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) vectors (summarized in
Gibson and Somerville, 1992). The primary advantage of YACs is the
potential for cloning large insert sizes (ranging from 100 to 150 kb for <I>A.
thaliana</I>  "abi1", "U", and "EW" libraries). Despite the successes of the
YAC vector cloning system, many problems exist which include chimerism and
tedious steps in the manipulation and isolation of YAC insert DNA. <P>
        Utilizing an F factor derived cloning system, bacterial artificial
chromosome (BAC) vectors have been used to clone human DNA with inserts as
large as 300 kb (Shizuya <I>et al</I>., 1992) and plant (sorghum, Woo <I>et al</I>.,
1994; rice, Zhang H.B., S. Choi, S.-S. Woo, R.A. Wing, personal
communication) DNA with inserts averaging 157 and 140 kb, respectively.
BACs are maintained as single copy plasmids in E. coli and exclude other
BAC plasmids from replicating in the same host cell. Advantages of BACs
over YACs include lower levels of chimerism and ease of library generation
and insert manipulation. Techniques also exist to isolate the proximal ends
of fragments inserted into the BAC vector (Woo <I>et al</I>., 1994). In this
report, we describe the construction and characterization of an <I>A. thaliana</I>
BAC library.

<H2>Materials and Methods</H2>


<H3>Plant Material</H3>

        <I>Arabidopsis thaliana</I> ecotype Columbia was grown in soil at 22 C under short days (11 h
light) for 3 to 5 weeks. <P>

<H3>BAC Library Construction and Characterization</H3>

        Megabase size DNA was prepared from <I>A. thaliana</I> nuclei embedded in
agarose microbeads as described (Zhang <I>et al</I>., 1995). Size selection of a
HindIII partial digest was carried out in a 1% low melting point agarose
gel at 4.0 V/cm with a 5 s pulse for 10 h at 11 C in  and ligated to
dephosphorylated pBeloBAC11 (Woo <I>et al</I>., 1994). Ligation material was used
to transform DH10B (BRL) using a BRL Cell-Porator system (Woo <I>et al</I>.,
1994). Transformed cells were resuspended in SOC, incubated at 37 C for
one h, and plated onto LB agar containing 12.5 mg/ml chloramphenicol,  0.5
mM IPTG and 40 mg/ml X-Gal. White colonies were transferred to microtiter
plates containing LB freezing buffer (Woo <I>et al</I>., 1994), incubated at 37C
for 24 h and then stored at -80 C. <P>

<H3>Recombinant BAC DNA Isolation, Restriction, and CHEF Analysis</H3>

        BACs containing <I>A. thaliana</I> DNA were isolated from 5 ml overnight
cultures (LB plus 12.5 mg/ml chloramphenicol) using standard alkaline lysis
procedures and resuspended in TE.  BAC DNA was digested with NotI to free
the genomic DNA from the 7.4 kb vector. The digested DNA was separated by
electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel in 0.5x TBE at 11 C using a Bio-Rad
CHEF Mapper set at 6 v/cm with a linear pulse time ramping from 5 to 15 s
for 16 h. <P>

<H3>BAC Library Screening</H3>

        Hybond N+ filters placed on LB plus 12.5 mg/ml chloramphenicol were
innoculated with 3456 BAC clones using a Biomek 2000 Robotics Workstation
(Beckman). After 12 to 18 h at 37 C, clonies were lysed and DNA fixed to
filters using standard methods (Woo <I>et al</I>., 1994).  Prehybridization,
hybridization and filter washing were preformed as described (Woo <I>et al</I>.,
1994). Probes were obtained using gel purified cDNA inserts labelled using
the random primer synthesis procedure.

<H2>Results and Discussion</H2>

        We constructed an ordered 3,948 clone Arabidopsis BAC library. The
library has a combined average inset size of 100 kb (Figure 1, Figure 2).
Assuming a haploid genome size of 100,000 kb, the BAC library contains 3.95
haploid genome equivalents with a 98% probability of isolating a specific
genomic region. <P>

        To evaluate the BAC  library, it was screened with five Arabidopsis
cDNA probes and one tomato probe. All probes hybridized to at least one BAC
clone in the library. While clone stability has not been evaluated for the
Arabidopsis BAC library, in Sorghum and rice BAC clones are extremely
stable (Woo <I>et al</I>., 1994; Zhang H.B., S. Choi, S.-S. Woo, R.A. Wing,
personel communication). Four Sorghum BAC clones ranging in size from 250
to 315 kb were stable for over 100 generations. In addition, no chimerism
was detected using 11 Sorghum BAC clones  hybridized to metaphase and
interphase Sorghum nuclei (Woo <I>et al</I>., 1994). <P>
        Based on considerations of stability, ease of isolation, yield, and
size, the Ariabidosis BAC library would seem ideally suited for use in the
Arabidoposis genome sequencing project or gene isolation by chromosome
walking.  Isolation of YAC inserts requires standard megabase DNA
isolation, CHEF electrophoresis and gel isolation which may take 3 to 5
days to complete. In addition to low YAC yields, separation of a YAC from
endogenous yeast chromosomes may not be possible. In contrast, BAC DNA
isolation uses standard plasmid DNA techniques to exploit the ability to
separate supercoiled plasmid DNA from bacterial genomic DNA. This rapid
separation reduces the time for BAC insert isolation to 1.5 to 2 days,
including CHEF analysis. <P>
