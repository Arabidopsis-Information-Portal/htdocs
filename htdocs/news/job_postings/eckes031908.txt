PostDoc Position at Bayer CropScience


 
Bayer CropScience in Frankfurt is looking for a PostDoc in a tri-national research 
program (Germany, France, Spain) which has started in May 2007 and goes until May 
2010  
 
In this project the effect of several chemical compounds, which have shown to reduce 
stress symptoms in plants, on the transcriptome, proteome and metabolome of such plants 
will be analyzed.  
Specific indicator genes for the compound effects will be identified. These indicator 
genes will later be used to establish a biological screen for other compounds that are 
beneficial for plant growth under stress conditions.  
 
The PostDoc would have the following tasks:  
- establish stress assays in the growth chamber for model and crop plants  
- perform and analyze transcription profiling experiments with the model plant 
Arabidopsis under different stress and non stress conditions  
- select indicator genes (with additional input from proteome and metabolome analyses)  
- identify their orthologs in other crop plant species  
- evaluate the behavior of the orthologs under the specific stress conditions  
- fuse promoters of the verified genes to marker genes to establish a screening assay for 
other anti stress compounds  
- verify the screening assay with selected compounds  
 
For these purposes the PostDoc should already have some years of laboratory experience 
in the field of Molecular Biology (e.g. from an earlier PostDoc position). Experience in 
the field of plant responses to abiotic stress factors would be very helpful. The applicant 
should have excellent experimental and organisational skills and a profound knowledge 
in Bioinformatics. Because the PostDoc will work in a tri-national project, excellent 
knowledge of the English language and the ability to work in an international team are a 
prerequisite. Nevertheless the PostDoc should be able to work on his project very 
independently.  
 
To apply, please send a full C.V. including a cover letter,a brief description of research 
experience and interests, and names/email addresses of three references via email to:
