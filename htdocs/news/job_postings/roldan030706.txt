A postdoctoral position is available at the University of Cordoba
(Spain) to study DNA repair in Arabidopsis. Research in our laboratory
is primarily focused on understanding mechanisms that maintain genome
stability in plants (see, for example, reference below).  Research approaches 
currently being used include
forward and reverse genetics, molecular biology, cell biology,
biochemistry, and genomics.

The successful candidate must have a recent Ph.D (within the past five
years) and a strong background in the fields of plant biology, genetics,
molecular biology or biochemistry. Previous experience with Arabidopsis
is helpful, but not required. Individuals with strong self-motivation,
team-work capacity, and good communication skills are highly preferred.
The initial appointment will be for one year starting May 2006, and the
reappointment will depend on successful performance.

Please e-mail a cover letter summarizing your research interests,
experience, and achievements, a curriculum vitae, a list of
publications, and contact information for three references to:
