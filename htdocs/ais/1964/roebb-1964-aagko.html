Vol 01:<h2>ROBBELEN, G.</h2><h2>Sensitivity pattern of germination in chemomutagenesis</h2>

After presoaking dry seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana (race Enkheim) on
wet filter paper for different intervals the effect of mutagenic
treatment with some alkylating chemicals, urethans and X-rays was
measured with the M2-chlorophyll-mutation test.  According to our
expectation the mutation rate was increased with increasing time of
presoaking, though in the chemical treatments certainly dry seeds
would absorb the maximum amount of the mutagen.  The maximum of this
intensifying effect of presoaking, however, appeared at a different
point of the curves in the three cases mentioned.  With ethyl
methanesulfonat (EMS) as well as with other alkylating agents (diethyl
sulfate, or ethylene imine) the highest mutation frequency occurred
after 15 hrs presoaking, while phenyl ethyl urethans had a maximum
efficiency after 48 hrs and X-rays after 24 hrs of the same
pretreatment.  This is indicative for a different sensitivity pattern
in the course of germination, when mutagens with different mechanism
of reaction are applied.  A more detailed analysis of this effect is
thought to be valuable for a better understanding of the mutation
process in higher plants.<p>
