Vol 01:<h2>REDEI, G. P.</h2><h2>Crossing experiences with polyploids</h2>

Some aneuploids and polyploids have been found.  With an
autotetraploid (K-16), an approximately autohexaploid (M-10) and our
standard diploid wild (W) some crosses were made resulting in the
following observations.<p>

This incomplete information indicates that the cross compatibility 
of Arabidopsis polyploids is similar to that of other species, namely 
the seed set is better if the female is the higher chromosome number 
parent.  It may be noted furthermore that the hexaploids are separated 
from the diploids with an almost complete sterility barrier while 
tetraploids and hexaploids can be intercrossed readily.  It appears thus 
that gene transfer from diploids to higher ploids will be easier 
stepwise.<p>
