Post Doctoral positions in Soybean Proteomics and Metabolomics 
 
 
 
Two postdoctoral research associate positions are available immediately at University of 
Missouri-Columbia (MU) to investigate the soybean proteome and metabolome. This is a 
collaborative project with Prof. Dong Xu who is an expert in bioinformatics and 
computational biology. The successful candidates will employ GC-MS and LC-MS 
systems to profile proteins and metabolites in soybean seed and root tissues. Applicants 
should have a PhD in chemistry, biochemistry, or a related discipline reflecting a strong 
background in GC-MS or LC-MS analysis applied to proteomics or metabolomics. 
Expertise in plant biochemistry is highly desirable. Applications will be considered until 
suitable candidates are identified. Salary will be commensurate with experience and 
qualifications. Applicants should provide a letter of interest, a complete CV, and contact 
information for three references, to be sent to: 
 
Dr. Henry T. Nguyen (nguyenhe@missouri.edu <mailto:nguyenhe@missouri.edu> ) 
and/or Dr. Gary Stacey (staceyg@missouri.edu), National Center for Soybean 
Biotechnology, 271 Christopher S. Bond Life Sciences Center, University of Missouri, 
Columbia, MO 65211.  University of Missouri is an equal opportunity/ADA institution
