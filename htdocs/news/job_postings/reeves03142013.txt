Independent Research Fellowships 
*We particularly welcome enquiries by Friday 5 April, 2013.* 

The Department of Plant Sciences at the University of Oxford is keen to hear from early career 
researchers who feel they have what it takes to secure a fellowship from one of the UK or international 
research sponsors and become an Independent Research Fellow in the Department. Such fellowship 
schemes enable the best early career researchers to establish themselves as independent research 
fellows with their own research groups. The fellowships are prestigious and competitive. Sponsors’ 
eligibility criteria apply. 

We can support the best candidates to apply for fellowships. We are also keen to hear from fellows 
who may wish to transfer a current fellowship to the Department. To enquire about becoming an Independent 
Research Fellow in the Department of Plant Sciences, please email a 2-page summary of your research plan 
and your CV to debbie.reeves@plants.ox.ac.uk
