Post-doctoral position available in the Peer lab, Purdue University
Role of APM1 and interacting proteins in root meristem maintenance and seedling 
establishment
The Peer lab group studies seedling establishment, meristem maintenance, and the role of 
small molecule regulators in these processes. A single copy gene encoding a member of 
the M1 family of zinc metallopeptidases, Aminopeptidase M1 (APM1) regulates root 
meristem maintenance in Arabidopsis and is required for normal root development (Peer 
et al, 2009). APM1 is a dual-function protein with enzymatic and cellular 
trafficking/protein interaction activities. We have several apm1 alleles with mutations 
affecting the enzymatic activity and the trafficking/protein-protein interactions 
independently. APM1-interacting proteins have been identified, some of which have 
similar phenotypes to APM1 loss-of-function mutants, suggesting targets of 
APM1acitivity. The successful candidate will have opportunities to lead and develop his 
or her area of research by combining his/her expertise with those of the group and 
establish his/her own field. The applicant should have a Ph.D. or equivalent in biology or 
related discipline. Experience in some or all of the following disciplines is desirable: 
genetics in model systems, molecular biology, and/or biochemistry. A strong background 
in plant biology is preferred. Interested individuals should email a letter of inquiry stating 
research interests along with a CV to Wendy Peer (peer@purdue.edu).
