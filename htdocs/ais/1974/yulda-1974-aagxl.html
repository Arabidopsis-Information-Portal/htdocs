A technique has been elaborated for obtaining microtome sections
(glass knife) of Arabidopsis thaliana seeds.<p>

C6H1402 was used for the polymerization; as the initiator served the
DDSA, 20 ml pr 10 ml of butylmetacrylate. The polymerization took
place at 60*degrees*C in the course of 72 hours.  The seeds were fixed
by 1% OsO4 in the phosphate buffer. The fixation by osmium with the
following dyeing by methyl green provided a distinct picture of the
zone (Fig 1b) and the nature (Fig. 1c) of damages in the seeds as a
result of the laser irradiation (lamba = 6943 angstrom, tau = 10**8
sec.)  The density of the irradiation varied between 3 and 7
J/cm. Fig. 1 represents the sections of the control and the
experimental material.<p>

The experiment has shown that osmium incorporated inside the seeds due
to the destruction of the envelope and a part of inner components
caused by the laser irradiation.  In addition, the dark area depended
upon the dose of the irradiation. Fig 1c shows the section dyed by
methyl green. We observe the break of the envelope, the coagulated
aleurone grains, representing some store protein, and the
disconnection between the cells.  On this basis it was concluded that
the detonation wave and temperature might be possible factors of laser
irradiation on the seeds.<p>

As a result of the irradiation we observed empty cells in the seed
sections. The nature of these empty cells is not clear, and further
electron-microscopic study would give probably the explanation of this
phenomenon.  It is also noteworthy that empty cells as well as the
break of contact between the cells and the coagulated aleurone grains
occur too in the sections where the seed peel (testa) has not been
damaged. This fact indicates, that apart from the detonation wave and
temperature, the damage effect is also related to the wave length of
the laser irradiation.<p>
