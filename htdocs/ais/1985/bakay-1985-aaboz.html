<h2>INFLUENCE OF PH ON THE ACTIVITY OF RIBOSOPHOSPHATEISOMERASE OF ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA LEAVES IN RACE ENKHEIM AND ITS MUTANTS, TRIPLEX AND 58/15</h2>

In the active enzyme centre there are ionizing groups, taking part in
a catalytic action. Studying the influence of pH on the enzyme
activity, we can define these ionizing groups.<p>

Ribosophosphateisomerase (RPI, C.P. 5.3.1.6) was purified to the
homogenous condition according to our previous method (Bakayeva and
Babadzhanova, 1982). The enzyme activity was defined by the carbosole
method (Hurwitz et al., 1951) and the amount of protein by the method
of Lowry et al. (1951). The reaction with specific inhibitors was
carried out by the method described in the practical guide of Kochetov
(1980). Figure 1 presents data on the influence of pH on the RPI
activity. The maximum activity is observed when pH is 7.0.<p>

Calculations in lgv/pH coordinates (Figure 1) show the bends when pH
for RPI from leaves of race Enkheim is equal to 6.4 and 7.5, from
leaves of mutant triplex 6.7 and 7.6, and from leaves of mutant 58/15
6.6 and 7.8. According to Edsalls table (Dixon and Webb, 1979) we
found the enzyme to have two specific ionizing groups: either two
aminogroups in *alpha*-cysteine and one aminogroup in
(*alpha*-cysteine and one sulphydrogenous group.<p>

type (En) and two mutants (Tr, and 58/15)<p>

To clear up the role of amino- and sulphydrogenous groups, the
activity of RPI was determined in the presence of specific inhibitors,
namely the acetic anhydride and pyridoxale-5-phosphate for aminogroups
and parachlormercurybenzoate (PCMB) for sulphydrogenous groups.<p>

According to our results, the activity of RPI from leaves of race
Enkheim as well as of mutants triplex and 58/15 under the action of
acetic anhydride and pyridoxale-5-phosphate, decreases by 38-40
percent, and under the action of PCMB it decreases by 41-42 percent.
Under the combined action of acetic anhydride and PCMB, the activity
of RPI decreases by 37-40 percent, i.e., intensification of inhibition
cannot be observed.<p>

Table 1: Influence of amino- and sulphydrogenous groups on the
activity of RPI.<p>

Thus, two ionizing groups take part in a catalytic action, pH of which
probably corresponds to either two aminogroups in *alpha*-cysteine or
one amino- and one sulphydrogenous group. However, proceeding from the
character of inhibition by PCMB and acetic anhydride we may suppose
that other enzyme conformations exist when ionization is defined by
the other ionizing groups.<p>
