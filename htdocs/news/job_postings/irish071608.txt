Two full time postdoctoral associate positions are available in the laboratory of Dr. 
Vivian Irish, Dept. of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology, Yale University. 
 
Arabidopsis petal development:  The successful candidate will employ a variety of 
molecular genetic techniques and modeling approaches to elucidate the dynamics of 
transcriptional networks controlling petal organogenesis.  Applicants should have 
experience in Arabidopsis molecular genetics, QTL analyses, and/or systems biology. 
 
Comparative analyses of flower and fruit development: The successful candidate will 
examine the changing roles of key transcription factors in regulating flower and fruit 
formation.  This project will focus on utilizing genetically tractable members of the 
Solanaceae, and tomato in particular. Applicants should have experience in molecular 
genetics and phylogenetic analyses.   
For either position, a Ph.D. degree in molecular genetics, plant biology, or related field is 
required.  Interested applicants should send a C.V., list of publications, brief summary of 
research experience and future goals, and names and addresses of three referees by email 
to Vivian Irish (Vivian.irish@yale.edu).  Review of applications will begin immediately 
and continue until positions are filled. For further information on the lab interests, please
