Vol 01S: <h2>Comparative Studies on the Induction of Recessive Lethals by Various Mutagens</h2><p>

A.J. MULLER<p>

During the last years we have carried out investigations on the
mutagenic activity of X-rays and chemical agents in Arabidopsis
thaliana (cf. MULLER, 1965b). This paper is intended to point out some
differences and similarities in the genetic effects of the following
mutagens: ethyl methanesulphonate, N-nitroso-N-methylurea, (cf.
MULLER, 1964a), N-nitroso-N-ethylurea, N-nitroso-N-methylurethane,
N-nitrose-N- methyl-N'-nitroguanidine (cf. MULLER and GICHNER, 1964)
and X-rays.<p>

In all experiments presoaked but not yet germinating seeds were
treated with the mutagen. The following effects are to be considered
in this comparison:<p>

1) inhibition of growth of primary roots,<p>

2) sterility of M1 plants,<p>

3) frequency of recessive lethals (separately as frequency of
embryonic lethals and frequency of lethal chlorophyll mutations),<p>

4) size of the mutated sector in the lower part of the main
inflorescence.<p>

The mutations were scored by the embryo test (MULLER, 1963).  The
methods used for determining the mutation frequency are essentially
the same as described in earlier publications (MULLER, 1964a, 1965a).
Thus, three measures have been determined: frequency of segregating
plant progenies (ma), frequency of segregating silique progenies (mb)
, and frequency of M2 mutants (mc). Under the supposition that the
mutations are distributed in good accordance with the Poison
distribution, the following estimates for the mean number of mutations
per treated meristem cell may be calculated:<p>
<pre>
  Mb = -ln (1 - mb)
  Mc = -ln (1 - mc)/f{bar}
</pre>


(where f{bar} is the mean frequency of recessives in segregating
progenies, for which an approximate value of f{bar} = 0.21 has been
determined.)<p>

In order to compare various mutagens the effects specified above will
be related to the mean number of recessive lethals per cell (Mc).
Differences in the effectivity, that means in the dose-effect
relationship, and possibilities of influencing the effectivity are not
to be considered. It may be mentioned, however, that the nitrosamides
show a much higher molar effectivity than other chemical mutagens
hitherto tested in higher plants (cf. MULLER, 1965b).<p>

Concerning the relation between inhibition of root growth and mutation
frequency it may be pointed out, that for the same reduction of the
length of primary roots ethyl methanesulphonate and the nitrosamides
tested induce 20 to 30 times more mutations than X-rays do (cf.
MULLER, 1964a, b, 1965b). Therefore, these chemicals can be classified
as mutagens with an extremely low relative toxicity. The more drastic
inhibition of root growth after X-raying is connected with a higher
relative frequency of gross chromosome aberrations.<p>

Degree of sterility: The degree of sterility is calculated from the
number of fertilized ovules in the basal siliques of the main
inflorescence (MULLER, 1964a). Thus, it represents only the
haplophasic lethality. Naturally, it may be influenced, too, by the
number of ovules per silique and by the environmental conditions in
the time of pollination. The experiments were carried out in such a
way that these influences cannot play an important role.<p>

In Figure 1 the degree of sterility is plotted against the frequency
of recessive lethals. It is evident that with increasing dose the
degree of sterility becomes steadily increased. Between the chemical
agents considered there are no significant differences as to the shape
of the curve. After treatment with X-rays, however, the degree of
sterility increases more rapidly. Compared with the chemical agents,
about 4 times (in the lower dose range) to 6 times (in higher dose
range) less mutations occurred for the same degree of sterility.<p>

Considering the multiplicity of possible causes for haplophasic
lethality an interpetation of these results is difficult.<p>

of recessive lethals per cell (Mc) after treatment with X-rays (open

(partially filled circles), nitroso-N-methylurethane (filled squares),
or N- nitroso-N-methyl-N'-nitroguanidine (open squares)<p>

However, there are some facts indicating that both after X-raying and
after treatment with the chemicals considered the induced sterility is
essentially caused by haplophasic lethal mutations (MULLER, 1964a,
1965c). Physiological influences play, if at all, only a very small
role. This is also supported by the fact that all five chemical
mutagens show essentially the same proportionality between the degree
of sterility and the mutation frequency.<p>

The more rapid increase of the degree of sterility observed after
treatment with X-rays may be due to the higher relative frequency of
gross chromosome aberrations, especially of translocations. But there
is no reason to postulate a direct proportionally between the
frequency of translocations and the frequency of haplophasic lethals.
Chemically induced haplophasic lethality may frequently be associated
with small deletions, the frequency of which was found to be
extraordinarily high in Drosphila after treatment with formaldehyde
(SLIZYNSKA, 1963).<p>

Ratio of chlorophyll mutations to embryonic lethals: The recessive
lethals may be subdivided into two groups with clearly distinguished
lethal phases (MULLER, 1963). 1) Embryonic lethals and 2) lethal
chlorophyll mutations (fusca, albina, xantha, chlorina). In Figure 2
the proportion of chlorophyll mutations among the total number of
recessive lethals ??? is plotted against the mean number of recessive
lethals per cell (Mc).<p>

and the mean number of recessive lethals per cell (Mc).  Explanation of
symbols see Figure 1<p>

It is evident that with increasing dose the proportion of chlorophyll
mutations decreases, and thus the proportion of embryonic lethals
increases. Again, there is a more rapid increase after X-raying than
after treatment with chemicals. It seemed that the chemical mutagens
considered do not differ from each other in this respect.  However,
the values are varying too much to allow a definite statement.  As an
interesting fact, in the lower dose range there are no clear-cut
differences between X-rays and the chemical agents, too.  In both
cases the proportion of chlorophyll mutations was found to be about 20
percent. Therefore, it becomes evident that statements on mutagen-
conditioned differences in the relative frequency of a mutation type
defined phenotypically are only suggestive, if they are referred to a
distinct value of the mutation frequency.<p>

The increase of the proportion of embryonic lethals with increasing
dose suggests to suppose a two-hit kinetics for part of these
mutations. But in this case we have to accept that after treatment
with chemical agents in very high doses at least one half of the
embryonic lethals represent two-hit events. This conclusion, however,
discords with the finding that in barley ethyl methanesulphonate
induces much less translocations than chlorophyll mutations
(FROESE-GERTAEN et al., 1964). Therefore, it must be tested which
other factors (e.g., diplontic selection) are responsible for the
increase of the proportion of embryonic lethals.<p>

The finding that in the lower dose range there are no significant
differences between X-rays and the chemical agents considered is open
for two alternative interpretations: 1) It will be assumed that
chlorophyll mutations more frequently represent point mutations than
embryonic lethals do. Under these circumstances we have to conclude
that there are no differences between the mutagens tested with regard
to the ratio of point mutations to chromosome breaks. 2) It may be
assumed that this ratio is higher after treatment with chemical
mutagens than after X-raying. In this case we must infer that in the
lower dose range chlorophyll mutations do not more frequently
represent point mutations than embryonic lethals do.<p>

The size of the mutated sector: By analysis of the progenies of 5
successive siliques of the main inflorescence the relative size of the
mutated sector in this region (b) may be estimated (MULLER, 1965a).
The mean value of sector size is calculated as frequency of
segregating silique progenies among the total number of progenies
tested in mutated plants, thus as b{bar} = mb/ma. This equation is
only correct if no more than one mutation occurs in each inflorescence
primordium, therefore, only with lower mutation frequencies. For
higher mutation frequencies the mean sector size is calculated by the
approximate formula:<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol01S/vol01S-pg195-tab0.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

which is based on the Poisson distribution.<p>

Figure 3 shows that with very low doses the mean sector size is about
b{bar} = 0.30. In the case of X-rays, this value increases with increasing dose
up to b{bar} = 0.75.. This increase in sector size known also from experiments
with barley (GAUL, 1965) may be interpreted as a consequence of
radiation damage in the apical meristem followed by regeneration of
the shoot apex from a few cells. After treatment with chemical agents
a significant increase of sector size cannot be proved. Although with
higher mutation frequences the values calculated may be somewht
biased, a clear-cut difference to X-rays is evident.<p>

In analogy to the occurrence of fractional mutations in Drosophila, it
might have been expected that chemical mutagens lead to smaller
sectors than X-rays do, even with lower doses. Obviously , this is not
the case. Thus, the mean sector size is independent of whether the
mutations are "fractionals" or not. This statement is in good
accordance with the general conceptions on the mode of development of
plant meristems.<p>

Concluding remarks: This short summary of some results from various
experiments could not, of course, be more than a pointing out of some
aspects and problems. It was intended mainly to show up in which way
the relations between various genetic effects are dependent on the
mutagen used and its dose. The relations found may be used as hints
for the interpretation of the effects and thus are stimulating
starting points for further experiments.<p>

It is of special interest, that there are no striking differences
between nitrosamides and EMS as far as the spectrum of genetic effects
is concerned. Thus the results are not in contrast with the assumption
that nitrosmides - like EMS - acts as monofunctional alkylating
agents.  The increase of mutation frequency induced by the chemical
agents tested was found to be limited only by the increasing
sterility. Therefore, a mutagen with still higher efficiency would be
expected to fulfill the following points: 1) The relative toxicity
should not be significantly higher and 2) the relation "sterility
degree/mutation frequency" should be lower. A mutagen following these
proposals has not yet been found in experiments with higher plants.<p>

Discussion:<p>

REDEI: How do you test the embryonic lethals genetically and
distinguish them from physiological lethals?<p>

MULLER: In control series grown under similar conditions 1.5 to 3% of
the siliques contained lethal embryos (M2). By testing the progenies
(M3) we found that in 0.4% to 0.7% of the siliques these lethal
embryos had been caused by recessive lethal factors (spontaneous
mutation).  Therefore, in the remaining 1 to 2% of the siliques the
embryonic lethality was brought forth by physiological factors or by
newly arising dominant lethals. In these siliques we never found more
than 4 lethal embryos. The total frequency of spontaneous lethal
embryos (recessive lethal factors excluded) was 0.05% (141 lethal
embryos among 300,000 embryos tested). Under unfavourable conditions
this value may be higher (cf. A.J. MULLER: Biol. Zbl. 82, 133, 1963).
Of course, in treated series it is difficult to recognize and increase
in the frequency of spontaneous lethal embryos, but it is not
impossible. In this case the distribution of the number of lethal
embryos per silique progeny is deviating. Furthermore, there are some
types of malformations which are caused exclusively by physiological
factors. Provided that the M1-plants are well developed and the
frequency of segregating silique progenies is not higher than about
70%, spontaneous lethal embryos seem to be not more frequent in
treated series than in control series.<p>

REDEI: Dominant lethals can not be separated from the physiological
defects of X-rays. Were these embryonic lethals classified in the
immediate treated generation or in the 2nd generation?<p>

MULLER: As a routine technique only the siliques of the M1-plants,
that means the M2-embryos, are tested.<p>

REDEI: So these were genetic differences?<p>

MULLER: Yes<p>

REDEI: And were these all recessives?<p>

MULLER: Yes. The routine technique is mainly based on the following
experiment: Seeds were treated with X-rays. Among 203 M1- plants we
found 56 plants with lethal or chlorophyll deficient embryos.  From
these plants the M2-progenies were grown and the M3 analysed. In each
progeny we found heterozygotes for one or two recessive lethal
factors. These lethals could be found in the following generations,
too.  In this random sample of 60 recessive lethal factors about 50%
of the factors segregate with a normal 3:1 ratio. The other 50% have a
more complicated mode of inheritance, resulting mostly in a deficit of
recessives. After treatment of seeds dominant lethals are expected to
become filtered out during the course of development of the M1-plants.
In order to study the relationship between dominant and recessive
lethals we have irradiated pollen, too (cf. A. J. MULLER:
Kulturpflanze 13, in press, 1965). In this case the situation is more
clear (only one genome is irradiated; dominant lethals are
detectable). Concerning the recessive lethals the results were
essentially the same as after irradiation of seeds.<p>

BROWN: Perhaps you could draw a flow diagram indicating the procedure
used in making the test which enabled you to classify the recessives?<p>

MULLER: The methods and the main results are already published (cf.
l.c.). An example may be seen in the table. This embryonic lethal
mutation (vana-1397) segregates as a recessive factor with a slight
deficit of recessives. More detailed studies of complicated modes of
inheritance are underway. It may be mentioned that recessive lethals
represent a mixture of various types of mutations, e.g., point
mutation, deletions, translocation, etc. Therefore it is not
surprising that we found many recessive lethals with deviating
segregation ratios.  Unfortunately, Arabidopsis is not a suitable
object for a cytological analysis of the nature of our recessive
lethals.<p>

FEENSTRA: Did I understand you well that in all chemicals used, you
tested different concentrations?<p>

MULLER: The data presented here are mainly from experiments in which
the concentration has been varied. But there were also experiments
with varying treatment time or treatment temperature. The highest
concentrations led to nearly complete sterility.<p>

FEENSTRA: And on the correlation between mutation frequency and
sterility you concluded that the sterility is based genetically.<p>

MULLER: Provided, the environmental conditions are favourable for
pollination, the "degree of sterility" is an approximate measure of
the haplophasic lethality. Investigations of the progenies of partial
sterile M1-plants have shown that, as a rule, the induced haplophasic
lethality has a genetic basis. More detailed studies are underway. Of
course, we can't exclude that physiological and environmental
conditions also influence the degree of sterility.  Therefore,
differences in the degree of sterility do not necessarily mean that
there are different frequencies of haplophasic lethal mutations.<p>
