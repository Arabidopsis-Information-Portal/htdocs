*  As part of our continuing project on the isolation of genes expressed 
specifically in Arabidopsis thaliana shoots, it was necessary to generate a 
shoot-specific cDNA library.  To obtain a library of near full-length inserts 
the polyadenylated RNA sample from which the cDNA is synthesised 
should be as undegraded as possible.  To this end the following protocol 
has been used in our laboratory to obtain total RNA from Arabidopsis 
thaliana leaves and from shoots generated in vitro.

1.  EQUIPMENT

 *  To obtain undegraded samples of RNA it is important that all equipment 
and solutions used  in the preparation are free from ribonuclease 
(RNase).  All solutions should be made up in  RNase-free water and 
autoclaved prior to use.  Water can be made RNase-free by adding 1 ml  
diethyl pyrocarbonate (Sigma) per litre distilled water, stirring for two 
hours and autoclaving.   Our preparations were carried out using sterile 
15 ml polypropylene tubes (Sarstedt).  These  were assumed to be 
RNase-free, but if glass tubes are used they should be thoroughly  
cleaned and baked at 180oC for two hours before use.  All other 
equipment (mortar and  pestle, spatulas) was soaked in 0.1% (w/v) SDS 
overnight and rinsed in RNase-free water prior  to use.  Sterile or baked 
glass Pasteur pipettes should be used.  As skin can be a potential  
source of RNase, gloves should be worn throughout the preparation.

2.  PROCEDURE
  (i)  Homogenise 3 g of tissue with 2 ml 0.1M Tris-HCl (pH 9.0)  in a mortar 
and pestle kept cold on ice.  Remove the homogenate to a 15 ml tube, 
wash out the mortar and pestle with 1 ml 0.1M Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) and pool 
the washings with the homogenate.
 *  High pH inhibits RNase.

  (ii)  Add to the homogenate a 1/10 vol of 5% (w/v) SDS in 0.1 M Tris-HCl 
(pH 9.0) and gently shake the solution on ice for two min to denature the 
protein.
  (iii) Add an equal volume of phenol buffered to pH 9.0 (as in T. Maniatis 
et al. (1982) Molecular Cloning - A Laboratory Manual , Cold Spring Harbour 
Laboratory) to the homogenate and vortex-mix the resulting 
emulsion intermittently for five min with frequent cooling on 
ice.  Separate the phases by centrifuging for two min at 
4000xg in a benchtop centrifuge (MSE Centaur 2E) and 
remove the upper aqueous layer to a new 15 ml tube.  Add 
1 ml 0.1M Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) to the remaining interfacial 
protein layer and phenol phase and re-extract by vortex-
mixing.  Following centrifugation, pool the upper layer with 
the previous aqueous phase.  Discard the interfacial layer 
and phenol phase.
  (iv) Re-extract the pooled aqueous layers with an equal volume of 
buffered phenol until no residual interfacial protein layer is observed.  Do 
a final extraction with an equal volume of buffered 
phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, v/v/v).
  (v) Precipitate the nucleic acids from the final aqueous phase by 
addition of a 1/10 vol of 5M NaCl and 2 vol of 100% ethanol.  Store at - 
20oC for at least one h to complete precipitation.
  (vi) Spin down the precipitated nucleic acids and wash the pellet with 2 
ml of 70% (v/v) aqueous ethanol.
  (vii) Air-dry the pellet and dissolve the nucleic acids in 1-2 ml 10mM Tris-
HCl (pH 7.4) containing 10mM MgCl2.
  (viii) Remove the DNA from the solution by adding 20 ug of a 1 mgml-1 
deoxyribonuclease 1 solution (RNase-free, obtained from Gibco Ltd., 
dissolved in 10mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, containing 10mM MgCl2) and 
incubating on ice for 45 min.
  (ix) Deproteinise the resulting RNA solution by extracting with equal 
volumes of buffered phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol until no 
interfacial layer is seen.
  (x) Remove traces of phenol by a final extraction with an equal volume 
of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1, v/v) and precipitate out the RNA 
from the final aqueous phase by addition of a 1/10 vol of 5M NaCl and 2 
volumes 100% ethanol.  Store at -20oC overnight to complete 
precipitation.

 *  The purity of the resulting RNA preparation can be examined by 
dissolving the sample in  RNase-free water and measuring the ratio of 
absorbances at 280 and 260 nm: a ratio of about 2.0 should be 
obtained. The yield can be determined from the absorbance value at 
260 nm where 40 ug of RNA in 1 ml and a 1 cm light path has an 
absorbance of 1.0.  Yields of between 100-200 ug were obtained from 3 
g of shoot or leaf tissue.  Polyadenylated RNA can be  isolated from the 
total RNA preparation by affinity chromatography on an oligo-dT
