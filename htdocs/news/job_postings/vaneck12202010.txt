Bioinformatics Summer Internship, The Boyce Thompson Institute at Cornell University 

Be part of an exciting research project in the summer of 2011. The project is a large international 
effort to sequence the tomato genome. You can learn more about the project by visiting the SOL 
Genomics Network (SGN; http://solgenomics.net) and clicking on the link for the International Tomato 
Project. 

Students will work under the direction of a small team of bioinformaticians. We are seeking highly 
motivated individuals with strong interests in computers and/or biology to work on computational 
projects such as web-programming of new tools for plant scientists and designing and implementing 
relational databases for genomics applications. Knowledge of programming is desired. 

Compensation is provided through a stipend. In addition, a predetermined amount of funds is available 
towards travel expenses and to cover housing for students outside the Ithaca, NY area. 

Graduate students are not eligible for this internship. 
Applications are available at http://solgenomics.net/outreach. The application deadline is March 7, 
2011. 

For additional information, contact Dr. Joyce Van Eck (jv27@cornell.edu).
