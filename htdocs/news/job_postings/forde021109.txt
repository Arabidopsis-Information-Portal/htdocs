Applications are invited for a BBSRC-funded multidisciplinary PhD studentship entitled: 
 
"Developing a computational model to predict nutritional effects on root system architecture". 
 
The project supervisors are Prof. Brian G. Forde and Prof Ian Marshall who are both in the 
Lancaster Environment Centre, Lancaster University. The project will be in collaboration with Dr 
Lionel Dupuy (SCRI, Dundee) and represents an exceptional opportunity to receive training in 
both computational modelling and plant physiology/molecular genetics. 
 
The BBSRC studentships provide funding for 4 years support; UK candidates are eligible for full 
awards, covering the cost of tuition fees and stipend (currently £13000/annum), while EU 
candidates are eligible for tuition fees only. 
 
The deadline for applications is Thursday 26th February and interviews will take place in late 
March.  For further project information and information on how to apply please
