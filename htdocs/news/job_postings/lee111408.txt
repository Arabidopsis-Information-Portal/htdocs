The Lee lab is looking for a postdoctoral associate who will actively perform the research 
on gene regulatory programs for vascular patterning and root growth in Arabidopsis. The 
procambium/cambium is the stem cell population that controls the cell division and 
differentiation of plant vascular tissues.  The extent of vascular cell division and 
differentiation from the procambium/cambium determines diverse growth forms of 
vascular plants, such as trees, shrubs, and herbs.  
The main objectives of this project are 1) to investigate functions of procambium for 
vascular tissue patterning, proliferation, and size of root meristems and 2) to identify 
gene regulatory networks in the procambium and link them to developmental roles.  To 
address these goals, the downstream regulatory pathways and procambium functions led 
by transcription factors SHORT ROOT and PHABULOSA will be identified by employing 
systematic approaches that combine molecular genetics, genomics, and systems biology.  
This research project is supported by NSF for three years.
An applicant must have a Ph.D. with the expertise in developmental genetics and cell and 
molecular biology and have a strong record of scientific publications.  The experience in 
genome-wide expression analyses will be beneficial but not required.
To apply, send a brief statement of research interest (1 page), a CV with the names of 
three references to Ji-Young Lee (jl924@cornell.edu).  The application will be reviewed 
beginning on December 1, 2008 and the position will be open until it is filled.
