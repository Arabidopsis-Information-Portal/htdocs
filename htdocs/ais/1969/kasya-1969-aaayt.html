In previous papers a mutant form chlorina 80/2 was described which was
induced by gamma-rays of 60 Co (dose 80 kR) on dry seeds.  The
crossing of this form with race Enkheim shows monofactorial
segregation (KASYANENKO, 1967; KASYANENKO and NASYROV, 1968).
Detailed investigations fo this mutant have revealed that it is
heterozygous.  When grown in the greenhouse it segregates 2:1 - two
parts of large, yellow-green plants and one part of small yellow
plants with leaves early dying off. Silique analysis shows that in
large plants 25% of all embryos are of the embryo lethal type "vana".
The silique of small yellow plants contain only normal embryos
(KANYANENKO and USMANOV, 1968).  Thus it was established that the
described mutant chlorina 80/2 is heterozygous. The dominant
homozygotes are not viable and dye in an early embryonic stage.  This
gives 25% of vana lethals in siliques of large plants. The recessive
homozygotes are phenotypicaly small yellow plants with leaves early
dying off and normal embryos.  Heterozygotes are large, yellow-green
plants described earlier as chlorina 80/2.  Reciprocal crosses between
the heterozygote and the recessive homozygote were carried out and
their results support the above scheme.<p>
