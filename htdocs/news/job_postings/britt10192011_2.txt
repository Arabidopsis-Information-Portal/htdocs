3 year Postdoctoral Research Position

This project is focused on the development of new plant breeding
technologies through the manipulation of chromosome behavior. This
researcher will use Arabidopsis thaliana as a model to generate and test a
variety of modified centromeric proteins for effects on centromere function,
including roles in mitosis and meiosis. The resulting data will provide
insights into the relationship of protein structure to centromeric function
and may provide a new methodology for haploidization of a variety of crop
species.

The candidate should be familiar with cloning and in vitro mutagenesis
techniques and have an interest in chromosome biology. Skills in
cytogenetics, and/or protein biochemistry are also desirable. This project
will be performed at the Dept. of Plant Biology at the University of
California, Davis, under the supervision of Dr. Anne Britt as part of a
collaborative effort with the lab of Dr. Simon Chan. With over 100
plant-focused research groups and a strong program in general chromosome
biology, UC Davis provides an excellent environment for the study of
chromosome biology in plants. Davis is a small college town located in the
northern Central Valley of California. It is 20' from the state capitol
(Sacramento), and 1hr 20' from San Francisco.

 Applications should be submitted in electronic form, and should include a
CV and three letters of reference. Inquiries and applications should
include the subject line "Postdoctoral Position" and should be sent to:
