<h2>Inhibition of seed germination in Arabidopsis by coumarin and 2-thiouracil</h2><p>

	The inhibitory effect of 2-thiouracil (TU) on germination and the reversion of this effect by uracil (U) was described by KAHN (1966) for lettuce seeds and by SHIMENO and KINOSHITA (1963) for leaf mustard seeds.  The same is true for Arabidopsis seeds, race Dijon (harvested in June 1965 and stored at room conditions).  The seeds were sown in Petri-dishes on filter paper soaked with 20 ml of aqueous solutions of thiouracil, uracil, or a mixture of both. Germination proceeded in a 12 hour photoperiod at 25+/- 3*degrees*C, under 7,000 lux and was scored after 8 days.  The results summerized in the table indicate that already 5 x 10E-44M TU inhibited the germination entirely, but this effect could be reverted by 10E-3M uracil.<p>

	The inhibition of TU is reversible when the seeds treated with TU are transferred after 8 days to Petri-dishes with filter paper and distilled water.<p>
