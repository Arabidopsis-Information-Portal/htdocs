The storage of genetically defined material is essential to any
genetical research programme.  Plant seeds represent a convenient way
for such storage, however, germination frequencies decline at variable
rates upon prolonged storage at room temperature.<p>

The following report illustrates the application of freeze-storage of
A. thaliana and other plant seeds to overcome the decline of
viability.  The method is in no way new (see Sakai and Noshiro, 1975;
Lipman, 1934) and its application to Arabidopsis actually stems from
Dr. G. Redei (pers. comm. 1976)<p>

The procedure involves: (i) harvest of mature seeds and storage at
room temperature for 2 months, (ii) pooling of seeds in a plastic
capsule and rapid immersion of such in liquid nitrogen (for as long as
desired), (iii) storage in liquid nitrogen and (iv) rapid thawing by
immersion of the capsule in 37*degrees*C water.<p>

Viability of seeds from a range of plant species relative to control
seeds is as follows: A. thaliana col. wildtype (93%), Nicotiana
tabacum-Samsun (87%), Glycine max T202(80%), Oryza sativa-Starbonnet
(90%), Zea mays-Prior (100%), Tribolium alba (83%), Trifolium
subterraneum (97%).<p>

It should be noted that (a) no cryoprotectant was employed, (b)
regenerated plants appeared normal, and (c) seeds tested represented
different size classes, indicating that the method should have almost
universal application for seeds that can be air-dried prior to freeze
storage.<p>

The method for Arabidopsis seed storage has particular relevance to
research in our laboratory because of its application in the
maintenance of 'identical' seed material used for callus cell line
initiation. Rather than proceeding with a continual subculture regime,
maintaining highly variable callus material, it is our belief that
more reproducibility is achieved if the cell cultures always
represent, for example, the third subculture (2 week intervals) after
callus induction on a particular medium from a constant seed
reservoir.<p>

Experimental verification in regards to the reproducibility of
phytohormone induced plantlet regeneration from callus derived either
directly from seed as compared to cell lines maintained in continuous
culture has been obtained.<p>

It is hoped that our observations may reawaken some new interest and
application of seed cryopreservations.<p>
