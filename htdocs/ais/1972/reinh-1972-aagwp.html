IVANOV (1967) reported on the formation of additional generative
shoots after treatment of airdry seeds of Arabidopsis (race ENKHEIM)
with [60Co] gamma-rays (10-160 kR).  The percent of "multicaulous" plants
increased with the radiation dose to a maximum of 58,7% after exposure
to 110 kR.  The number of additional shoots per multicaulous plant was
very uniform in the whole dose range, i.e., 1.13-1.36.  IVANOV had no
explanation for this multicaulity-effect: "Our data offer no
conclusive indication as to the possible nature of such damage".<p>

In 1947 we observed a corresponding effect after 6 kR of X-rays on 38
h presoaked seeds of race ENKHEIM.  Nearly 100% of the X1-plants had
3-5 generative shoots coming out of the axils of the rosette leaf.  It
is well known, that the initials in the main shoot apex are very
radiosensitive and will, therefore, be destroyed by relatively low
doses.  Consequently the apical dominance decreases.  Thus the
axillary buds, which are normally dormant, are able to grow.<p>

(When a lot of seeds from a single plant is needed, the main stem of
the inflourescence may be cut off for the same purpose after
seed-harvest.  Then the axillary buds of the uppermost rosette leaves
are also sprouting in a basipetally direction, producing again many
seeds.)<p>

This explanation holds also true for the data of IVANOV: The higher
the radiation dose was, the more multicaulous plants were observed;
the maximum and the decrease after 110 kR are an expression of the
lethality of the embryos irradiated with doses higher than kR.  On the
other side, the number of additional shoots is independent of the dose
range and only determined by the physiological state and structure of
the shoot apex.  Thus I like to explain the discrepancy in the nunber
of shoots per multicaulous plant (IVANOV: 1.13-1.36 REINYOLS: 3-5)
with the different number of initial cells of the shoot apex in airdry
and presoaked seeds (embryos).<p>

In many animals the vegetative and generative cells are separated
during the first steps of development; in plants the "Keimbahn" is not
so early determined.  We are going to investigate the number of the
initial cells of the embryonic shoot apex by testing conformity and
discrimination of X-ray mutations in the different shoots of a
multicaulous plant obtained by cutting off the main influorescence
stem.<p>
