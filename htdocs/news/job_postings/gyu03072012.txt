*Two PhD positions* are available in the department of Molecular Ecology 
(Director: Prof. Ian T. Baldwin) at MPI for chemical ecology. 

The project, ClockworkGreen is focused on the ecological roles of the 
circadian clock in plants and is funded by an ERC advanced grant 
(http://erc.europa.eu/advanced-grants). Circadian rhythms of plants 
(such as flower opening/closing, leaf movement, daily growth) have long 
been of interest to humans given their importance to agricultural 
productivity. Recently, molecular biologists have identified the core 
clock components of plants and characterized their molecular mechanisms. 
In this project, we will silence core components of the clock to create 
arrhythmic plants in a wild tobacco, Nicotiana attenuata, which has been 
our ecological model for the study of genes that are required for 
survival in nature. We will be planting these arrhythmic plants into the 
plant's native habitat in the Great Basin Desert in the US and using 
genomics, proteomics, metabolomics and bioinformatics to understand how 
circadian rhythms alter plant performance in nature. We are looking for 
enthusiastic PhD students with strong interests in this project and 
plant ecology. Applicant should have a strong background in basic 
molecular biology or biochemistry and an interest in applying these 
skills to field work. Please send your application including CV, 
statement of research interests, names and e-mail addresses of 2
