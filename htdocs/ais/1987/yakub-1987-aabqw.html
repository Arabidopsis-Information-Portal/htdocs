ATPases of chloroplasts represent the group of enzymes which carry out
ATP hydrolysis with formation of ADP and inorganic phosphat.
Chloroplasts have usually comparatively low ATPase activity. The
activity can be increased by using special treatments. For some
ATPases activating light is necessary. There are two types of ATPase:
light-dependent and light-triggered. It is known that the
conformational state of the enzyme molecule is changed under the
influence of light which is connected with the appearance of ATPase
activity (Petrack et al., 1965).<p>

Reversible ATPase (E.C. 3.6.1.4) of chloroplasts which takes part in
photophosphorylation is a complex compound of lipid protein. It
consists of the lipoproteid hydrophobic component CF O and the protein
component CF 1. The state of membrane lipids influences greatly the
activity of the complex.<p>

There are some data in literature about the modification of membrane
lipids which is under the influence of anesthetics. For example,
aliphatic alcohols were successfully used in Lenaz' laboratory for the
research of lipid-protein interaction in mitochondria membranes
because of the activity of coupling factor (Lenaz et al., 1978). The
effect of monatomic alcohols on the solubilized CF 1 is given in
Malyan's research (Malyan, 1980). But there are no data on the effect
of alcohols on the ATPase activity of CF 1 in the membrane bound
state.<p>

We have studied earlier the Mg-dependent ATPase activity of
Arabidopsis chloroplasts incubated in the dark (Kononenko and
Yakubowa, 1985). This work contains some results of light dependent
ATPase of chloroplasts and the effect of ethanol on this enzyme
activity.<p>

We used Arabidopsis thaliana - the original wild type Enkheim and its
highly productive mutant triplex. Morphological pecularities of the
investigated objects have been already described (Yakuobowa et al.,
1980).<p>

Chloroplasts were isolated by Fry's method (Fry, 1970), chlorophyll
was determined by the Arnon method (Arnon, 1949). The enzyme activity
was evaluated by the quantity of hydrolysing ATP per unit of time. For
the determination of ATPase activity 1.5ml of reactionary medium was
used containing tris-HC1-buffer (pH 7.8) - 9 microM, ATP - 5 microM,
MgC1 2 - 5 micro M, PMS (phenasinmetasulphate)- 0.1 M, and C 2 H 5 OH
- 20%. Reaction was held at light of different periods of time at the
temperature of 37*degrees*C.<p>

The experiment showed that the initial Mg-ATPase activity of the wild
type chloroplasts is 76 times more than ATPase activity of mutant
triplex after 10 min of incubation (Table 1).<p>

Table 1: Light-dependent Mg-ATPase activity of A. thaliana
chloroplasts, wild type Enkheim and mutant triplex (micro M P i/mg of
chlorophyll per hour).<p>

It is known that the spontaneous mutant triplex is characterized by
relatively high rates of non cyclic electron transport, high intensity
of photophosphorylation per chloroplast and cell and by increasing the
number of pods (Yakubowa et al. 1980). According to the results
obtained, the relatively low ATPase activity of the mutant
chloroplasts can be explained either by fast drawing in of inorganic
phosphate which is the product of ATPase reaction in the process of
photophosphorylation. Consequently it isn't accumulated in increasing
quantity or by functioning of a more effective system of ATP
translocation and its drawing in during the process of plant
metabolism of mutant triplex chloroplasts.<p>

Addition of ethanol to the reaction media accelerate the rate of ATP
hydrolysis in both variants. But under the influence of ethanol the
ATPase activity of wild type chloroplasts was changed insignificantly
and at the same time it increased 4 times in mutant chloroplasts.<p>

Perhaps these differences can be explained by the specific
pecularities of the membrane organization of the photosynthetic
apparatus in the wild type Enkheim and the mutant triplex.<p>
