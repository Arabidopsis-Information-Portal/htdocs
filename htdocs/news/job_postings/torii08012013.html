<p>Postdoctoral positions are available for non-Japanese nationals to study
    the mechanism of plant development using synthetic, systems and
    cross-disciplinary approaches fusing catalysis organic chemistry, peptide
    biochemistry, and plant chemical genetics. Specific projects include:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Rational design of plant peptides, ligand-receptor pairs, as well
        as their structural/functional analysis to manipulate and hijack signal
        transduction pathways regulating plant development</li>

    <li>Chemical-genetic screen to identify novel bioactive small molecules
        and their targets</li>

    <li>Development of new fluorescent dyes and biosensors to study signal
        transduction in plants</li>
</ol>
<p>Institute of Transformative Biomolecules (ITbM) is a newly founded
    research institute as a part of the World Premier International Research
    Center Initiative (WPI) by the Japanese government to revolutionize and
    internationalize Japanese research environment. English will be used as a
    standard language in ITbM.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of ITbM is to develop novel, key molecules to control
    biological functions and productivity of animal/plant crops; and to innovate
    bio-imaging. The most unique feature of ITbM is a complete unity of organic
    synthetic chemists, plant and animal biologists, and theoretical chemists,
    who share laboratory benches and office desks, to facilitate
    interdisciplinary research. The institute has a state-of-art imaging center,
    mass-spectrometry and NMR center, and chemical-library screening center to
    facilitate rapid research progress.</p>
<p>A candidate must have a strong research publication record (as
    exemplified by the first-authored manuscripts) and be proficient in
    biochemistry, structural biology, chemical genetics, and/or live imaging
    techniques at tissue-, cellular- or subcellular levels. Solid backgrounds in
    basic molecular biology, chemical synthesis and/or plant biology are highly
    desirable.</p>
<p>Due to highly interdisciplinary nature of the institute, the candidate
    must have strong communication skills, be highly active and interactive
    while being independent, and willing to take challenges to work with
    scientists from different fields.</p>
<p>The successful candidates will work in the lab with a mixture of
    biologists and chemist under Dr. Keiko Torii (PI), who will be in Nagoya
    University occasionally as a Oversea Investigator. The candidates will be
    closely supervised by Dr. Naoyuki Uchida (Co-PI), who is a full-time faulty
    at the ITbM.</p>
<p>Employment condition:</p>
<p>Salary: JPN 4.2 M (approx..US$ 43k) per year. (Includes all expenses;
    e.g. taxes, health insurance, daily commuting expenses) Term: annually
    renewed based on the performance; up to three years. Start date: January
    2014 or negotiable</p>
<p>The successful candidate will be encouraged to apply for independent
    fellowships to gain independent programs for his/her future career path.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Nagoya is the third largest metropolitan area in Japan and a hub
    for the Central Japan, with easy access to Japan’s major cities (Tokyo,
    Kyoto, and Osaka) by high-speed bullet train. Nagoya is rich in history and
    culture. The Nagoya University campus is situated in a beautiful, protected
    forest region (Higashiyama area).</p>
