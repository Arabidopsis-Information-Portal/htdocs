lambda SEP6 PHAGE DNA MAXIPREP

From Noel Ellis (Department of Applied Genetics, The John Innes 
Centre for Plant Science Research, Colney Lane, Norwich, NR4 7UH, 
England) & Steve Scofield (The Sainsbury Laboratory, The John Innes 
Centre for Plant Science Research), as used by Jonathan Clarke 
(Department of Molecular Genetics, The Cambridge Laboratory, The 
John Innes Centre for Plant Science Research).

*  The prep uses liquid lysates as starting material.  The higher the titre 
the better the results.  Most lambda phage grow best in liquid cultures 
started at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 (1 phage/100 cells).  
The E. coli strains used as hosts successfully are K802, K803, and 
C600.

1.  LIQUID LYSATE
  (i) Warm 100 ml of LB + 10mM MgSO4 to 37oC.
  (ii) Mix 400 ul of cells with 1.2 x 105pfu in a 250 ml flask.  Adsorb at 
37oC for 20 min.
 *  Cells are grown o/n at 37oC in 10 ml of LB + 0.2% Maltose.  A 
stationary culture is spun down  at 4000 rpm for 10 min and the cells are 
resuspended in 4 ml of 10 mM MgSO4.

2.  DNA PREP
  (iii) Pour in the prewarmed LB and shake overnight at 37oC.
  (iv) Add 200 ul of chloroform, 4 g NaCl, and 100 ul of 1 mgml-1 RNAse & 
DNAse, incubate at r.t. for 1 h.
  (v) Spin down the cell debris at 8,000rpm for 10 min to give a hard 
pellet.
  (vi) Add 10 g PEG 6000 to the supernatant in a fresh centrifuge bottle 
and leave at 4oC for at least 1 h after the PEG has dissolved (or o/n).
  (vii) Spin down the phage pellet at 8,000rpm for 10 min.
  (viii) Redissolve the phage pellet in 4 ml SM phage buffer (4 h to o/n at 
4oC).  Transfer the phage suspension to an Oak Ridge tube.
  (ix) Mix the phage suspension with an equal volume of chloroform to 
extract the PEG, spin at 4,000rpm for 10 min at r.t. to separate the 
phases.
  (x) Make to 50 mM in EDTA, and add 100 ugml-1 proteinase K, and 
incubate for 1-2 h at 55oC.
  (xi) Add an equal volume of phenol, mix and spin at 8,000rpm for 10 min 
at 4oC.
  (xii) Remove the aqueous phase and add 1/10 vol of 3M sodium 
acetate and 2 vol of absolute ethanol (-20oC), mix and incubate at -20oC 
for 30 min.
  (xiii) Repeat the phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation.  Rinse the 
pellet with 80% ethanol, dry under vacuum and resuspend the pellet in 
100 ul TE.
  (xiv) Run DNA sample over a sepharose CL-6B spin column at 3000rpm
