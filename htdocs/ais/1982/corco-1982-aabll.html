We reported (Corcos, 1981) that the mutagenic agent diethyl sulfate
(DES) at the dose of 0.5 ml/100 cc had not affected the germination of
M 1 Arabidopsis plants, but had seriously affected the germination of
M 2 plants. In view of these results, we decreased the concentration
of DES to 0.15 ml/100 cc.<p>

The results of lowering the concentration are given in Table 1.<p>

Table 1: Germination results of M 2 plants<p>

The average germination percentage among the M 2 plants, progeny of
plants that were treated with DES at the dose of 0.15 ml/100 cc was
32%. The average germination percentage among the M 2 plants, progeny
of plants that were reated with 0.5 ml/100 cc, was 44% (Corcos, 1981).
Therefore, lowering the concentration of DES to 0.15 ml/100 cc did not
improve the germination of M 2 Arabidopsis plants.<p>
