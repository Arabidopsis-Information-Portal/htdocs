Dry Arabidopsis seeds were treated with a range of doses of gamma-rays
and fast neutrons, and with EMS.  The M1 plants were screened for male
sterility; 113 plants or shoots without any normally developing
siliques were retained for examination under the binocular and for
crossing with unirradiated plants.<p>

Microscopically, four types of male sterility were found: (a) thecae
filled with pollen, but not dehiscent and ultimately shriveling (91
cases); (b) thecae of normal appearance but with only few pollen
grains; shriveling at a later stage without dehiscence (20 cases); (c)
thecae smaller, devoid of pollen and not dehiscent (1 case); (d)
thecae shriveling at a very early stage (1 case).  In all plants, the
filaments and connective tissue of the anthers were normal.<p>

As a prliminary to crossing studies the degree of successful
emasculation was determined; 200 flowers on control plants were
emasculated and isolated without polination.  Fourteen flowers (7%)
produced a fertile silique.  In these cases the emasculation was
assumed to have failed; the confidence limits for this percentage were
0 and 12% respectively (P = 0.05).<p>

Male sterile M1 plants were rather easily detected by absence of
normal siliques, but also by the fact that a large proportion of the
male sterile individuals possessed weak thin stems (50 - 80%,
dependent on radiation dose); this weakness is probably chiefly the
result rather than the cause of the sterility.  The aberrant growth
habit of the plants was itself not prohibitive to normal fruit
development, as crossing with normal pollen led to normal siliques.
There was no relation between sterility in the M1 and the date of
flowering. The length of the longest leaf at the beginning of anthesis
was slightly greater in the male sterile plants than in the fertile
plants; the differences were 1.6% in the neutron irradiated plants,
8.7% after gamma-rays and 7.5% after EMS; however, none of these
differences were significant.<p>

The occurrence of male sterility was verified by using anthers of the
suspected plants for pollinating emasculated control flowers, 10-15
such pollinations were carried out per suspected plant; 97 plants were
confirmed to be male sterile. There was only one doubtful case,
yielding 2 siliques (more than the 12% allowed for errors in
castration); it was discarded. The table shows that the incidence of
male sterility increased with dose; on the basis of comparable
survival rate (lowest doses of both types of radiation approximately
equivalent) there was no reliable difference between fast neutrons and
gamma-rays; the EMS treatment produced a much lower percentage of male
sterile plants.<p>

Table : Male sterility after irradiation and EMS<p>

Of each male sterile plant, 10-15 flowers were subsequently crossed
with pollen from control plants; all M1 plants proved to be fertile,
indicating that no female sterility had occurred.  Only two families
(F1) segregated for very slight fertility (table); one, from 10 krad
of fast neutrons, segregated 16 fertile: 14 slightly fertile, while
the other, from 50 krad of gamma-rays, segregated 9 : 10.  Although
several alternative explanations are possible and will have to be
tested, these cases are tentatively thought to represent intermediary
inheritance of a mutated gene for weak fertility or sterility the
slightly fertile plants being heterozygous; the sterility of the
mother plants (M1) may have been caused by additional physiological
effects.  Furthermore, 3 F1 families segregated 3 fertile : 1 fully
sterile; these may be cases of recessive mutations in which the M1
plants have been selfed accidentally after unsuccessful emasculation.
Alternatively, this segregation might have been caused by a chimeric
situation for plasmatic male sterility and physiological or
chromosomal male sterility in the flowering M1 shoot.  This will be
further tested in the F2. There were no fully sterile F1 families,
which shows that, except for the possibility just mentioned, no
plasmatic male sterility had been induced; this agrees with J.H.  van
der VEEN (personal communication) who so far failed to find plasmatic
male sterility after EMS treatment. The selfed progenies of all F1
families will be tested for segregation of infertility, to allow a
distinction between genetic male sterility and physiological radiation
effects in the M1; in the first case, the offspring of 50% of the
plants in each F1 family will contain male sterile individuals, while
in the latter case all progenies will be (almost) fully fertile on
selfing. Finally, the selfed seed of several hundred fertile M1 plants
had also been harvested and will be screened for segregation of
genetic male sterility.<p>
