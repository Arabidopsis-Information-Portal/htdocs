	<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, grown in aseptic culture on
chemically defined agar media, is an ideal tool for mineral nutrition
research.  A great diversity of races and mutant types is available
for study, and the media is easily altered to produce any complete or
partial mineral deficiency desired.<p>


	In a class experiment, "Estland" wild type was grown under 24
hour photoperiod in a media in which NaNO3 replaced KNO3.  The
composition of this media per plant is as follows:<p>

	Every two days ten plants grown in the potassium deficient
media and ten control plants were harvested, and the fresh and dry
weight was obtained.  At the final harvest, the dry plant material was
bulked and ashed.  The ask was dissolved in 5% HCl, and the potassium
content determined with a BECKMAN flame spectrophotometer at 767
millimicrons with reference to a standard curve.  Germination rate,
flowering time, and the visible appearance of the plants was also
noted.<p>

	95% of the seeds sown on the potassium free media germinated,
but the potassium deficient plants grew more slowly than the controls
(Fig.  1).  The floral meristem elongated only about 1 cm, the older
rosette leaves died before flowering, and all leaves had a red color.
The results of the photometric analysis are:<p>

	However, these severe visible and chemical symptoms of
potassium deficiency are strongly contrasted by the normal life cycle
of the stressed plants. The experimental plants had a mean flowering
time of 22 days after sowing, only one day later than the control.<p>


	The only source of potassium was that provided by the seed and
contamination in the media, which was evidently limited to very low
levels.  Despite such a severe environmental stress, and the severe
restriction on growth imposed by this, the potassium deficient plants
were reserved; all flowered producing small pods.  From these twenty
plants, however, only two seeds were obtained.<p>
