	Reverse-mutation frequency may be used as one way of characterizing mutants.  All our mutants have been obtained after EMS treatment. Since there are indications that EMS preferably causes GC - AT transitions (KRIEG, 1963), nitrous acid and hydroxylamine would be suitable mutagens.  MULLER (1965), however, states that the latter two compounds do not give mutants in Arabidopsis, which results were confirmed in our own experiments on forward mutations.  Since EMS can also give AT - GC transitions (KRIEG, l.c.), though at much lower frequency, reverse-mutation studies were initiated with different py mutants, using this compound.<p>

	In preliminary experiments about 10.000 seeds per mutant were treated with 12.5 mM EMS at 24*degrees*C for 24 h, and sown on mineral medium.  A reverse mutation will give rise to a plant of chimerical structure, part of which is able of synthesizing thiamine.  Due to diffusion of the latter substance, no clearcut sectors can be expected.  A number of green plants were obtained, some of them showing small diffuse yellow sectors. To stimulate seedling growth, which possibly may help mutated sectors in synthesizing sufficient thiamine to sustain development of the whole plant, besides completely mineral substrates also media containing small (0.003 - 0.006 mg/l) amounts of thiamine were used.<p>

	Our results up to now do not allow us to give quantitative data, but we can state that from one line, py-22, we obtained two wild-type plants, the offspring of which was analyzed. The chimerical structure of these two plants could be established without doubt. The experiments are being continued.<p>
