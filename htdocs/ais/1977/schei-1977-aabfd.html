Arabidopsis thaliana is an organism, which is conditioning on its
small nuclear volume and its low chromosome number, of special
suitability for radiation experiments, because its strong resistance
is combined with a high mutability.  Therefore, seeds of Arabidopsis
were subjects of the Biostack expriments in Apollo 16 and 17 and in
Apollo-Soyuz, where the biological effects of cosmic rays, especially
HZE-particles, were studied.<p>

The energy loss of these particles is restricted to a very small range
along the track. The special layering of biological and physical foils
enables the identification of a biological subject which has been hit
by a particle.  For Arabidopsis seeds special measure and computer
programs were designed, which allowed the determination of the tissue
of a certain seed which has been hit by a particle.<p>

In order to correlate the latent tracks proved by etching the physical
detector in a NaOh-solution (2N), and the seeds, it is indispensable,
that the seeds are in fixed contact with the detector (embedding
medium: polyvinylalcohol (PVA)).  After the embedding procedure with
PVA germination deficiencies have been found in earlier experiments.<p>

During the accelerator-experiment J8 (radiation with C12-Ions at the
Bevatron in Berkeley, California) it becomes evident, that it is of
high importance, to notice the dynamics of germination besides the
germination rate in radiation experiments. While with respect to the
germination rates no differences were found between hit seeds and the
control, obviously differences were found in the dynamics of
germination. A gradation was found from hit seeds over seeds, where
particles stoped narrowly in front of the seeds, and control seeds
embedded in the irradiated foil, which were not hit, to the control
seeds of an unirradiated foil.  But these deviations between the
control of the irradiated and the unirradiated foil can also be caused
by the embedding procedure; it was found, that seeds of two biological
foils, embedded with the same PVA-solution, showed different
frequencies.<p>

With respect to 10 characters of growth, 10 of differentiation and 8
of the develoment of the plants, no differences were found between
irrradiated hit seeds and control seeds; moreover, no increase of the
frequency of the spontaneous mutations tested with the embryo-test
(Muller, 1963) was observed.  However, this could not be expected,
since no particle had crossed the cells of the germ line in the seeds,
which were studied by the computer program.<p>

Therefore, other substances were tested for their embedding
suitability.  Preliminary studies proved the following 4 substances:<p>

Luviskol VA 64 (10 p.c. in ethanol)
Kollidon         "  "    "   "
Luviskol VA 37 I (1:2 with ethanol)
Silicon-rosin-solution (1:7,5 with benzene)<p>

Very slight deviations of the germination dynamics were found between
embedded seeds and the control, respectively. The further development
of the seedlings and the rate of spontaneous mutations were not
changed.<p>

Since they are easier to use and since their influence on the seed
germination and development is minimal<p>

Luviskol VA 64 (10 p.c. in ethanol) and
Kollidon        "   "   "   "<p>

are most convenient for future Biostack- and accelerator experiments.<p>
