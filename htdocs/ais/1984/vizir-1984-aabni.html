INTRODUCTION<p>

The elimination of possible artefacts in studies of recombinogenesis
constitutes a serious problem. Such defects are thought to be due to
noncontrolled factors (Butler, 1977).<p>

Estimation of the variability of recombination fequency is a
prerequisite for sample size optimization in F 1 and F 2 generations
to eliminate noncontrolled factor effects. This article deals with the
rf variability on chromosome 2 of Arabidopsis thaliana.<p>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<p>

The F1 fresh harvested seeds from as'er x an'ap'ch-c (a), as'hy x
py'gl'an'cer'er (b) and py'gl'an'cer'er x as'hy (c) crosses were used
in our tests. For the phenotypes of marker genes see Koornneef's
(1983) gene mapping paper. The breeding procedure and seed harvesting
were done simultaneously for groups (b) and (c), and separately for
group (a). Sampling of F 2 seeds from each F 1 plant was random and
corresponded to the number of seeds in 4 to 6 siliquaes.<p>

Seeds were sown on Petri dishes containing solution-soaked (KNO 3,
0.1%) filter paper and germinated following the synchronization
technique (Petrov et al., 1982). Plants were grown in soil culture
under continuous fluorescent light (E = 7000 lux) at 22 to
25*degrees*C.<p>

Environmental conditions for various F 2 populations (Table 1) were
different: (I) harvested seeds were kept under room conditions and
sown after two weeks, (II) harvested seeds were kept under greenhouse
conditions (high levels of temperature and humidity) and sown after
about a month; for the normal development of py-/py- genotypes, F2
plants were sprayed with thiamine HC1 (5 mg/1) every day.<p>

Standard errors for rf values of individual families as well as pooled
samples over the families were estimated using the formula (1)
(Bailey, 1961), and formula (2) for weighted pooled values (Kendall
and Stuart, 1966; Urbakh, 1964).<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

Comparisons of rf values by t-test showed the absence of differences
among families as well as between F 1 reciprocal variants.<p>

The differences between rf standard errors estimated by formulas (1)
and (2) were negligible (Table 1). This indicated a low level of
nonctontrolled factor effects in our experiments.<p>

Table 1: Recombination values and their errors for individual F 1
plants.<p>

The deviation from the 3:1 ratio towards an increase of mutant plant
number (1.93 for as marker, 2.87 for er marker) in the third family,
probably, also accounted for a considerable degree of deviation in the
sum value (2.70 for as marker, 2.87 for er marker). This is due not
only to the selective elimination of F2 plants, since the observed
death rate was low (Table 1). However, it can be assumed that this
result from selection of wild type gametes (Zhuchenko, 1980).<p>

The correlation between death rate and rf in F 2 conditions (II) is
-0.746, though it should be verified for a larger F 2 population size.
Yet, the deviation from the 3:1 ratio towards an increase in dominant
plant number of individual F 2 families points to inverse correlation.<p>

The t-test comparisons of our rf values for as'er and as'hy segments
with those of Koornneef (1983), weighted by us using formula (2)
showed the absence of differences (16.20 +/- 1.39 and 18.07 +/- 1.96
for as'er segment, 13,75 +/- 1.90 and 15.83 +/- 1.14 for the as'hy
segment, respectively).<p>

CONCLUSION<p>

1. Variability of rf among F 1 plants can be attributed to statistical
reasons.<p>

2. The correlation between the rf values and F 2 viability is weak
although is stronger for individual F 2 families.<p>

3. The effet of reciprocal crossing on the rf values in the as'hy
region is absent.<p>

4. The rf value is fairly stable under growth conditions close to
optimum.<p>

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS<p>

The author wishes to thank Professor A.A. Zhuchenko and Dr. A.B. Korol
for the attention given to this work, Dr. M. Koornneef for sending a
large collection of marker lines, some of which (as'hy and
py'gl'an'cer'er) we used in this study, Dr. S.I. Yanushkevich, Moscow
State University, for the supplied seeds of marker lines, some of
which (as'er and an'ap'ch-c) we used also in our experiments.<p>
