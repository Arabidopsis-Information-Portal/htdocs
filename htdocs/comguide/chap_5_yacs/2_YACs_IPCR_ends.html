1.  MAKING SPHEROPLASTS
  (i)  Harvest cells from 25 ml SD-ura-trp cultures (grown at 30oC for 2 d, 
shaken in 125 or 250 ml flasks) by centrifugation at 3,000rpm for 2 min.
  (ii) Wash cells with 1 ml 1M Sorbitol, spin down in microcentrifuge tube.  
(The packed volume of cells should be approximately 50 ml.)
  (iii)  Resuspend cells in 300 ul SCEM (1M Sorbitol, 0.1M Sodium Citrate 
pH 5.8, 10mM EDTA and 30mM beta&#173;Mercaptoethanol).
  (iv) Add 30 ul of 100 mgml-1 Novozyme 234 (Novo Enzyme Products) 
in SCE.  (Filter sterilise before use).
  (v) Incubate at r.t. for 1 h.

2. CHROMOSOME PREPARATION
  (i) Prepare spheroplasts as above.
  (ii) Spin down at low speed for 5 sec.
  (iii) Resuspend in 1M Sorbitol to 100 ul total volume.
  (iv) Add 100 ul 1% InCert agarose (F.M.C.) made up in 1M Sorbitol and 
containing 2mM Aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA), at 50oC, mix gently and 
pipette into 100 ul gel plug moulds, place on ice for 5 min to set.
  (v) Place the blocks into 1 ml of 0.5 mgml-1 Proteinase K in 100mM 
EDTA pH 8, 1% Sarkosyl, 1mM ATA and incubate at 50oC for at least 4 
h.
  (vi) Exchange buffer for 1 ml of fresh 0.5 mgml-1 Proteinase K  in 
100mM EDTA pH 8, 1% Sarkosyl and incubate overnight at 50oC.
  (vii) Wash blocks 4 x 30 min with 1 ml TE + 1mM Phenylmethylsulphonyl 
fluoride (PMSF), 4 x 30 min with TE and 2 x 30 min with 0.5 x TBE, in all 
cases mix continuously while washing.  Store blocks at 4oC.

3.  IPCR OF YAC ENDS
(DNA preparation based on E. Heard, et al., N.A.R. 17, 5861, 1989.)
  (i) Prepare spheroplasts as above.
  (ii) Spin down at low speed for 5 sec.
  (iii) Resuspend in 400 ul TE.SDS (75mM Tris pH 7.5, 40mM EDTA, 
0.4% SDS), incubate at 65oC for 20 min.
  (iv) Cool on ice, add 100 ul of 5M KAc, incubate on ice 15 min.
  (v) Spin down debris, 10 min.
  (vi) Transfer supernatant to fresh tube, add 2 vol of ethanol, place on 
ice for 5 min.
  (vii) Collect precipitate by centrifugation for 5 min, wash pellet with 70% 
ethanol and (without drying) dissolve in 50 ul TE overnight.
  (viii) Add 110 ul H2O, 40 ul Cuts-all and digest with 10 U Alu I  at 37oC 
for 2 h.
  (ix) Add 0.1 vol 3M NaAc and extract with phenol, phenol-chloroform 
and chloroform.  Add 2 vol of ethanol, place on ice for 5 min.
  (x) Collect precipitate by centrifugation and (without drying) dissolve in 
50 ul of TE (4oC for 2 h then gentle pipetting).
  (xi) Add 310 ul H2O, 40 ul 10 x ligation mix and 1 ul T4 DNA ligase 
(N.E.B.).  Incubate at 4oC for 2 d.
  (xii) Heat to 65oC for 10 min, add 0.1 vol 3M NaAc and 2.5 vol ethanol.  
Place on ice for 30 min.
  (xiii) Collect precipitate by centrifugation, wash with 70% ethanol and 
(without drying) dissolve in 50 ul TE (4oC for 2 h then gentle pipetting).
  (xiv) Warm to r.t., add 50 ul 1 % InCert agarose made up in TE (at 50oC).  
Mix well and pipette into 100 ul gel plug mould, place on ice for 10 min to 
set.
  (xv) Place block in 15 ml screw capped centrifege tube and wash (2 x 15 
min) with 14 ml 0.01 x TE with continuous inversion.
  (xvi) Place block in a microcentrifuge tube, remove all excess liquid and 
store at 4oC as necessary.
  (xvii) Melt agarose at 65oC for 5 min.  Add 30 ul aliquots to 3 tubes, 
each containing 130 ul H2O and 40 ul Cuts-all, prewarmed to 37oC.  To 
one tube add 10 U Nhe I (to linearise left YAC end circles), to the second 
add 10 U Ssp I (to linearise right YAC end circles) and incubate both at 
37oC for 2 h.
  (xviii) To each of the 3 tubes add 0.1 vol 3M NaAc and extract with 
phenol, phenol-chloroform and chloroform.  Add 2.5 vol ethanol and 
place at -20oC o/n.
  (xix) Collect precipitate by centrifugation and dissolve each in 50 ul 0.01 
x TE.  Store at -20oC.
  (xx) Set up PCR reaction: 60 ul H2O, 10 ul 10 x buffer (10 x =100mM 
Tris&#173;HCl pH 8.3, 500mM KCl, 20mM MgCl2, 0.1% Gelatin; autoclave, 
then add Tween 20 to 0.05% and NP40 to 0.05%), 16 ul dNTP mix 
(1.25mM each nucleotide), 2 ul of each of 2 primers (each 20uM), 10 ul 
DNA solution.  Mix well then add 2.5 U Taq DNA polymerase, mix and 
overlay with mineral oil.
  (xxi)  Run 35 cycles of 1 min at 94oC, 1 min at 60oC and 2 min at 72oC.  
Finish with an additional 10 min incubation at 72oC.
  (xxii) Analyse by electrophoresis of 5 ul of mix through a 2% agarose 
gel.  Transfer the remainder (excluding oil) to a fresh tube, add 0.1 vol 
3M NaAc and 2.5 vol ethanol, place on ice for 1 h to precipitate.
