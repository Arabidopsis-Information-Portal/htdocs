Vol 01S: <h2>The Mutagenic Activity of Nitrosoamides with Methyl and Ethyl Groups</h2><p>

T. GICHNER<p>

In this communication a comparison of the mutagenic activity of 4
nitrosoamides is reported: 1-methyl-3-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidine (MNG),
1- ethyl-3-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidine (ENG), 1-methyl-1-nitrosourea (MU)
and 1-ethyl-1-nitrosourea (EU. Two of these nitrosoamides have a
methyl group (MNG, MU), two have an ethyl group (ENG, EU). The
comparison of the mutagenic effects of these 2 types of nitrosoamides
was made mainly in account of their unclear mode of action. The
diazoalkane hypothesis (DRUCKREY et al, 1961, MARQUARDT et al, 1964)
explains the cytological and genetic effects of nitrosoamides by their
capability of releasing diazoalkanes, e.g., diazomethane etc. The
diazoalkanes are alkylating agents and as a result of the alkylating
mechanism the nitrosoamides are effective.  Some results, however, are
not, in favour of this hypothesis.  It has been proved both in
Arabidopsis for gene mutation (VELEMINSKY et al.  1964) and in Vicia
for chromosome aberration (MICHAELIS et al., 1965) that the mutagenic
activity of methyl and ethyl nitrosourea is decreased by the presence
of a respiratory inhibitor sodium azide and in anaerobic conditions.
These results were rather surprising since according to KIHLMAN (1961)
the effect of alkylating agents should not be influenced by an
inhibition of oxification. The various interpretations of these
results have been discussed elsewhere (VELEMINSKY et al, 1965). One of
the possibilities, supported also by MANDELL and GREENBERG (1960) and
by MICHAELIS et al., (1965), is that these substances do not act via
alkylation. High differences, however, in the mutagenic activity of
nitrosoamides with a methyl and an ethyl group, would, according to
our opinion, be in favour of the diazoalkane hypothesis. Especially,
as in other mutagens, definitely known to exert their mutagenicity via
alkylation, e.g., ethyl and methyl methanesulphonate and diethyl and
dimethyl sulphate, there is a high difference between the methyl and
the ethyl group, mainly when mutation effectivness is concerned.<p>

Methods: For all the experiments, seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana, race
Dijon were used. Time of treatment was 18 hrs, temperature
24*degrees*C, after the treatment seeds were washed for 6 hrs. in
distilled water. In each combination 3 siliques from 200-300 plants,
mostly in 2 repetitions, were analysed. The frequency of lethal and
chlorophyll mutants was scored according to the method of MULLER
(1963).  The mutation frequency was expressed by the percentage of M2
mutants.  The effect of nitrosoamides was compared with the effect of
the well known ethyl methanesulphonate (EMS).<p>

Results and discussion: Figure 1 represents the relation between the
frequency of induced M2 mutants and the concentration of tested
mutagens. As the range of tested concentrations is very large (0.075
to 15 mM), the values are expressed against a logarithmic lot.  With
increasing mutagen-concentration, there is a linear increase of the
frequency of M2 mutants for all tested nitrosoamides and the EMS.  The
concentration of mutagens, needed to induce mutations, however, differ
strikingly. Compounds, containing a methyl group (MU, MNG) are in the
range of lower concentrations, with the ethyl group (ENG, EU, EMS) in
the range of higher concentrations.<p>

A question arises of how to compare the mutagenic activity of
different chemomutagens. The highest reached frequency of segregating
plants or siliques is not suitable for this purpose, as by high
concentrations all tested compounds induce nearly 100% of segregating
plants or siliques. The same is true for the frequency of M2 mutants,
as high concentrations induce up to about 50% of M2 mutants and then
this value, even with increasing concentrations, does not change
significantly.<p>

mutants (mc; logarithmic plot)<p>

KONZAK et al. (1964) used 2 values for expressing the mutation
activity, which seem very useful and which have also been used in our
work: 1) mutation effectiveness and 2) mutation efficiency. The
mutation effectiveness expresses the relation of the mutation
frequency (M2 mutants) to the concentration used. It is calculated by
dividing the frequency of M2 mutants by the used concentration in mM.
The mutation effectiveness is a value important for understanding the
mode of action of the individual mutagens, but for the actual
induction of mutation much more important is the mutation efficiency,
expressing the relation of the frequency of the induced mutations to
the biological damage caused by the mutagen. This biological damage
can be of diverse character, e.g., lethality, decreased survival,
sterility. Since for the induction of mutations the value of sterility
is very important, we expressed the mutation efficiency by dividing
the frequency of M2 mutants with the value of M1 sterility.<p>

For the comparison of the tested compounds we have chosen the values
of mutation effectiveness and efficiency corresponding to 20% of
induced M2 mutants. All the values were then recalculated to the
values of EMS (Table 1). If the value of mutation effectiveness for
EMS is equivalent to 1, the value for MNG is about 100.<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol01S/vol01S-pg202-tab1.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

Table 1: Mutation effectiveness (mc/mM) and mutation efficiency (mc/S)
corresponding to 20% induced M2 mutants (mc = % of M2-mutants).
Recalculated to EMS values<p>

That means, that for the induction of 20% of M2 mutants a 100 times
lower concentration of MNG than EMS is needed, for MU 50 times lower
etc. Compounds, having a methyl group have a mutation effectiveness of
about 4 to 25 times higher than compounds with an ethyl group.<p>

When comparing the mutation efficiency, however, different results are
obtained. If the value of EMS is equivalent to 100, the values for all
tested nitrosoamides is 60-70. That means that EMS, in comparison with
nitrosoamides, at the same level of induced M2 mutants, induces less
damage, leading to sterility, whether chromosome aberrations, dominant
lethals etc. We suggested that even if nitrosoamides are effective
mutagens, EMS will be more valuable for practical purposes.  This
assumption is valid only when the quantitative aspect of mutations is
concerned, our results give of course no information about the
mutation spectrum.<p>

It is interesting that there are no differences in mutation efficiency
between nitrosoamides, containing methyl and ethyl groups.  In
sulphonates there is a big difference between EMS and MMS, due to the
higher biological damage after MMS treatment (KONZAK et al., 1964).
The same is true in the case of sulphates, where in Drosophila, at the
same survival level, diethylsulphate is 5 to 6 times more mutagenic
than dimethylsulphate (ALDERSON, 1964). In the fungus Colleotrichum,
however, methl nitrosourethane had a higher mutation efficiency than
the corresponding urethane with an ethyl group.  (LOPRIENO et al.,
1964).  From our own and from the quoted results, it is clear, that no
tentative conclusions can be made as to mutation efficiency of methyl
and ethyl group.<p>

It is clear, howevr, that the mtuation effectiveness of compounds,
containing a methyl is much higher than of compounds with an ethyl.
From that we could conclude that methyl or ethyl group has an
important role in the mutagenecity of nitrosoamides. Our results are
in favour of the diazoalkane hypothesis, as the differences found
cannot, in our opinion, be explained by steriochemical differences
only.<p>

Discussion:<p>

BONOTTO: Do you have an idea on the possible mechanism of action of
the nitrosamide in Arabidopsis?<p>

GICHNER: The mode of action of nitrosamides is not entirely clear up
to now. The diazoalkane hypothesis assumes that nitrosamides act via
alkylation and most evidence really supports this. ROSS (Biolgoical
Alkylating Agents. London: Butterworths, 1962) states, however, that
the alkylation by diazoalkanes differs from the alkylation of other
aklylating compounds.<p>

BONOTTO: Do these evidences come from incorporation of labelled
compounds?<p>

GICHNER: No. It has only be proved by P. N. MAGEE and T.  HULTIN
(Biochem. J. 83, 106-114, 1962) that 14C dimethylnitrosamine (another
alkyl-nitroso compound) is incorporated in liver nucleic acids and 7-
methylguanine can be found.<p>

FEENSTRA: I understand from you that you think that from a practical
point of view EMS is still the best compound for mutagenesis, but you
mentioned that Dr. MULLER has another opinion. I would like to hear
from you some more details about this matter.<p>

MULLER: In order to demonstrate a real difference in the relation
between degree of sterility and mutation frequency, it is necessary to
carry out more experiments under controlled conditions.  The degree of
sterility may be influenced by environmental conditions.  Therefore,
the conclusion that the results of Dr. GICHNERs experiments
demonstrate a higher mutagenic efficiency of EMS compared with the
nitroso-alkylureas tested, are not convincing. It is difficult to
decide what is the most suitable compound from the practical point of
view. The advantages of some nitrosamides (e.g., nitroso-methylurea,
N-nitroso-N-methyl- N'nitroguanidine) are: higher molar effectivity,
higher reactivity, absence of toxic hydrolysis products. In
experiments with EMS the growth response may be influenced by the
breakdown products.<p>

FEENSTRA: Did you use any buffer?<p>

MULLER: Yes, I did. Indeed, using buffered solutions this toxic effect
may be removed.<p>

ROBBELEN: In case you advertise the nitrosamides, where to get them?
We can easily get EMS, can you get nitrosamides as easily and where?<p>

MULLER: For any chemical laboratory it is a simple thing to synthesize
nitroso-methylurea.<p>

ROBBELEN: When scoring the number of M2-plants in such a wide
concentration rage as you did, you surely reach that concentration
where in the M1-siliques you can scarcely screen the mutants and
distinguish them from different other kinds of damage. How would you
distinguish whether a deviating embryo results from mutation or only
from modification, in case you use the MULLER-method. Only to say my
experience in the M2 chlorophyll mutation test: I treated not only
seeds but even pollen and egg cells, and I found these deviating forms
frequently after seed and egg cell treatment, while using pollen,
treated with EMS, I did not receive these variants, but the
segregation ratios were quite clearcut. My explanation is, that this
distortion arises predominantly by interference with cytoplasm, which
is not transferred by the pollen tube. The question is, might this
possibly influence your results?<p>

GICHNER: Several mutants found by MULLERs method have been maintained
for up to 10 generations. Whether after high concentrations the
frequency of phenocopies increases we don't know. But it is clear that
most of the "mutants" found are really mutants and not modifications
only.<p>

REDEI: Apparently you are classifying gene mutations, chromosomal
aberrations and various other things in one group. I am wondering
whether you could not get little more accurate information with a
reverse mutation technique. Did anybody try to revert chemically
induced mutants? We have so many mutants now, some of them should be
real nucleotid exchanges, and they should revert.<p>

FEENSTRA: I think there might be difficulties; according to the theory
EMS is causing preferably transitions from G/C to A/T, and thus true
backmutations are less likely with the same compound.<p>

REDEI: EMS should not act on guanine only.<p>

ROBBELEN: I did these experiments. We treated mutants received with
EMS or diethylsulfate. And we got about 2% of the plants with green
sectors (reversions) in the latter case, but only 0.2% in the first by
EMS treatment. Of course, they can originate as well by suppressor
mutations.<p>

REDEI: Yes. You can't eliminate that. But with some mutants this could
be very well done.<p>

FEENSTRA: You got backmutations to wild-type?<p>

ROBBELEN: Yes. But the question is: What is the wild-type? I got green
leaf sectors in the homozygous yellow mutants.<p>

FEENSTRA: If the theory is right you could possibly revert EMS induced
transitions by nitrous acid. We started some experiments with this
compound, but in the meantime we learned from Dr. MULLER that after
treating Arabidopsis with nitrous acid he found no mutants.<p>

REDEI: I wouldn't expect any effect from nitrous acid in higher
plants.<p>

FEENSTRA: But why in Escherichia coli?<p>

MULLER: I should be obliged to make some remarks concerning the
conclusions which can be drawn from Dr. GICHNER's results. He found
that the relation between mc and the concentration in the treatment
solution increases with the increasing concentration and after
reaching a maximum decreases again. That means, he found a sigmoid
dose-effect curve. Such sigmoid curves regularly result in our
experiments with chemical agents.  Dr. Gichner interpreted this
finding as a lower efficiency of very high concentrations. But he did
not take into consideration that the measure mc is not directly
proportional to the number of mutations induced. The effectivity
should be related to the mean number of mutations per cell which can
approximately be calculated as Mc = -ln(1 - mc/f{bar}. By using the
measure Mc I found in similar experiments with nitrosomethylurea
(A.J. MULLER: Zuchter 34, 102, 1964) that even at the highest
concentrations the effectivity does not decrease with increasing
concentration. Furthrmore, Dr.  GICHNER used the relation between mc
and the degree of sterility (mc:S)  as a measure of mutagenic efficiency
and concluded that with increasing dose the efficiency
decreases. Firstly, it seems to be problematic to use the term
"mutagenic efficiency" in this sense.  Secondly, if we do not relate
mc but Mc to the degree of sterility, we shall find that at high
values of Mc the relation Mc:S increases with incrasing dose. But
what does this mean? The degree of sterility says nothing about the
number of haplophasic lethal factors induced.  Evidently it is not
directly proportional to the number of haplophasic lethals. It may be
supposed, that the ratio of haplophasic to recessive lethals increases
with increasing dose (or with increasing frequency of recessive
lethals), because at least a part of haplophasic lethals should have a
two-hit kinetics. But this can't be demonstrated with the help of
relations like mc:S or Mc:S (cf. my remarks on efficiency, effectivity
and degree of sterility l.c.).<p>

GICHNER: I only wanted to say that the highest values of mutation
effectiveness and efficiency are not suitaable for the comparison of
mutagenic activity of different compounds. In our work we compared the
mutation effectiveness and efficiency corresponding to 20% of M2
mutants.<p>

VELEMINSKY: KONZAK has defined the mutagenic efficiency not only as
the relation between M2 frequency of mutants to sterility but also to
all injury, e.g., in Arabidopsis to the length of roots. Do you know,
is the mutation efficiency the same when you base on the strility or
on the root length?<p>

GICHNER: We have not calculated this. For the induction of mutations
the M1 sterility is very important and, therefore, we expressed the
mutation efficiency on the basis of sterility. Perhaps different
results would be obtained if we had recalculated the mutation
efficiency on the basis of survival, root length, germination etc.<p>
