INTRODUCTION<p>

A plant life-cycle bioassay using Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. was
developed to detect potential chemical phytotoxicity (Rodecap et al.,
1981). The bioassay requires large numbers of plants to maximize the
probability of detecting deletrious effects and to avoid any bias that
could occur if only a few individuals are utilized. Therefore, a
culture system was needed which would support large numbers of
Arabidopsis and also permit the chemical treatment of either plant
roots or foliage.<p>

Hydroponic techniques are ideally suited because they allow both root
and foliar applications of chemicals. Although various culture
techniques have been developed for Arabidopsis (Redei, 1970, 1974,
1975; Doddema et al., 1978), the few hydroponic techniques reported
were not designed to support large plant numbers. This paper describes
a double container hydroponic plot culture system. Information on
biomass production, moisture and nutrient distribution within the
culture system are also discussed.<p>

MATRIALS AND METHODS<p>

Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. seeds, Columbia wild type, were
obtained from Dr. G.P. Redei, University of Missouri at Columbia. The
plants were cultured in a double container hydroponic plot culture
system (Anonymous, 1978) detailed in Figure 1.<p>

population of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh<p>

The bottom reservoir contained North Carolina State University
Phytotron nutrient solution (Downs and Hellmers, 1975) and the upper
one contained the growth medium (vermiculite #2 grind, depth 13 cm,
topped with approximately 0.3 cm of #3 grind, surface area 864 cm 2).
Nutrient solution was added to the lower reservoir as needed keeping
the solution level just below the bottom of the upper container. The
solution was transferred into the upper reservoir via capillary action
in 1 cm diameter polyester wicking. The wicks were placed around the
perimeter and diagonally across the bottom of the upper container and
hung down into the nutrient reservoir (Figure 1).<p>

Seeds, suspended in a 0.15% agar solution, were dispersed onto the
growth medium with a separatory funnel (Redei, 1970) and germinated
under high humidity provided either by a mist chamber or perforated
polyethylene film. Plants were grown in a greenhouse or controlled
environment chamber under 1 16 hr light, 8-hr dark photoperiod. In the
greenhouse, sunlight was supplemented with high intensity discharge
sodium vapor lamps yielding a mean maximum midday light intensity of
493 +/- 112 micro E mE-2sE-1 (400-700 nm) at plant height, while in
the controlled environment chamber, incandescent and fluorescent lamps
used in combination yielded a mean light intensity of 324 +/- 33 micro
E mE-2sE-1 (400-700 nm) at platn height. Mean maximum day/minimum
night temperatures in the greenhouse and controlled environement
chamber were 30 +/- 2/20 +/- 1*degree*C and 24 +/-2/19 +/-
2*degrees*C, respectively.<p>

Plant growth was evaluated by harvesting plant materials from 2
containers weekly 9 weeks (18 containers) beginning 1 week after
seeding. Plants were harvested by collecting any mature seeds followed
by the racemes and rosettes. Racemes and rosettes were oven-dried at
70 *degrees*C to constant weight; mature seeds were air-dried.<p>

Moisture distribution in the vermiculite growth medium was determined
weekly in systems similar to those used to evaluate plant growth by
separating the vermiculite-root mass into 3 layers of 12 sections each
(36 samples per container). Moisture content was estimated as the
difference between dry (150*degrees*C to constant weight) and fresh
weights. Diurnal moisture distribution within the vermiculite was
determined using a dewpoint hygrometer (Campbell et al., 1973).
Psychrometric sensors (6 per container) were placed at 2 depths in the
vermiculite of 2 double container hydroponic plot culture systems.
Daily water potential measurements were made starting 1 hr before
initiation of the light period and extending past midday at 3 biweekly
intervals beginning 14 days after seeding. Plant water potential was
determined with a pressure chamber (Scholander et al., 1965) on one
plant from each quadrant of 4 containers at 42 and 49 days after
seeding. Measurements were taken at approximately midday.<p>

Nutrient distribution within the vermiculite growth medium was
estimated after 47 days of plant growth. The vermiculite-root mass
from 4 containers was separated into 2 layers of 4 sections each (8
samples per container). Soluble nutrients were extracted from the
vermiculite sections with distilled water and filtered to remove
fines. Calcium and iron were determined with an inductively coupled
plasma-atomic emission spectrometer (McQuaker et al., 1979) and
ammonia, nitrate plus nitrite, and orthophosphate were determined with
a Technicon AutoAnalyzer II (Jirka et al. 1976).<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

Arabidopsis grew vigorously within the double container sydroponic
system. Rosette weight increased exponentially to day 28 (Table 1) and
then remained relatively constant. Racemes and mature seeds were
evident by day 28 and day 42, respectively. By day 56, mature seed
weight exceeded rosette weight. As plant density was increased from 1
to 15 plants per 10 cm 2, total biomass per container increased from
21 to 40 g dry weight; however, biomass production was not
significantly different as plant density increased from 2 to 15 plants
per 10 cm 2. Anthesis occurred approximately 3 days earlier at the
highest plant density than at the lowest. Arabidopsis growth was
similar both in the controlled environment chamber and in the
greenhouse.<p>

*1. Data are expressed as geometric means and standard geometric
errors (SGE) and are based on 2 observations each, with 407 +/- 30
plants in each container. The weights of all aerial plant components
were summed to determine total above ground biomass. Plants were grown
in a controlled environment chamber.<p>

As the plants grew, there was no significant change in the vermiculite
moisture content through time. The moisture content was highest in the
bottom layer (86%) and decreased to 83% in the top layer. There were
no significant horizontal moisture differences. Visual observation
indicated that roots were distributed throughout the vermiculite
although more were located in the bottom 4 to 5 cm than in the top 7
to 8 cm. Psychrometric measurements indicated a growth medium water
potential of -1.3 bars which did not differ significantly with time of
day. Under these conditions, plant water potential averaged -4.7 +/-
0.8 bars at midday. No significant differences were found in plants
from different quadrants of the containers and there was no visual
evidence of water stress (e.g., wilting).<p>

Horizontal and vertical distribution of selected nutrients within the
vermiculite growth medium was also determined (Table 2).<p>

*1. Data are geometric means and standard geometric errors (SGE) and
are based on 4 observations each, with 417 +/- 57 plants in each
container. Plants were subirrigated with North Carolina State
University Phytotron nutrient solution (Downs and Hellmers, 1975) and
grown in a controlled environment chamber.<p>

Within a layer, no significant gradients in nutrient distribution were
detected, however, vertical gradients occurred. The concentrations of
nitrate plus nitrite, calcium and iron were highest in the top layer.
Since these nutrients are mobile within a suitable pH range (Brady,
1974), they may have been concentrated in the top layer by
evapotranspiration. Ammonia is also mobile (Brady, 1974), so the
observed distribution may reflect ammonia volatilization from the
upper layer. The distribution of orthophosphate within the vermiculite
(highest concentration in the bottom layer) was consistent with its
limited mobility (Brady, 1974).<p>

SUMMARY<p>

Good Arabidopsis growth, lack of visual water stress symptoms and
absence of significant moisture gradients within the vermiculite
growth medium indicated that the system provided adequate water
throughout the life cycle. Nutrient distribution within the
vermiculite was generally as expected. These studies indicate that the
double container hydroponic plot culture system will support good
plant growth and the large numbers required for the bioassay or other
uses.<p>
