<h2>Phytochrome-mediated photoperiodic reactions in two genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) HEYNH</h2><p>

Arabidopsis thaliana is a facultative long day plant without sharply
defined day length and variable to a certain extent in its natural
populations (LAIBACH 1951, HUSSEY 1954, CLAUSS and RAU 1956, REDEI
1970).  LD is more inductive to flowering and there is the
reinforcement of the photophase which is more important for the
induction of flowering than the alterations of the photo-and
scotophases.  LAIBACH (1943) observed that the red and blue parts of
the spectrum were most stimulating to flower induction.  Red-infrared
antagonism was observed in the night break reaction (MEJER 1957, BROWN
and KLEIN 1968).  In some varieties neither red nor green light
induced flowering (MEJER 1959).<p>

Therefore one can postulate that the phytochrome as well as blue light
absorbing pigment are participating in the flower initiation of
Arabidopsis. But, there is still the question of the genotypic control
of these responses to light and also other photoperiodically
controlled characters besides flowering.<p>

We cultivated the standard line En-2 and the mutant ch1 in a growth
chamber (20+/-2*degrees*C) under long day-LD 16:8 hours) and short
day-conditions (SD 8:16 hours).  A light break of 15 minutes red or
far red was given directly after finishing the light phase or in the
middle of the dark period.  The photoperiodic reactions were studied
at the number of flowering plants (at least 1 flower per plant), i.e.
the anthocyanin content of the leaf stalk, the length of the shoot and
the leaf stalk, and the leaf area index (length:width).<p>

Table 1: Different photoperiodic and phytochrome-mediated reactions of
2 genotypes (En-2 and ch1) under long day- and short day-conditions
with a red(R) or far red (FR) light-break given at the end of the day
or in the middle of the night in relation to the control (LD+R=100
p.c.)<p>

Table 1 shows the results of the experiments compared to the control
which is the long-treatment LD+R followed by the 15 minutes red light
break, the latter probably being the best timed induction for a long
day-plant. We can see that flowering occurs only during long day
exposure in both genotypes. The red light break in the middle of the
dark period of the long day exposure shows a considerably higher
reduced number of flowering plants in the mutant ch1 than in the
standard line. The anthocyanin content of the leaf stalks and the
length of the shoots is lower in the mutant.  Under short
day-conditions the leaf stalks are substantially lengthened by much
less in the ch1 than in the En-2.  The light break given as red under
long day-conditions promotes these characters in the mutant more than
in the standard line which shows no differences to the control. After
short day-treatment the leafs of the En-2 do not reach the leaf
area-index of the ch1, which always seen in relation to the control.
We got the same result with the long day-treatment using a red light
break in the dark phase.  Looking at the leaf characters last
mentioned it is most important in which phase of the light dark-cycle
the red or far red light break is given. The phytochrome Pfr activated
by the 15-minute-red-experiment can induce positive as well as
negative photomorphoses. These photoinductions are quantitatively
dependent on the genotype.<p>
