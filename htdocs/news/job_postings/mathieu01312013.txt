Postdoctoral position in plant epigenetics: CNRS, GReD institute, Clermont-Ferrand, France. 

A postdoctoral position is available to study the molecular mechanisms of gene silencing in Arabidopsis thaliana. 
The project is funded by the European Research Council (ERC) and will mainly focus on the characterization of 
mutants isolated following a forward genetic screen. 

The position is open to highly motivated individual with a strong background in molecular biology and genetics and 
good record of scientific productivity. Previous experience with Arabidopsis research is highly desirable. Candidates 
with a strong interest in epigenetics are especially encouraged to apply. Skills and interest in bioinformatics is 
a plus but not essential. The position should ideally start in April 2013.
