In Arabidopsis thaliana it is possible to reveal mutations in
generative tissues of X1-plants before seed maturing (Muller's embryo
test).  Therefore, using the technique of somatic tissue culture we
can state whether the same group of initial cells of the seed or
different ones form generative and vegetative tissues.<p>

A. thaliana seeds (race En) were irradiated with 50 kr gamma-rays,
then plants were grown at 24 +/- 2*degrees*C.  Plants with chlorophyll
deficiency mutations (with normal or somewhat underdeveloped embryos)
were selected and their cauline leaves were cut to get calluses and to
regenerate plants from them.  The technique used was described by
Avetisov et al. (1976)<p>

Table 1: Genetic analysis of the regenerants obtained from cauline
leaves of mutant plants in A. thaliana<p>

Seven X1-plants carrying mutations were studied (Table 1).<p>

There were no mutations in the progeny of regenerated plants obtained
from the leaves of the two chimeric plants Y-1 and XI-1 but in the
progeny of the other five plants the mutations were observed, which
were phenotypically the same as donor plants.<p>

By using test crosses it was proved that the mutations in donor plants
and in the progeny of the regenerants obtained from their leaves were
identical (Shevchenko et al., 1977).<p>

Thus, by the direct method we showed that the same group of initial
cells in apical meristem of the Arabidopsis thaliana seed produced
both generative (main and side inflorescences) and somatic (cauline
leaves) tissues.  These data are in agreement with those of Hirono and
Redei (1965) which were obtained after irradiation of the seeds of
chlorina/+ heterozygotes.<p>
