INTRODUCTION<p>

The biological effects of particles of high energy and charge (HZE)
have been studied in continuation of experiments earlier performed
(Bork and Kranz, 1984; 1985). In this report the results of four
irradiation experiments are presented. The ions used were [20/10]Ne of
19 MeV/n, [40/18]Ar of 19 MeV/n, [131/54]Xe of 18 MeV/n and [238/92]U
of 16,2 MeV/n.  These investigations are performed in the scope of
BIOSTACK-experiments in space, in which the radiobiological properties
of HZE-particles onto various biological objects are investigated
(Bucker et al., 1984; Kranz and Bork, 1984; Gartenbach and Kranz,
1985).<p>

METHODS<p>

The methods of irradiation the seeds and culturing were described
previously (Bork and Kranz, 1984) and have not been changed essential
in this study. The number of seeds examined per particle flux were 200
in the Ne- and Xe-experiment, 100 in the Ar- and 250 in the
U-experiment. The irradiation with Ar was performed with soaked seeds
fixed on agar in small petridishes (*phi* 35 mm). After irradiating, the seeds
were transferred onto aseptic Redei-medium in petridishes (*phi* 94 mm).<p>

RESULTS<p>

Comparison of the results with data of earlier publications (Bork and
Kranz, 1984; Bork and Kranz, 1985) yields the following:<p>

Figure la illustrates the influence of the particle-density on the
germination rate. In the Ar- and the Ne-experiment no effect on the
germination rate up to a particle-density of 5x10 8 p/cm 2 can be
observed. Only the irradiation with 10 9 p/cm 2 of Ne results reduced
germination. With Xe-irradiation a decrease can even be seen at 5 x 10
7 p/cm 2, and with U-irradiation already at 5 x 10 6 p/cm 2.<p>

The HZE-effect on the survival rates is illustated by Figure 1b. In
contrast to the seed germination (Figure 1a), decrease of survival was
observed generally at lower fluencies ( >10 8 p/cm 2 in the Ne-and >10
6 p/cm 2 in the Ar-experiment). The survival in the Xe-experiment
exceeds the values of the Ar-irradiation with the exception of the
value at 5 x 10 7 p/cm 2. The lowest survival rate was observed with
the U-experiment.<p>

The results of the radicle length measured are shown in Figure 2a. The
U-experiment was not considered, because the root measurements had not
been obtained with the standardized seedlings and precise
microcomputer controlled estimations (Bork and Kranz, 1984) of the
other experiments. A decreasing radicle length can be observed at
fluencies above 5 x 10 6 p/cm 2; reduction continues with increasing
fluency. The smallest radicle lengths were obtained in the
Ar-experiment, the highest in the Ne-experiment.<p>

The estimation of embyro-lethality shows similar results (Figure 2b).
Highest embryo-lethality was observed at all fluencies in the
Ar-experiment, the lowest lethality in the Ne-experiment.
Additionally, a distinct increase of embryo lethality with growing
fluency can be seen. The ascent of the curves is very steep at
fluencies above 5 x 10 7 p/cm 2 in the Ne- and Xe-experiment, whereas
the curve of the Ar-irradiation becomes more flat.<p>

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION<p>

The four biological endpoints of the radiation effect, as they are
germination rate, survival rate, radicle length and embryo lethality,
depend evidently on the atomic number (i.e., charge) and the particle
flux (i.e., HZE-density). The biological effects are rising with
increase of the HZE-charge and fluency. The Ar-experiment is an
exception in this respect, since the response to the Ar-irradiation is
more distinct than with Xe-irradiation, although the charge of Xe
(+54) is three times higher than that of Ar (+18). Therefore the
linear energy transfer (LET) of the Xe-ions expected is about 9 times
the LET of Ar-ions, and thus, the rections of Xe-irradiations should
be more distinct. The lower biological effect observed may be
explained by the fact, that the seeds of the Ar-experiment had been
soaked before irradiation. The soaked and thus metabolizing seeds seem
to be more sensitive towards irradiation of HZE-particles than dry
embryos in the resting state. After irradition the damages may be
repaired (at the DNA-level) or restituted (at the cellular level) and
the mechanism at work are disturbed by the irradiation, too.
Additionally, under the hydrated conditions the density ionizing
radiation produces highly reactive Oh-radicales, yielding
DNA-aberrations.<p>

Taking into account, the ontogenetic sequence of the biological
endpoints, the differences of the intensity of the Ne- and
Xe-radiation effects are getting smaller. One reason for this effect
may be, that by proceeding morphogenesis of the multicellular embryo,
damaged cells elements are more and more eliminated.<p>

The cross section for the biological endpoint of nonsurvival of dry
seeds may be roughly estimated from the values of Figure 1b. The cross
section for the U (16 MeV/n)-irradiation is between 3.1 and 9.7 micro
m 2, for Xe (19 MeV/n) between 2.0 and 10.0 micro m 2, and for Ne
between 0.2 and 1.0 micro m 2. These values have to be compared with
the geometrical cross section of the cell-nucleus which is estimated
to be about 12 micro m 2. This means that only 1 to 5 hits per cell
nucleus are needed to reduce survival significantly with irradiation
of ions of high Z (i.e., Xe or U), whereas 6 to 20 hits with heavy
ions of lower Z (i.e., Ne). These values for cross section are near to
the inactivation cross sections which have been estimated with dry
yeast cells (Schneider et al., 1985) and Bacillus subtilis (Schafer et
al., 1985).<p>

The kind of dependence of the biological parameters and the cross
sections on charge and energy of the used HZE-particles can be
determined more unequivocal only by performing more experiments with
heavy ions of different energies, charges and fluencies. These
experiments may be performed at any heavy ion accelerator available,
UNILAC (GSI, Darmstadt). GANIL (Caen, F), Bevalac (Berkeley, USA) and
in further Biostack-experiments in space.<p>

SUMMARY<p>

The biological effect of irradiation with ions of high charge and
energy (HZE) are presented and discussed in this report. The response
towards irradiation has been studied by the biological endpoints
germination, survival, radicle length and embryo-lethality. The damage
increased with higher particle density and with growing charge of the
ions. The estimated cross sections for nonsurvival depend on the
charge of the ions. For significant reduction of survival the number
of hits per cell nucleus is estimated. The effects of different
energies will be studied by further experiments.<p>
