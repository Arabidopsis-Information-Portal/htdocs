Possible Future Bioinformatics Position 

Although we do not currently have a bioinformatics position available in
our plant genomics group (http://www.esd.ornl.gov/PGG/home.html), I
would appreciate receiving resumes and statements of research interests
from highly qualified PhD students and recent graduates who might be
interested in such a position.  We anticipate that a bioinformatics
position might become available in the next few months.

Thanks,
