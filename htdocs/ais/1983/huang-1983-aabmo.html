INTRODUCTION<p>

Somatic embryogenegis is observed in cell and tissue cultures of
higher plants (Street, 1976). Indeed there are now a large number of
species which are capable of producing embryoids in culture (e.g.,
Wang and Vasil, 1983; Litz and Conover, 1982; Rangan and Vasil, 1983;
Geddie et al., 1983). However, perhaps surprisingly, this has not yet
been reported in Arabidopsis thaliana although accounts of root and
shoot formation as well as plant regeneration from cell and tissue
cultures of these species have been known for some time (for review,
see Corcos, 1976). In this communication preliminary results are
reported in which somatic embryos have been induced in callus cultures
of Arabidopsis. This is the beginning of an attempt to understand the
somatic embryogenic pathway in cultures of Arabidopsis thaliana and
compare it with the development of normal sexual embryos.<p>

MATERIAL AND METHODS<p>

Callus was induced from the seeds of A. thaliana on a medium comprised
of Gamborg's B 5 (Gamborg, 1968), mineral salts, microelements and
vitamins supplemented with 2% sucrose (w/v) and solidified with 0.8%
Oxoid agar (w/v). The growth substances were 2, 4-D (0.5 mg/l) and
kinetin (0.05 mg/l). Callus was maintained by subculture at 4-week
intervals on the same medium. All the cultures were kept under
continuous white light (800 lux) at 25 +/- 1*degree*C.<p>

RESULTS<p>

It can be seen from Figure 1a that the callus was composed of numerous
nodules which may differentiate to give rise to roots when transferred
to a medium either devoid of 2, 4-D or containing a low level of IAA
(e.g. 0.1). In some experiments transfer of this nodular callus
through a series of media with different combinations of growth
substances resulted in the formation of plantlets. For example,
nodular callus maintained on a medium containing 2, r-D (0.5 mg/l)
transferred to a differentiation medium with the same nutrient
composition but with 0.1 mg/l IAA and l.0 mg/l kinetin induced
development of the nodules. About 4 weeks after transfer many green
nodules appeared which were highly meristematic and displayed the
ability to produce leaves and shoots as the culture period progressed.
When callus with green nodules was placed on a medium free of auxin
and with a lower kinetin concentration (0.1 mg/l), clusters of
cotyledon-staged embryoids appeared within 3-4 weeks (Figure 1b).
These embryoids were packed together forming an embryoidal mass as
shown in Figure 1b, from which it can be seen that most of the
embryoids are not normal in appearance. The 'cotyledons' of the
embryoids tended to merge together giving rise to a fascicular leafy
structure. Separation of individual embryoids from the embryoidal mass
proved difficult because of the fusion of the cotyledons and the
compact aggregation of the embryoids. A further subculture of these
embryoidal masses to a medium free of added growth substances ensured
the completion of full development of leaves and plantlets (Figure
1d). As might be expected the plantlets thus formed were also packed
in massive clumps and were inseparable from each other.<p>

Figure 1:<p>

For structural and histological examination, embryonal masses were
fixed in 3% buffered glutaraldehyde (pH 7.2) followed by a post
fixation in 1% toluidine blue (TB). Figs. 1D-F are median longitudinal
sections of globular, heart-shaped, and torpedo-shaped embryoids
respectively.<p>

CONCLUSION<p>

The spectacular fact revealed by these sections is that the embryoids
are probably secondary adventive products which have arisen from the
'leaf-like' tissue which had also developed through a somatic
embryogenic pathway. This assumption is based on the close structural
and histological resemblance between the embryoids and the leafy
tissues from which they arose.<p>

Adventive embryoids of similar origin have been documented in a few
cases. In Atropa belladonna L. the term "adventive embryony" was used
to describe the embryoids induced from the suspensor part of the
preformed embryoids in culture (Konar et al., 1972). Repeated
induction of secondary embryoids from embryoid-derived plantlets
through anther culture in Brassica napus was also reported (LOH and
Ingram, 1982). Nevereheless, the origin and early segmentation of the
embryonic cells in A. thaliana still remain to be resolved. Much work
must be done before the complete process of somatic embryogenesis in
this species can be demonstrated. In spite of this, however, it has
been shown in this study that A. thaliana may be numbered among the
species which have the potential to produce adventive embryoids under
culture conditions.<p>
