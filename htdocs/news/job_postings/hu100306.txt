Subject:
[Arabidopsis] Postdoctoral position in plant biochemistry and functional genomics


A postdoctoral position is available immediately in the laboratory of Dr. Jianping Hu at the MSU-DOE Plant Research 
Laboratory, Michigan State University. The successful candidate will join a multi-disciplinary team of investigators 
and use a systems biology approach (proteomics, bioinformatics, cell biology, and reverse genetics) to study peroxisomal 
protein networks in Arabidopsis.

The applicant must have a PhD degree in biochemistry, molecular biology, genetics, or a related field. Prior experience 
with plant biochemistry, cell fractionation, and organelle isolation, as demonstrated by peer-reviewed publications in 
international journals is required. A strong interest in bioinformatic analysis is expected. The selected candidate will 
also work closely with the labs of Drs Andreas Weber (Plant Biology, Michigan State U.) and Laura Olsen (MCDB, U. Michigan).

This research is funded by Arabidopsis 2010 (NSF). Funding is available for two years beginning 10/1/2006 with the 
possibility of extension for an additional two years. Interested applicants should email a CV, a brief statement of 
research experience, and names and contact information of three references to Dr. Jianping Hu (<mailto:huji@msu.edu>huji@msu.edu).
