INTRODUCTION<p>

In this communication, we report the results of screening metallic
compounds for antimutagenic properties towards the promutagen
dimethylnitrosamine (EMN) and the direct acting mutagens
N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine
(MNG) in Arabidopsis thaliana.<p>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<p>

The chemicals DMN and MNU were synthesized at the Institute of Organic
Chemistry and Biochemistry (Praha), MNNG was purchased from Koch-Light
Lab. (Colnbrook Bucks). The metallic compounds screened for
antimutagenic properties were: sodium selenite and cobalt-, cadmium,
nickel- and mercury chloride. All compounds were dissolved in 0.2 M
citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 5.0).<p>

Seeds of A. thaliana (race Dijon) were immersed for 3 h at
25*degrees*C in 1 ml of metallic compounds (in the following referred
to as pretreatment) and then for 3 h at 25*degrees*C in a 2 ml mixture
containing the mutagen and the metallic compounds (in the following
referred to as treatment). The concentrations of the metallic
compounds were the same for both pretreatment and treatment. Higher
concentations of the metalic compounds could not be applied as they
adversely affected the seed germination (in the case of HgCl 2, NiCl 2
and Na 2SeO 3) or they precipitated in the citrate-phosphate buffer
(CdCl 2 and CoCl 2). After the treatment of seeds they were rinsed for
30 min in distilled water and sown on soil in a green house.<p>

For estimating the mutation frequency and for calculating the degree
of sterility, the methods developed by A.J. Muller (1963, 1964) were
used. Three siliquae from 60 plants, i.e. 180 M 1 siliquae were scored
in each treatment. The frequencies of segregating M 1 siliquae
represent the means of 4 replications of randomly evaluated group of
plants with 95% confidence limits. The frequency of chlorophyll
mutants and the degree of sterility were calculated from the pooled
data.<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

Only the highest concentrations of the metallic compounds applied are
given in Table 1. The frequency of mutations and the degree of
sterility induced by the promutagen DMN were not affected by the
presence of Co, Cd, Ni and Hg salts. In contrast, the presence of
selenium reduced the DMN-mutagenicity. The inhibition was
dose-dependent, e.g. 20 mM Na 2 SeO 3 inhibited the frequency of
DMN-induced mutations to 48.3%, 15 mM to 50.3% compared to 74.3%
mutations after DMN-treatment in the absence of selenium. The
inhibition of DMN mutagenesis by selenium was accompanied by a dose
dependent decrease in the degree of sterility.<p>

None of the metallic compounds tested inhibited the mutagenic activity
of the direct-acting mutagens MNU and MNNG (Table 2) and, applied
alone, they did not increase the frequency of mutations above the
spontaneous level (data not presented).<p>

Selenium has attained increasing interest as a chemical and
naturally-occurring compound with potential capacity to reduce
carcinogenesis (Vernie, 1984). In addition, selenium proved
antimutagenic properties; it was shown to reduce the mutagenicity of
e.g. 2-acetylaminofluoren (Jacobs et al., 1977) and 7,
12-demethylbenz(a)anthracene (Martin et al., 1981) in the
Ames-Salmonella-assay.<p>

mutagens N-methyl-N-nitro-sourea (MNU) and
N-methyl-N'nitro'N'nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) in Arabidopsis thaliana
race Dijon.<p>

The mechanisms which have been proposed for the antimutagenic activity
of various chemical compounds include: 1) the direct chemical reaction
between the mutagen and the mutagenic blocker, 2) induction of in vivo
detoxication process, and 3) inhibition of in vivo activation process
(Tacchi et al., 1984).<p>

SUMMARY<p>

DMN is a promutagen requiring a metabolic activation before being
converted to a mutagenic product (McCann et al., 1975). The data of
this communication demonstrate that the presence of selenium inhibits
DMN-mutagenesis in A. thaliana while having no effect on the frequency
of mutations induced by the direct mutagens MNU and MNNG. These
results favour the assumption that the antimutagenic properties of
selenium are caused by an inhibition of the metabolic activation of
DMN.<p>
