Figure 4: DNA gel blot analysis of DNA from plants from Line 2522.<BR>
DNA was isolated from individual plants. The genotype of these plants was
determined by scoring in the next generation for those plants that produced
seed. Lanes are labelled as follows : MM - homozygous male fertile plants,
Mm - heterozygous plants, and mm - homozygous male sterile plants. The DNA
was cleaved with EcoRI, resolved on an agarose gel, transferred onto nylon,
and hybridised to a radiolabelled probe derived from the right border of
the T-DNA. Sizes (in kilobases) of the DNA fragments are shown on the left.
26/26 ms plants contained the 23kb band, along with 3/4 heterozygous plants.<BR>
