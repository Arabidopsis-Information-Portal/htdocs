<h2>The leaf formation rate as a heritable character in Arabidopsis</h2><p>

	In Arabidopsis, there exits a close positive correlation between the flowering time and the number of leaves.  From this fact, it might be inferred that in different genotypes the leaf formation rate (LFR) is the same and that both the flowering time and the leaf number are controlled by the same genetic factors.  However, NAPP-ZINN (1961) assumes that the genetic basis of LFR and the flowering time is different.  Indeed, in a note (CETL, 1965a) it has been shown that there exists radical differences not only in the flowering time and in the leaf number but also in LFR as expressed by the leaves/days ratio.<p>

	Further experiments were carried out on 48 mutually related and unrelated early A2 lines obtained by repeated natural autogamy from local populations (CETL, 1965b).  Plants from control and vernalized seeds (2 weeks at +2+/-1*degree*C) were grown under constant conditions (25+/-3*degrees*C, continuous illumination with 1250 lux) for 42 days.<p>

	The number of days from germination to appearance of the flower primordia (x), the number of rosette leaves (y), and the number of rosette leaves per day (y/x) as an index for LFR were counted.  Corresponding means were estimated for the whole material and for individual lines.  There were significant general differences caused by vernalization:  a decrease of 17 and of 12 percent for flowering time and leaf number respectively, and an increase of 6 percent for the y/x ratio.<p>

	The analysis of variance for x, y, and y/x values (Table 1) shows in agreement with the earlier note (CETL, 1965a) that there are significant differences between lines not only in the flowering time and in the leaf number but also in the number of leaves per day, i.e., in LFR.<p>

	The relations among the mean values of individual lines confirm that the flowering time and the leaf number are closely correlated (r=0.80).  On the other hand, a correponding correlation between the y/x ratio and both preceding charakters has not been proved (r = 0.34 and 0.07 respectively).  This means that LFR is practically independent on the earliness and that in both early and late lines, there may exist different lead formation rates.<p>

	Within the pairs of lines, there is a greater variability in unrelated (non-sister) than in related (sister) pairs, with the exception of the y/x ratio in vernalized plants (Table 2).<p>

	From these results it may be concluded that LFR as expressed by the y/x ratio, similarly as the flowering time and leaf number, represents a heritable character.  This is confirmed both by the significant differences between lines and by the significantly greater variability within the non-sister than the sister pairs of lines.  LFR is independent on the earliness although there is a close correlation between the flowering time and the leaf number; small deviations from the regression line represent considerable differences when expressed in terms of LFR.<p>
