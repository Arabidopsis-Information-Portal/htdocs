Applicants are invited for a postdoctoral position in the laboratory of Dr. Min Ni at the University of 
Minnesota, starting soon or date negotiable. Experience in molecular and cellular biology, 
genetics, and biochemistry will be a plus. Our lab is currently focused on two separate research 
areas: light-regulated de-etiolation and stomatal opening response and Arabidopsis seed 
development. We have identified a few T-DNA-tagged mutants and characterized a few key 
regulators involved in these processes. We aim to study their actions and interactions with other 
components in these signaling pathways by using a variety of tools in molecular genetics, 
molecular biology, and biochemistry. The successful applicant will also have an opportunity to 
characterize existing mutants and to clone the mutated gene from these mutants. For further 
information, please visit our web site (http://www.cbs.umn.edu/plantbio/faculty/NiMin/). The 
University of Minnesota at twin cities provides excellent research facilities and educational 
opportunities (http://www.cbs.umn.edu/biodale/). Diverse cultural and recreational activities are 
easily accessible around the Minneapolis/St. Paul “Twin Cities” area 
(http://www.exploreminnesota.com/home.aspx). To apply, please send, by e-mail, letter of 
application, curriculum vitae, and names of three references (including address, phone, and email 
address) to nixxx008@tc.umn.edu. Min Ni, Department of Plant Biology, 250 Biosci Center, 1445 
Gortner Avenue, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN 55108 (Phone: 612-625-3702). The 
University of Minnesota is an equal opportunities employer.
