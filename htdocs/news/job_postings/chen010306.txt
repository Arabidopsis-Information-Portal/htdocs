Two Postdoctoral Positions in Polyploidy and Epigenetics at the University of Texas at Austin

We seek two highly motivated scientists to work in a dynamic plant genetics and genomics laboratory.  
One candidate is expected to work on functional diversification of duplicate genes and genomes, and 
another candidate will work on genetic and epigenetic mechanisms for non-additive gene regulation in 
Arabidopsis allopolyploids. The projects are funded by the NIH and NSF (http://polyploidy.tamu.edu).

Successful candidates should have a Ph.D. in Genetics, Plant Biology, Plant Biochemistry or 
Computational Biology with a solid training in Mendelian genetics  or evolutionary genetics  
Demonstrated interest in genome evolution and epigenetic regulation of gene expression will 
likely be helpful, as will technical skills in DNA sequence analysis, RNA detection, protein 
assays, RNA interference, microarrays, computational analysis of genomic and microarray data. 
The positions are available immediately. Salary is competitive with experience.

Interested candidates should send a brief statement of career goals and a copy of curriculum 
vitae including names and addresses of three references via email to: Z. Jeffrey Chen 
(zjchen@mail.utexas.edu).

The Chen lab recently moved to the section of Molecular Cell and Developmental Biology 
(http://www.biosci.utexas.edu/MCDB/) and the Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology 
(http://www.icmb.utexas.edu/).  There will be excellent opportunities for postdoctoral 
fellows and graduate students to interact with faculty and students among dynamic research 
groups in the MCDB, Integrative Biology (http://www.biosci.utexas.edu/IB/), and the Center for 
Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (http://ccbb.biosci.utexas.edu/).  Please visit

The University of Texas at Austin is an Affirmative Action/Equal Opportunity employer.
