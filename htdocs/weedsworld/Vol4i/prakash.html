<hr>
      <p>Any farmer or home gardener in the temperate region knows well one
cold fact about the winter: freezing temperatures can kill most plants!
Cold temperatures are a major environmental constraint in improving the
crop productivity in these areas.  Classical plant breeding has had limited
success in imparting cold hardiness to crop plants.  Little is understood
as to why some plant species tolerate cold better than others.
Biotechnology with its powerful tools however may provide answers through
the isolation of cold-fighting genes and thus may help in the development
of  crop plants that can withstand frigid temperatures.  This optimism is
supported by a recent publication from Michael Thomashow's group at
Michigan State University (1) which provides some valuable insights into
how plants respond to cold temperatures.  The research shows for the first
time that freezing tolerance can be enhanced in plants through an insertion
of a single gene involved in cold-acclimation.</p>

      <p> Mike Thomashow's strategy has been to understand 'cold
acclimation', a process where plants exposed to low, non-freezing
temperatures somehow learn to put up with subsequent freezing temperatures.
For instance, 'cold-acclimated' rye plants can survive temperatures of up
to -30C!   The underlying reasons for this phenomenon  appears to be
complex but it is known that cold acclimation is controlled by many genes
and that cell membranes are particularly vulnerable to cold damage.
Thomashow and colleagues have isolated many genes that are turned on during
cold acclimation in <i>Arabidopsis</i>.  One
such gene is COR15a  which is speculated to have a role in freezing
tolerance.</p>

      <p> The Michigan group developed transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants
expressing the COR15a  gene in a constitutive manner.  In regular plants
this gene is turned on only through cold acclimation while the transgenic
plants showed COR15a  gene product in both cold-acclimated and non
acclimated plants.  Chloroplasts in leaves of transgenic plants showed
reduced damage to freezing temperatures when compared to those from the
control plants.  Further, in collaboration with Peter Steponkus and
colleagues at Cornell University, it was found that protoplasts isolated
from transgenic plants survived better at subzero temperatures (18% better
survival at -6.5C) than the control.  Although the COR15a  gene produces a
chloroplast-targeted protein, the results indicate that the expression of
gene may also affect other cellular functions including improving the
cryostability of the plasma membrane.</p>

      <p>The COR15a  gene enhanced the freezing tolerance of chloroplasts in
engineered plants by almost 2C which was nearly one-third of the increase
seen due to cold-acclimation.  While this might not appear as a large
increase, an improvement of freeze tolerance by 2C could potentially
benefit certain crop plants, argue Artus <i>et al</i>.  There are many more COR
genes known to scientists and if one stacks them up together in a plant,
even more dramatic tolerance to cold especially at the whole plant level
may be achieved, according to Thomashow.  Ongoing research in Michigan lab
is striving to further understand the intricacies of plant gene expression
in response to freezing temperatures and this knowledge may empower
scientists to develop crop plants which can brave the cold.  Clearly, the
molecular biology has the potential to help plants and farmers beat the
winter blues.
