INTRODUCTION<p>

There are a great number of results indicating that plants regenerated
from somatic calli, microspores or protoplasts are very often
phenotypically different from original forms (De Paepe et al., 1981,
1982/83; Engler and Grogan, 1984; Evans et al., 1984; Ahloowalia and
Sherington, 1985). An estimation of the frequency and understanding of
the genetic basis of this so-called "somaclonal variation" seems to be
very important for its evaluation as a new source of genetic
variation, useful for plant breeding. Scowcroft (1984) has discussed
some examples of mechanisms which can generate somaclonal variation.
A. thaliana, as it was suggested by Negrutiu et al. (1975), is an
especially suitable plant for such model experiments on plant cell
genetics, considering its easy regeneration from somatic callus.<p>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<p>

5-6 weeks old rosette leaves of hybrid plants from a cross of a
recessive mutant with closely linked genes as py er with the wild type
parent strain Wilna were used in this experiment. Callus was obtained
on PG 2 medium and after 8 weeks transferred onto PG 3 medium
(Negrutiu et al., 1975) on which plant shoots began to regenerate
after the next 8 weeks. Plantlets regenerated from callus were passed
on the half strength Murashige and Skoog (1962) agar medium with 1
mg/1 GA 3 for rooting. Calli were kept at a temperature of 25 +
3*degrees*C under continuous illumination with 1000 lux. Regenerated
and controlled plants were grown at a temperature of 22 + 3 *degrees*C
under daily illumination 18h. Aseptic culture on agar medium Mikshe
and Brown (1965) was used for growing F 1 plants from seeds, as
control.<p>

Tests of recessive embryo-lethal mutations (Muller, 1963) and
frequency of chlorophyll mutations, were used to determine the level
of genetic variability generated during the callus culture. The
analysis of genetic markers segregation was carried out on the F 2
progeny of 22 callus derived shoots.<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

To evaluate the effect of the age of callus culture on the level of
somaclonal variation, callus derived plants obtained from the first
subculture on regenerated medium (8-12 weeks) as well as plants from
the second subculture (13-16 weeks) were investigated separately. In
both cases, the frequency of lethal embryos was much higher compared
to the control but plants regenerated from older callus indicated a
slightly higher frequency (Table 1).<p>

Table 1: The frequency of chlorophyll mutaions and lethal embryos in
callus-derived plants of Arabidopsis thaliana in relation to age of
culture.<p>

Lethal embryos were found in 9.2 and 12.4 percent of analysed seeds of
callus derived plants from younger and older callus tissue
respectively. The frequency of lethal embryos in siliques of control
plants was only 1.2 percent and similar to the data for Arabidopsis
thaliana published by Meinke and Sussex (1979) or Redei (1982).<p>

Embryos with chlorophyll mutations were only found in siliques of
plants regenerated after 13 to 16 weeks. Taking into consideration
that several shoots regenerated from the same callus can carry mutants
derived from one mutation event we calculated the frequency of
chlorophyll mutations in relation to primary calli from which plants
have been regenerated (Table 2).<p>

Table 2: Chlorophyll mutations in relation to primary calli and number
of analysed shoots.<p>

On the basis of this calculation we found that the frequency of the
older calli which have given shoots with chlorophyll mutations was
rather high and reached 3.1 percent. This result reconfirmed previous
data of other authors that the level of somaclonal variations
increased with the age of callus culture. This was observed e.g., by
Armstrong et al. (1983) for triticale, by Escandon et al. (1985) for
Tradescantia crossifolia and by Sutter and Langhans (1981) for
Chrysanthemum.<p>

Plants regenerated from callus culture indicated a very high sterility
in comparison to control plants which were obtained from seeds.
Similar to the above presented results the age of callus culture was
an important factor which increased sterility (Table 3).<p>

Table 3: The fertility of callus-derived plants of A. thaliana<p>

Plants regenerated after 13 to 16 weeks of one callus culture (second
subculture) had a 40.2 percent reduction of fertility in comparison to
31.8 percent for another callus. The decrease of fertility in white,
rhy and triticale callus-derived plants was observed by Eapen and Rao
(1985). Very frequent, chromosomal aberrations (Groose and Bingham,
1984) or changes in the polyploidy level (Engler and Grogan, 1984)
were considered as a reason for observed disturbances in fertiltiy.<p>

The genetic analysis of F 2 generation from callus-derived plants has
been done to find if in-vitro culture conditions may effect the level
of genetic recombination. The F 2 progeny of 16 from 22 analysed
plants (only one shoot per callus was considered) indicated a
segregation ratio of 3:1 for each of the investigated markers (Table
4).<p>

The analysis of segregation in progenies of six other plants indicated
an important deviation from the expected ratio. Observed ratios of
35:1 and 21:1 were typical for segregation of tetraploid forms with
duplex genote (Table 5). The cytogenetic analysis of ten randomly
taken callus-derived plants showed that 3 of them had the number of
chromosomes 2n = 4x = 20. The similar frequency (27%) of tetraploid
forms was estimated on the basis of the genetic segregation. All
tetraploid, callus derived plants did not express any morphological
changes. Their fertility as well as vitality were the same as in
diploid forms. Similar tetraploid plants of Arabidopsis thaliana were
described by Bouharmont (1965) after treatment of seedlings by
colchicine. Changes in number of chromosomes were very often found in
callus culture cells of various plants (Bayliss, 1980; Novak, 1980) as
well as in Arabidopsis (Negrutiu et al., 1975). The great amount of
tetraploid forms among callus derived plants as found in the presented
experiment, indicated that an increase in the level of ploidy did not
affect the morphogenetic capacity of callus cells. It was very often
postulated, that cells with the normal number of chromosomes have
selective prevalence in plant regeneration from callus culture. Gross
chromosomal modification, changes in their number of high amoung of
DNA were observed in callus cells having lost their regeneration
potential (Berlyn, 1982; Lupotto, 1984; Tempelaar et al., 1985).
Nevertheless, Toncelli et al. (1985) informed that somatic embryos
were regenerated in carrot cell culture from cells with important
abnormalities in structure and number of chromosomes.<p>

SUMMARY<p>

Presented results indicated that somaclonal variation was generated in
described in vitro culture conditions. Callus-derived plants of
Arabidopsis thaliana carry a high frequency of point mutation and
changes in the number of chromosomes. In another paper we showed that
fast-neutron irradiation may significantly increase the level of
genetic changes in callus cells (GAJ and Maluszynski, 1986).<p>
