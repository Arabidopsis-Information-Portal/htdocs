Vol 01:<h2>REDEI, G. P.</h2><h2>An episome resembling factor in Arabidopsis</h2>

The nature of an episome is not completely understood.  It is claimed
however, that it may exist in two states (integrated and autonomous)
and it is an addition to the genome.  Mutant im seems to satisfy these
criteria.  By various external factors the phenotype of the cells may
be changed from white to green and vice versa as if a special element
would be transient from one stage to another.  The recessive gene
responsible for this alternating function is chromosomal since tight
linkage with another marker, vc2 has been demonstrated.  Irrradiation
with X-rays resulted in an increased greening as if the white stage
would be an integrated state.  Removal of the element suppressing the
locus appears to restore normal chlorophyll production (autonomous
state).  The variegation cannot be permanently removed, however,
neither by irradiation nor by any other treatments of considerable
phenotypic effect.  It appears as if the radiation would dislodge
temporarily a single controlling element or it would cause thinning
out of several suppressor units.  This displaced episome may later be
reintegrated or the decreased number of the independent elements may
reach the original level after several replications.  The phenomenon
may also be interpreted as a V-type position effect.  The two
interpretations are not mutually exclusive.  Experiments designed to
uncover the basis of this variegation are underway.<p>
