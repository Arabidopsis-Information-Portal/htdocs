The leaves and stems of Arabidopsis thaliana contain anthocyanins
which show up well in older leaves and in axils.<p>

Genotypes apparently without anthocyanins were found in the progeny of
mutagen treated seeds. These are all characterized by "yellow" seeds
(due to the absence of seedcoat pigments). The coincidence between the
absence of both anthocyanins and seedcoat pigments in monogenic
mutants suggests a (partial) common biochemical pathway of both types
of compounds (Koornneef, 1981).<p>

Among the Wageningen mutant collection some mutants have a phenotype
intermediate between wild type and yellow seeded mutant, i.e., they
have a reduced anthocyanin content in leaves (inferred from visible
observations) and have pale brown to yellow ochre coloured seeds. Two
of these recessive mutants (d501 and T155; both EMS induced) were
found to be allelic. The mutant d501 showed complementation to wild
type in F 1's of crosses with repesentative yellow seeded mutants of
the loci ttg, tt-1, tt-2, tt-3, tt-4, tt-5, tt-8. Furthermore
complementation was found in F 1's of crosses of d501 with mutants at
the loci tt-6, tt-9 and tt-10 each of which is represented by a single
pale-brown seeded mutant. The gene, denoted as tt-7, was located near
one end of chromosome 5 as it showed close linkage to the late
flowering gene fy (Koornneef et al., submitted). (No double recessive
recombinants were found among the 253 plant of a repulsion phase F 2
population).<p>

Anthocyanins, anthocyanidines and flavonol aglycons were analysed by
thin layer chromatography with suitable solvents (Wiering and de
Vlaming, 1973). Two distinct anthocyanin spots (differing in
intensity) were visible on plates with the wild type extracts, while
with the tt-7 extracts one spot with a more red colour and a slightly
higher Rf value was observed. We did not identify the glycosylation
pattern of these three anthocyanins. The only anthocyanidin detected
in wild type was cyanidin (hydroxylated at the 3' site of the B-ring)
while in tt-7 mutants it was pelargonidin (no hydroxylation at the 3'
site). In wild type extracts both the flavonol aglycons kaempferol and
quercetin (rsp. without and with a hydroxyl group at the 3' site, see
Figure 1) were observed while in tt-7 mutants only kaempferol could be
detected. From these results it is concluded that the gene tt-7
controls hydroxylation at the 3' site of the B-ring of the flavonoid
skeleton. Apparently a common precursor of anthocyanidins and
flavonols (dihydrokaempferol?) is normally hydroxylated at the 3' site
and subsequently conversed to cyanidin and quercetin. A blockade in 3'
hydroxylation step in tt-7 mutants leads to synthesis of pelargonidin
and kaempferol.<p>

The results presented in this contribution clearly indicate that tt-7
controls 3' hydroxylation of the C 15 skeleton of flavonoids and is in
its effect similar to gene Htl in Petunia hybrida (Tabak et al.,
1978), the gene Eos in Antirrhinum majus (Forkman and Stotz, 1981) and
the gene B in Mathiola incana (Forkman et al., 1980).<p>
