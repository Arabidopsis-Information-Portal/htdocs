Postdoctoral Position in Ethylene Signal Transduction 
 
A postdoctoral position is currently available in the laboratory of Dr. G. Eric Schaller (Dartmouth 
College) to work on a DOE-funded project to examine the roles of post-transcriptional regulation in 
ethylene signaling. One focus of this project is on how physical interactions among the ethylene 
receptors coordinate signal output (Gao et al., 2008, J. Biol. Chem. 283:23081-23810). In addition, we 
are characterizing how a small family of novel proteins modulates signaling by the receptors. 
Successful applicants should be highly motivated, be capable of working independently, and have a 
relevant PhD. Experience in some or all of the following disciplines is desirable: genetics in model 
systems, molecular biology, and/or biochemistry. 
 
Application Instructions: Please send a letter of application describing research background, a CV, and 
the names and contact information for three references to G. Eric Schaller at Dartmouth College, Dept. 
of Biology, Hanover, NH 03755 or by email to george.e.schaller@dartmouth.edu.
