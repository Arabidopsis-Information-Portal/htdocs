Session 7: Metabolic Regulation</H1>

<H4>
Chair: Gloria Coruzzi, New York University, USA</H4>

<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>The ability of metabolites to regulate metabolic and developmental
processes is well documented in microorganisms. Both carbon and nitrogen
metabolites have also been shown to regulate growth/development and the
expression of numerous genes in plants.Understanding the mechanisms by
which metabolic sensing and signalling occurs in plants, has both evolutionary
and practical implications. Session 7, entitled Metabolic regulation highlighted
research on metabolic regulation in <I>Arabidopsis</I>, focusing on gene
regulation and the identification of components of the metabolic sensing/signal
transduction pathway using mutant and gene identification approaches.

<P>Gloria Coruzzi showed that carbon and nitrogen metabolites act in a
reciprocal fashion to regulate the expression of a set of nitrogen assimilatory
genes in <I>Arabidopsis</I>. She described an <I>Arabidopsis</I> homologue
of PII, a component of a carbon:nitrogen-sensing/signalling system in bacteria.

<P>Jen Sheen's studies concern the role of hexokinase, a known sugar sensor
in yeast and mammals, as a sugar sensor in plants using a transgenic antisense
approach. She has also used a mutant approach to isolate <I>gin</I> (<I>glucose
insensitive</I>) mutants that define components downstream of the sugar
sensor in the glucose signal transduction pathway and reveal cross-talk
between sugar and plant hormone (e.g. ethylene) signalling.

<P>Ian Graham presented work on their <I>carbohydrate insensitive</I> (<I>cai</I>)
mutants isolated by their ability to form green cotyledons under high sucrose
low nitrate conditions. Several of these mutants also show increased resistance
to mannose which halts wild-type seedling growth apparently due to sequestration
of Pi. In one such mutant, <I>cai10</I>, mannose resistance appears to
be due to an increased flux of carbon out of the hexose phosphate pool,
thus highlighting the possibility that mutants altered in carbohydrate
metabolism may give a sugar sensing phenotype even though they are not
necessarily disrupted in signal transduction.

<P>David Lightfoot presented a <I>gsr1</I> (<I>glutamine sensing regulatory</I>)
mutant selected on media containing high concentrations of methylamine
and glutamine. The <I>gsr1</I> mutant showed a complex pattern of aberrant
regulation of nitrogen assimilation and chloroplast function. The failure
of the mRNA abundance of GS2, AS1, NR1 and GDH1 to respond to exogenous
glutamine treatments in <I>gsr1</I> suggest the mutant phenotype reflects
the pleiotrophic effects of the failure to sense glutamine concentration
within the cell.

<P>Eric Ward's presentation focused onadenylosuccinate synthetase, an enzyme
in de novo purine biosynthesis, the target for hydantocidin, a natural
product with potent herbicidal activity. Based on the crystal structure
of the enzyme/inhibitor complex, a site-directed mutation was made that
decreases sensitivity to inhibitor by almost 100-fold. Preliminary results
indicate that expression of the mutant gene in <I>Arabidopsis</I> results
in tolerance to hydantocidin.
