Emasculation is carried out under a sterio-microscope (10x) by means
of a small pipette connected to a water jet pump.  The pipette is
drawn from a piece of thin-walled glass tubing, the entrance should be
wide enough to let the largest anthers pass, but otherwise the tube
should be as small as possible, to inflict as little damage upon the
flowers as possible. A hypodermic needle, from which the pointed end
has been cut off, will also act.  The air flow is controlled by a
pedally operated valve.<p>
