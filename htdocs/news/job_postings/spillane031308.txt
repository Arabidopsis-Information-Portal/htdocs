Postdoctoral Fellow 
 
University College Cork, Ireland 
 
Our lab is seeking applications from highly motivated postdocs to work 
on genetics of reproduction in Arabidopsis thaliana polyploids. The 
successful applicant will work within a small team of researchers 
investigating sexual and asexual reproduction (apomixis). We seek 
enthusiastic and highly motivated candidates with excellent and 
proven skills in plant genetics, genetic mapping, molecular biology 
and reproduction (as demonstrated by their publication record). We 
particularly seek candidates with experience of association/QTL mapping, 
DIC/fluorescence microscopy, in situ hybridisation, cytogenetics and 
chromatin analysis in Arabidopsis thaliana. The project is funded 
for three years and collaborators include Dr Magnus Nordborg (Uni of 
Southern California), Dr Tom Juenger (Uni of Texas) and Dr Tim Sharbel 
(IPK Gatersleben). The successful applicant will work closely with two 
PhD students working within the same funded project. 
 
Prospective applicants should send an e-mail outlining your research 
interest and motivations, including; (a) your C.V. (please list 
publications and experimental skills) & (b) contact details and 
e-mail addresses for 3 referees to: Dr. Charles Spillane, Genetics & 
Biotechnology Lab, Biochemistry Dept & Biosciences Institute, University 
College Cork, Cork, Ireland. E-mail: c.spillane@ucc.ie
