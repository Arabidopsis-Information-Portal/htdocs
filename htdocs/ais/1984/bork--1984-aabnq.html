INTRODUCTION<p>

The experiments with particles of high energy and atomic number (HZE)
produced by powerful accelerators (esp. UNILAC of GSI, Darmstadt) have
been continued (Koller-Lampert and Kranz, 1982, 1983) in order to
improve qualification tests and to examine the biological effects of
HZE-particles. These investigations are close connected with the
Biostack-experiments, in which the biological effects of cosmic
radiation (esp. HZE-particles) onto various biological objects are
investigated (Bucker et al., 1978, 1981; Kranz and Bork, 1984).<p>

METHODS AND MATERIALS<p>

The seed material and methods for irradiation at UNILAC (GSI) as
previously described (Koller-Lampert and Kranz, 1982; Kraft et al.,
(1980) have not been changed. The procedures for evaluation of the
biological effects were improved and standardized (Kranz and Bork,
1984). Especially the radicle test (Muller, (1964) became better in
handling the seeds and by measuring only the root length of 4 days old
seedlings with a Leitz-Orthoplan microscope converted to
micropositioning and data processing by Sirius I microcomputer. The
number of seeds examined was 200 per particle-density.<p>

RESULTS<p>

In this paper the results of the irradiation-experiment with articles
of 19.MeV/n Ne are presented and compared with data of earlier
experiments.<p>

Figure 1 shows the grmination-curves of the Ne-irradiated seeds and of
the 18.MeV/n Kr-irradiation-experiment previously performed by
Koller-Lampert and Kranz, 1983. Germination is only reduced in the
Kr-irradiated seeds with increasing fluency. The radiation-effect by
Ne is small and can only be seen at the very high flux-density of 1*10
9 p/cm 2.<p>

In Figure 2 the influence of particle density on the survival of the
seedlings can be seen very clearly, even in the Ne-experiment. The
curve of this experiment shows a shoulder which had also been found in
earlier experiments (Koller- Lampert and Kranz, 1983) with different
HZE-particles. The shoulder in the Kr-cure is not as stronglyt marked
as in the Ne-curve.<p>

Figure 1 and 2 are clearly showing that there must be a strong
influence of the charge and/or mass of the HZE particle onto the
biological effects, because both irradiations had been performed with
nearly the same energy per nucleon.<p>

Figure 3 presents the summarized results of the Ne-experiment. Some
more parameters had been evaluated. The particle-density seems to have
an unequivocal influence onto the survival, the embryo-lethality and
the radicle-length. Survival and radicle-length are reduced with
increasing fluency of Ne. Embryo-lethality raises with increasing
fluency. The correlation of particle-density with each of the two
other parameters, i.e., total mutation-rate R and mutation frequency
mc (dwarfs, multicaulus plus sublethals) all measured in M2, is not
significant. But this may be based on a nonrepresentative sample size
of M 1 and M 2 which is a prerequisite of successful mutant screening
(Kranz, 1984). Also it is necessary to get more standardized culture
conditions and to examine all samples of the different
particle-densities simultaneously as far as possible. The spectrum of
observed mutants must be defined more precisely.<p>

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION<p>

The irradiation of seeds with 19.MeV/n Ne-particles shows a strong
influence on the parameters survival, embryo-lethality and radicle
length. Survival and radicle-length are decreasing and
embryo-lethality raises with increasing particle fluency. A comparison
of the results with data of an experiment with Kr (18.MeV/n) shows
that the effects on germination and survival become more dramatic with
increasing charge and mass of the projectile.<p>

These results raise some more questions:<p>

a) Does there exist a dependency of all examined parameters not only
with increasing fluency but with inceasing charge, mass and energy of
the projectiles?<p>

b) What kind of dependency do we get for each parameter? Answers are
expected from further experiments at the accelerators (Unilac and
Bevalac) as well as from Biostack-experiments at the space shuttle.<p>
