In a previous report we described the results of preliminary
experiments on the normalisation of lethal mutants in different
nutrient media (USMANOV et al., 1974)<p>

Immature seeds of the phenotype albina were extracted from the pods of
heterozygous line (monogenous segregation) and placed in a special
medium inducing the callus formation.  The callus obtained after the
first passage was of snow-white colour.  However, very soon the callus
attained a bright green colour. The prresent paper presents our
analysis of ultrastructure of cell tissue of the green section from
the growing callus of the lethal mutant 9-al.<p>

Figure 1: Ultrastructure of three types of green callus tissue cells
in the lethal mutant 9-al of A. thaliana.<p>

Tissues of green callus were found to consist of 3 types of cells.
First of all, there were vacuolized parenchyma cells with thickened
cell walls.  The central large vacuole of such cells is lacking any
inner structure despite some small membrane-bounded vesicles (Figure
1a), which might be the projection of the transverse sections of the
lomasome-like bodies through the vacuoles. Cytoplasm in these cells
was restricted to a thin layer near the cell wall.  Multivesicular
bodies very frequently contained visicles of different size attached
to be plasmalemma. Sometimes openings were formed in plasmalemma,
through which the vesicles passed to the cell wall (Figure 1b).
According to to several authors these multivesicular bodies are
involved in wall synthesis and confirm transport to the wall
precursors of its compounds. The origin of multivesicular bodies in
plant cells is still unknown. The second type of green callus cells is
characterized by a regular distribution of the cytoplasm. The plastids
are similar to that of amyloplasts with fine starch grains in intact
tissues of the roots and storage organs (Figure 1c, d). They have no
highly organized membrane system and the grana consist of 3 to 6
thylakoides. And at last, callus tissue appeared to have some small
cells with their cytoplasm containing numerous ribosomes,
mitochondria, and dividing plastids. These cells resemble young
meristem cells.  The albino tissues of the callus contained the
leucoplast type of plastids.<p>
