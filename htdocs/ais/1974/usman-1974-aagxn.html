Mutant embryos (Fig. 1A) have been isolated from pods in five
heterozygote strains of A. thaliana which segregate in the lethal
chlorophyll mutations of the albina (9-al) and xantha (8-xy, 79 P
10/43 xa, 127 xa) type. Their further cultivation on the specially
composed artificial media demonstrated great biomass of the
increasing, proliferating callus (Fig 1B), and from the callus the
organogenesis has been induced followed by the formation of normal
pods (Fig. 1C-H).<p>

This data being somewhat tempting, it is worth noting some details of
cultivation of the mutant material. Rapid accumulation of the callus
mass (for 8-10 days) has been observed on the medium containing:
vitamins (according to JACOBS), casein 0.01%, glucose 2%, 2-4D 1 mg/l,
kinetin 1.5mg/l.  The plant regenerants have been obtained on the
media: a) vitamins (JACOBS), succhrose 2%, casein 0.01%, kinetin 1
mg/l, IPA 0.03 mg/l; b) succhrose 2%, adenine (JACOBS) IAA 2mg/l,
kinetin 2mg/l, casein 0.01%, DPN 4mg/l, NADP 1 mg/l, thiamine 50 mg/l,
D-biotin, i-inositol, thiamine chloride, folic acid (according to
JACOBS), alanine, DL-serine, L-valine, L-tryptophan, aspartic acid,
glutaminic acid (JACOBS).<p>

Differences have been observed in the colour of leaves, i.e., in the
range from white and light-yellow to pale green, and the rate of
development (from 30 to 45-50 days).<p>

Electro-microscopic analysis revealed that growth and development of
the lethal mutants occurred exclusively without the activities of the
photosynthetic apparatus, and the energy processes, probably, were
exercised mostly by mitochondria. This is indicative by the increasing
number of mitochondria obtained in the ultra-thin sections:<p>

These results may be of interest in solving different biological
problems.<p>
