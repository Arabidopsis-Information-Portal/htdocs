The aim of this investigation was to study the evolutionary changes in
populations of self-pollinated plants treated by ionizing radiation.<p>

The populations were composed as a mixture of seeds of 3 races of A.
thaliana: En, vc'er and gl'an.  The seeds of separate experimental
variants were irradiated by *gamma*-rays 30 and 80 kr (treatments
*gamma*-30 and *gamma*-80) or by fast neutrons 3 and 10 krad (no-3 and
no-10).  Repeated irradiation was used after two generations
(treatments *gamma*-30x2, no-3x2 and no-10x2).  The seeds were sown in
plastic dishes (*phi* 20 cm) with soil and grown under continuous
illumination in two replications.  In every dish (one replication) at
each generation about 100 seeds were sown sampled with no selection
from all fertile plants of the previous generation of the given
experimental variant.<p>

Analysis of changes in plant character was being done: plant height
stalk length (measured from root neck to the first node) and the
number of internodes on central stalk. After single irradiation
generations are indicated as Mi, and after repeated irradiation as Ri.<p>

Dose of 80 kr *gamma* -rays appears to be lethal.  Other treatments
caused a depression in survival and plant growth and a prolonged
period till the flowering time in M1.  In M2 the plants gl'an were
completely eliminated from all experimental variants including the
unirradiated control. With irradiation by no-3 and in the control the
prevailing race turned out to be wild form of En, while by irradiation
*gamma*-30 and no-10 the most radiation resistant race was vc'er
(Dishlers and Rashals, 1973).<p>

The values of arithmetical mean (x) of characters analized (in
relation to x of those at control) in successive generations gradually
increased under the influence of radiation. This effect is shown in
Table 1 where the values of regression of relative x on generation are
present. By all treatments the values of x of all three characters at
M8 and R6 exceed those at the control. By repeated irradiation as well
as by no-10 an extremely high increase of x was observed.  It
indicates that an intense process of directed natural selection in
irradiated populations of self-pollinated species takes place.  The
changes of x of the characters analized was not related with any
changes in the relative amount of different components of the initial
population.  Consequently, it was assumed (Dishlers and Rashals,
1975a) that an induced genotypic variability was the main source of
evolutionary changes observed.<p>

The data obtained after the study of plant variability showed the
following (Dishlers and Rashals, 1975b).  At irradiated as well as
control populations the phenotypical coefficient of variability (v) of
plant characters analized increased in some of the first generations.
In M5-M6 the maximum values of v were observed after which a decrease
commenced. Evidently, this decrease is a display of stabilizing
natural selection eliminating the plants with significant deviations
from model class in growth.<p>

of A. thaliana (in percent to control) in successive generations after
single and repeated irradiation.<p>

In order to find out the nature of changes of phenotypical variability
the values of genotypical variance (*sigma* sq. sub g) for such
characters as plant height and number of internodes were determined in
M2, M5 and in M7 through the response of the selection of 10 percent
intensity. The data summarized in Table 2 show that the changes of
(*sigma* sq. sub g) in successive generations are not connected with
changes of v: the maximum values of (*sigma* sq. sub g) , as a rule,
were observed in M2 and a sharp decrease in M5 and M7.  We suppose
that an increase of v until the 5th-6th generation is caused by
growing different genotypes in a bulk.  In this case the variability
due to different intrapopulation competetive ability of plants
(*sigma* sq. sub g(com)) is manifested. Detrmining the causal
components of variability through the response on selection, the
(*sigma* sq. sub g(com)) joined together with an environmental
variance. The decrease of (*sigma* sq. sub g) in M5 - M7 is a result
of stabilizing natural selection.<p>
