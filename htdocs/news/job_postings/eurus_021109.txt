A possibility for one Post Doctoral fellowship is available in the lab of 
Dr Jenny Russinova at the VIB/Department Plant Systems Biology/University 
of Ghent, Ghent, Belgium. The aim of the project is to use a chemical 
genetics approach to study protein trafficking in plants. By screening 
several chemical libraries we identified a set of small synthetic 
molecules that affected the trafficking of a number of plant plasma 
membrane receptors. We want to use those compounds as bioactive molecular 
probes for functional analysis of the plant receptor endocytosis. 
We are looking for a motivated and hard working Post Doctoral scientist 
with a solid background in cell and molecular biology, basic skills in 
biochemistry, a deep interest in receptor signalling and a nice and 
collegial working spirit. Experience with plants, GFP imaging and confocal 
microscopy is required. Experience with chemical genomics would be an 
advantage. We will consider only EU applicants. 
For more information about the project and the application procedure 
please contact Dr. Jenny Russinova (0032 933 13931; 
eurus@psb.vib-ugent.be).
