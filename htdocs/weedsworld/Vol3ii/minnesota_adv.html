<H2>Opportunity for a Computational Biologist in Plant EST Analysis</h2>
Plant Molecular Information Center, Computational Biology Centers, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.<p>

<hr>
We are seeking a postdoctoral associate to participate in the mining of
the data that has been generated from the plant EST projects, the
largest of which is the <I>Arabidopsis</I> project.  Thus far, the project has
involved the generation of raw sequence data from the MSU sequencing
project headed by Dr. Tom Newman, the processing and analysis of that
data, the development of tools for the manipulation and exploration of
that information, with the primary emphasis on the creation of
resources. <p>
We are now looking for additional partners with primarily
biological backgrounds to explore the mountains
of information that have been acquired, analyzed and databased.  
Candidates need only be reasonably skilled in the use of computers, 
since most of our team is highly skilled in the areas of software and 
database development.  We have begun to pose
interesting biological questions, and are looking for interested people
to extend these questions.  This is not to discourage or exclude those
who may have programming skills from applying, but rather to encourage
and include those who have a keen interest in exploration of
information, as well. This position is available immediately.

<p>
Further information about the various plant EST projects can be found
at <A HREF="http://lenti.med.umn.edu/" target="_top">http://lenti.med.umn.edu</A> under "Research Projects."  Interested
persons can contact me directly at the addresses/phones below.  Of
particular interest to me would be your current research focus, and
what led you to consider the computational aspects of analysis.
