The figure for total unique genomic sequence in GenBank is derived from the
data used by TAIR to construct its Sequence Map. The value is obtained
by first adding the sizes of all AGI entries in the following three
categories in TAIR's AGI database:

<ul>
<li>completed, annotated sequences (in TAIR: "Annotated GenBank release")
<li>completed, non-annotated sequences ("Sequencing completed")
<li>not yet completed clones ("Non-annotated GenBank release")
</ul>

From this total is then subtracted the total of the 5' and 3' overlaps
(divided by two) between entries as determined by TAIR using BLAST.

<p>
The current estimate of 117 Mb of unique sequence comes from presentations
at the AGI meeting held at TIGR on August 22, 2000.  This estimate is subject
to revision.  Not included are repetitive regions from the NORs, telomeres
and centromeres, which contain ~7Mb of rDNA and 5Mb of 180bp tandem
repeats.
