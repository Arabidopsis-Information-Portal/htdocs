INTRODUCTION<p>

Generally, the seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana do not germinate in
darkness. However, some mutant strains can germinate even in darkness
by gibberellic treatment (Koornneef et al., 1977). The present report
will describe the relations between characteristics of seed coat and
gibberellin sensitivity of some mutant strains on germination in
darkness.<p>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<p>

Three wild lines and six mutant strains of Arabidopsis thaliana
(L.)Heynh. were used. In them, line En2n, strains En2nfly and
En2nfly+b have been kindly supplied by Professor A.R. Kranz, J.W.
Goethe-Universitat, Frankfurt/Main, and line Landsberg and strain Ng-5
by Dr. Koornneef, Agricultural University, Wageningen. The seeds were
incubated on 0.8% agar containing gibberellins (pH 5.5) in the dark at
25*degrees*C and the number of germinated ones were counted after a
desired period. Scarification was carried out as follows: a small hole
was made in the seed coat with a needle point under a stereoscopic
microscope. The presence of mucilage was decided by estimating the
size of water layer cohered around a seed which was placed on 0.8%
agar.<p>

germination (%) in darkness.<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

Table 1 shows the characteristics of seed coat and germinate rate on
the gibberellin-containing agar. All of these lines and strains are
able to germinate at about 100% in the light. The seeds with brown
seed coat (due probably to an anthocyan-like substance) secrete some
mucilaginous substance through contact with water. Moreover, each cell
of their seed coats has a structure of a central elevation which
swells up after absorbing water. The mucilage is probably secreted
from it. Conversely, the transparent seed coat of the mutant strains
has no structure of the central elevation and so does not secrete the
mucilage (Figure 1). These characteristics of the seed coat have also
been reported by Koornneef (1981). The stain F used here may be the
same as ttq mutant (Koornneef, personal information).<p>

The sensitivities to GA 3 of the strains with brown seed coat varied
greatly. The three wild types were scarcely affected by GA 3 but
sensitive to GA 7 and GA 4+7 (En2n showed low germination rate on the
5th day but germinated almost 100% on the 10th day). All the strains
with transparent seed coat were highly sensitive to all the three
gibberellins tested here. Strain Ng-5 also showed high sensitivity to
all the gibberellins, being similar to the reports by Koornneef et al.
(1977) and Koornneef (1978). This fact suggests that the lack of the
mucilage may not determine the sensitivity to gibberellins.<p>

Table 2: Effect of GA 3 and GA 7 on germination (%) of line Estland
and mutant F in the dark.<p>

Table 2 shows the sensitivities of line Estland and strain F to GA 3
and GA 7. Strain F germinated on GA 3 nearly 100% at 10E-5M by 5th day
and at 10E-6M by 15th day, although line Estland scarcely germinated
even at 10E-4M. Strain F was sensitive to GA 7 at 10E-6M on the 5th
day but line Estland was only at 10E-4M even on the 15th day. Strain F
was about 1000 times as sensitive as line Estland to GA 7.<p>

Table 3: Effect of seed scarification on germination (%).<p>

Scarification was carried out by making a small hole in seed coat with
a needle point under stereoscopic microscope. The scarified seeds were
allowed to germinate on 0.8% agar containing gibberellins (30 mg/l) in
the dark for 5 days at 25*degrees*C.<p>

Table 3 shows the effect of scarification on the sensitivity to
gibberellins. Scarification itself was not effective on lines En2n and
Estland but caused line Landsberg to germinate 66%. However, scarified
seeds were sensitive to all the three gibberellins in all the lines.
These results suggest that the seed coat of En2n hardly lets any of
gibberelin through, that of Estland does not pass GA 3 but admits GA 7
and GA 4+7, and that of F, En2nfly and En2nfly+b admits all the
gibberellins. If any gibberellins once enters a seed, germination may
inevitably occur regardless of the seed coat characteritics.<p>
