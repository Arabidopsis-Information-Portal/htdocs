If you join my laboratory, you will be focused on understanding how plants perceive and integrate 
stress signals. To achieve this goal, you will study the priming phenomenon in the model plant 
Arabidopsis thaliana. By joining my laboratory, you may also participate in research projects 
aimed at the identification and characterization of genes associated with the Arabidopsis response
to pathogens, in particular, the role of Lectin Receptor Kinases in Arabidopsis innate immunity. 
Recent researches performed in my laboratory were published in international peer-reviewed journals 
such as the Journal of Experimental Botany (Wu et al., 2010), The Plant Journal (Chai et al. 2011) 
and PLoS Pathogens (Desclos-Theveniau et al., in production). Proven ability to write and speak English 
is desirable. Chinese language skills are not required. Interested applicants should contact 
Dr. Laurent Zimmerli at lauzim2@ntu.edu.tw to arrange for an interview.

The National Taiwan University is a renowned university in Asia and provides excellent conditions 
for research. This university is located in Taipei, a vibrant and amazing city.
