Research associate and PhD position Circadian rhythms, RNA-protein-interaction
University of Bielefeld, Germany

Positions are open for a research associate and a PhD student to study the molecular 
basis of the Arabidopsis circadian system. Possible areas of research include the interaction of the 
circadian system with the environment, the identification of targets of a circadian slave oscillator 
using transcriptomics, post-transcriptional control, RNA-protein interaction, or related topics. Our 
group enjoys strong collaborations with the Department of Physics as part of the collaborative research 
program SFB 613 Single molecule processes and molecular recognition.
The position for the research associate is available for 3 years initially with the possibility of a 
long term extension. The PhD position is available for 2 years initially.
Applications are encouraged from candidates with a strong background in molecular biology and plant physiology.
