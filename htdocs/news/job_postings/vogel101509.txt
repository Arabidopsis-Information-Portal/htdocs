Brachypodium positions with CSIRO and the USDA-ARS 
 
CSIRO in collaboration with the USDA-ARS is offering three positions- two 
Postdoctoral Fellowships and a PhD scholarship- to join an international 
team applying the recently sequenced grass genetic model Brachypodium to 
developing more efficient food and biofuel crops. 
 
Successful candidates will be based at the Black Mountain Laboratories in 
Canberra, Australia, and have access to state-of-the-art plant measurement 
technologies at the High Resolution Plant Phenomics Centre in Canberra. They 
will be part of an international team with Dr. John Vogel and the USDA-ARS 
in Albany, California. The positions are well-resourced with technical 
support and funding from the Australian Grains Research and Development 
Corporation and the US Department of Energy. 
 
The research team has access to a diverse collection of natural, mutagenised 
and transformed genotypes of Brachypodium, and has conducted a detailed 
analysis of Brachypodium sequenced line Bd21 shoot and root system 
development to provide the baseline for identifying genotypic variation. See 
http://www.brachypodium.org/ for information on Brachypodium. 
 
1) Postdoctoral Fellow - Plant Biologist or Root Biologist 
 
The successful applicant will use Brachypodium to identify genomic regions 
associated with root architecture traits that increase water and nutrient 
uptake in wheat. Wheat lines with diverse architectures have already been 
identified. (International applicants)

2) Postdoctoral fellow - Plant physiology or molecular biology 
 
The role of this person is to phenotype diverse genotypes of Brachypodium 
for variation in traits valuable for biofuel and food crops. These include 
rapid shoot growth, high tillering, high photosynthetic rates and good water 
and nutrient use efficiency. (International applicants)

3) PhD Student - Plant Biologist/ Plant Pathologist 
 
The goal of this PhD studentship is to apply Brachypodium to identify 
tolerance or resistance mechanisms to key root diseases of wheat.
