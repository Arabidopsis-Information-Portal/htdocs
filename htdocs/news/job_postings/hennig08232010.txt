Two positions for postdoctoral researchers are available in the group of Dr. Lars Hennig. We will 
move to the Swedish University for Agriculture Sciences, Uppsala (Sweden) in October 2010, and we 
are looking for highly motivated individuals to join a young and dynamic group. The successful 
applicants will work in a research team studying genetic and molecular aspects of epigenetic control 
of development in Arabidopsis with a focus on flowering time pathways. 

The positions are open to enthusiastic individuals with a strong record of scientific productivity. 
Applicants should have a solid background in molecular biology and genetics or biochemistry; skills 
and interest in bioinformatics are desired but not essential. Candidates with a strong interest in 
epigenetics are especially encouraged to apply. 

Applications, including CV, a description of research experience and interests as well as contact 
information of two-three referees should be submitted by e-mail to Dr. Lars Hennig 
(*lhennig@ethz.ch*). The position is available from October 2010.
