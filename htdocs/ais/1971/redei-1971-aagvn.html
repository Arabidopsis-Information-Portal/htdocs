At the present time three main types of "nutritional" mutants are
available in our laboratory. Type 1 require normal metabolites for
growth, type 2 cannot be normalized with natural cellular products but
respond favourably to antimetabolites and type 3 is extremely
sensitive to metabolites supplied in the nutrient solution and becomes
lethal on media favorable to the growth of the wild type.<p>

In our laboratory the absolute organoauxotrophic mutants reported so
far all required thiamine or some precursors of this compound (REDEI,
1965a; LI and REDEI, 1968).<p>

Some of the late flowering mutants were inducible to flower early with
8-azaadenine and halogenated deoxyribopyrimidines (HIRONO and REDEI,
1966a, b).  Similarly another antimetabolite, 6-azauracil, was found
to normalize mutant phenotype by promoting chloroplast differentiation
in a variegated mutant (REDEI, 1965b, 1967a,b).  The same mutant
displayed an improved phenotype also upon irraidiation with high doses
of X-rays (REDEI, 19678c).  Actually mutants at as many gene loci were

This year another unusual type was isolated.  This mutant, though
easily distinguishable from the wild type in soil cultures or on
mineral-sucrose-agar media, produces fair amounts of seed under these
conditions.  On our complete medium, containing supplements (mgs/1) of
yeast extract (10), yeast hydrolysate (10), casein hydrolysate (50)
and coconut milk (20 ml), plants of the same genotype fail to grow
beyond the four leaf stages and bleach and die within a period of 3-4
weeks (Figure 1).  On this same nutrient solution the wild type and
several other genotypes, with defective photosynthetic apparatus grow
very well. The identification of the physiological mechanism of mutant
No. 405-A-154 is underway.<p>

media (right) respectively.  The print was made from a positive color
film, therefore the plants appear dark on the complete medium though
in reality they were white.<p>
