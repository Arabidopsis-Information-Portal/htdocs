After nitrosoguanidine treatment of seeds of A. thaliana we isolated
in the M2 a mutant, showing resistance to elevated concentrations of
chlorate.  If wildtype seedlings of about 6 days old are exposed to
chlorate in a concentration of 250 mg/l, the plants lose their green
color and die within 6 days. Toxicity of chlorate, however, depends on
the nitrogen source of the seedlings.  We found that plants, grown on
a solution with ammonium as the only nitrogen source (solution F), are
more sensitive than plants grown on ammonium nitrate (A).  Plants
grown on nitrate (D) are least sensitive to chlorate, but as
mentioned, do die within 6 days.<p>

Our chlorate-resistant mutant grown on solution D shows very little
damage from 250 mg chlorate/l.  The relative nitrate reductase
activities of extracts of the wild-type (extract preparation and
enzyme-essay following SANDERSON and COCKING, 1964) for seedlings
grown on F, A, and D, respectively, are: 1, 6, and 8.  On solution D
our chlorate resistant mutant turned out to have a nitrate reductase
activity of about 1.5 - 2 times higher than the wildtype.<p>

The results suggest a positive correlation between the resistance to
chlorate and the level of nitrate reductase activity.  This is quite
different from the data of LILJESTROM and ABERG (1966) obtained with
young wheat plants. Their experiments strongly support the hypothesis
that chlorate resistance in wheat plants is negatively correlated to
the level of nitrate reductase activity, suggesting that damage is
caused by the chlorite generated from chlorate by the nitrate
reductase.<p>
