A. thaliana is an extremely convenient subject not only for genetic
investigation but also for the physiological and biochemical ones
because during a short period of vegetation it has to provide itself
with a large amount of various plastids and therefore the speed of its
photosynthesis reaction is very high.<p>

A joint research project carried out by the Biochemistry Department of
the Tajik State University together with the Department of Cotton
Genetics of the Tajik Academy of Sciences on the regulatoring
mechanisms of certain structural genes responsible for the
physiological and biochemical processes will make it possible to
reveal mutants with certain specific damages of the electron transport
chain of photosynthesis. That is why A. thaliana and its mutant 58/15
(viridis) were chosen as the subject of the following investigations.<p>

There is a certain difficulty in obtaining photochemically active
chloroplasts out of A. thaliana leaves as the isolation media used for
obtaining active chloroplasts out of leaves of peas, spinach and other
plants have turned out to be unacceptable.  In this connection a
proper isolation medium for A. thaliana chloroplasts was necessary.<p>

We have tested different buffers and components. Chloroplasts isolated
out of the medium containing tris HCl pH 7.8, NaCl 0.3M, PVP 0.25%,
serum albumin 1.5%; ascorbic sodium mg/ml have shown the greatest
photochemical activity. The medium which sharply becomes acid in the
process of obtaining homogenate and chloroplasts should be constantly
controlled when chloroplasts were isolated from the leaves. Comparison
of the photochemical activity of the original form of A. thaliana with
mutant 58/15 was carried out on the active chloroplasts. The
experiments were carried out in plants at the phase of the rosette
formation.  Photochemical activity of the chloroplasts was determined
by the restoration of ferrocyanide and by photophosphorylation. The
results of the Hill reaction and photophyspohorylation are presented
in Table 12.<p>

The Hill reaction level on ferrocyanide restoration is two times as
high as that of the original form when the chlorophyll content is
less.  The Hill reaction is known to increase parallel to the increase
of the chlorophyll content.  Our data show that the Hill reaction is
higher when the chlorophyll content is lower. This can be evidently
explained by the fact that the chlorophyll quantity has reached the
saturated concentration for the Hill reaction in mutant leaves, or
that the pigment present is characterized by high photosynthetic
activity. The absence of any maximum in the mutant in the spectral
areas of 554 nm of the cytochrome which is known to be connected with
the cyclic transport of electrons had been previously shown. These
data allowed us to assume that there is a block in the cyclic electron
transport in mutant 58/15.<p>

Highly intensive photosynthesis as well as the Hill reaction and
photophosphorylation in mutant are good arguments for considering the
defects in the cyclic electron transport to be compensated by the
noncyclic electron transport.<p>
