<h2>SPIRAL GROWTH OF HYPOCOTYLS IN MUTANT AUX-1 OF ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA</h2>

Many living things display a "handedness", that is, a spiral in only
one direction. The extensive occurrence of spiral structures in
plants, at the molecular cellular, tissue and organ levels, is
striking and rather amazing although their morphogenetic or general
biological significance is not clear in most cases.<p>

The mutant aux-1 of Arabidopsis thaliana has been characterized to
exhibit 14-fold increased resistance to applied 2, 4-D and IAA (Maher
and Martindale, 1980), agravitropic roots, faster and greater
gravitropic response of hypocotyls, increased elongation of roots
accompanied by reduced elongation of hypocotyls (Mirza, et al., 1984),
and absence of seed coat retention at the root-hypocotyl transition
zone (Mirza and Maher, 1985). The present paper describes the spiral
growth of hypocotyls in mutant aux-1.<p>

The mutant aux-1 was induced and isolated in Arabidopsis thaliana L.,
ecotype Landsberg, erecta mutant as described by Maher and Martindale
(1980). The parent plant itself is here designated as "wild type"
(WT).<p>

Wild type and aux-1 seeds were sown on surface of 1 percent (w/v) agar
in 9 cm diameter polystyrene Petri dishes. The dishes were stored at
4*degrees*C for 2 days before incubation (agar surface vertical) at 25
+/- 1*degree*C for the first 4 hours in light and then in darkness.
After incubation for various periods, the developmental stages of
seedling hypocotyls were recorded by taking photography and by drawing
sketches of seedlings observed under the microscope.<p>

In aux-1 seedlings, hypocotyls grew straight until about 60 hours of
incubation, but after this period they grew in a spiralled manner
(Figure 1.)<p>

The spiral growth was always in a clockwise direction when viewed in
the direction of hypocotyl elongation (i.e. from below the
cotyledons). The spiral growth was associated with the clockwise
rotation of the hypocotyl along its axis which was apparent by the
oblique arrangement of epidermal cells. In aux-1 seedlings, the
hypocotyls elongated with seed coats enclosing the cotyledons (Mirza
and Maher, 1985). However, the spiral growth of hypocotyls was not
affected even if the seed coat was detached at an early stage. On the
other hand, WT seedling hypocotyls grew straighter with epidermal
cells arranged parallel to the hypocotyl axis during 96 hours of
incubation. Sometimes, however, WT hypocotyls showed a very slight
tendency towards spiral growth in both clockwise and counterclockwise
directions, and this was associated with a corresponding rotation of
the hypocotyl axis in the same direction. In WT seedlings, the seed
coat was mostly retained at the root-hypocotyl transition zone and
hypocotyls elongated with naked cotyledons. Nevertheless, WT
hypocotyls grew straighter even when cotyledons were enclosed by the
seed coat.<p>

The spiral growth of aux-1 hypocotyls is distinct from circumnutation
(see review by Johnsson, 1979) observed in different organs of many
species. During circumnutation, the tip of an organ undergoes helical
growth movements which arise as a result of different extension rates
on different sides of the organ. Hence the tip of the organ moves in a
spiral during growth but the organ itself does not develop spirals and
remains straight.<p>

The more rapid and greater gravitropic response of aux-1 hypocotyls
compared to WT (Mirza et al., 1984) should be considered in relation
to the spiral growth of aux-1 hypocotyls. Peripheral (especially
epidermal) cell layers, it has been suggested, play an important role
in the gravitropic curvature of hypocotyls (Iwami and Masuda, 1974;
Firn and Digby, 1977, 1980). I WT hypocotyls, epidermal cells normally
lie parallel to the hypocotyl axis, whereas in aux-1 the epidermal
cells are obliquely arranged during the spiral growth of hypocotyls.<p>

The mutant aux-1 of Arabidopsis thaliana exhibits spiral growth of
hypocotyls. The spiral growth is always clockwise (as seen from below
the cotyledons) and is apparently associated with the clockwise
rotation of the hypocotyl along its axis. On the other hand, wild type
seedling hypocotyls grow straighter.<p>
