Postdoctoral Position: Arabidopsis circadian clock

A *Post-doctoral position* is available immediately to investigate the plant
circadian clock in the new Division of Integrative Biosciences and
Biotechnology at Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) in
Pohang, South Korea.

The successful applicant will help establish a new laboratory in newly
renovated research space with research opportunities to study
post-translational processes, in particular phosphorylation, controlling the
circadian system in Arabidopsis. There will also be the opportunity to
initiate new genetic screens probing into the fundamental properties of the
circadian clock. The lab will be housed in a building sharing growth
facilities and other resources with excellent, well-established plant
molecular groups at POSTECH, along with newly established labs in membrane
biophysics and chemical biology of protein-protein and lipid-protein
interactions.

Expertise in biochemistry, proteomics and molecular biology is highly
desirable, but not required. Previous experience with Arabidopsis research
is not a requirement, but very useful. Ability to work independently and
coordinately will be an important asset. Highly motivated individuals with
excellent English language and communication skills are strongly encouraged
to apply.

Starting yearly salary will be 25,000,000 KRW to 35,000,000KRW depending on
experience.

Interested applicants should send inquires and their CV, a statement of
research interests and career goals, to:
