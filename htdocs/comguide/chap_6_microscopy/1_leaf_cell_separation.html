*  This method is an adaptation of the methods of Possingham & Smith 
(1972, J. Exp. Bot. 23, 1050-1059) and of Boffey, Ellis, Sellden & 
Leech (1979 Plant Physiol 64, 502-505).

1.  SOLUTIONS
  (i) (A)  0.5% (w/v) glutaraldehyde (Sigma, dilute 25% (w/v) stock with 
water).
  (ii) (B)  0.1M  Na2EDTA, (pH 9).

2.  PROCEDURE
  (i) Harvest leaf tissue and fix in 3.5% glutaraldehyde (A) for one hour in 
the dark.  Leaves less than c. 25 mm2 can be left intact otherwise cut the 
leaves into 1 mm wide pieces with a new double-sided razor blade.  For 
small leaves, Eppendorf tubes are the best containers to use.  If 
harvesting many samples at once, use 96-well microtitre plates.  
Samples from larger leaves are best in glass vials with plastic snap-on lids 
(e.g., Camlab).
  (ii) After fixing, remove the glutaraldehyde carefully with a pipette and 
replace with 0.1M Na2EDTA (pH 9)(B).  Make sure the depth of liquid is 
sufficient to cover the tissue pieces so that they can move about.  Place 
in a shaking water bath (100 shakes min-1) at 60oC.  Make sure both that 
the lids have holes in to prevent them popping off and that the labels 
don't float off in the warm water.  The length of time of heating necessary 
to give good cell preparations varies between species and for the first 
leaves of Arabidopsis two hours is sufficient.  For older leaves a slightly 
longer time may be necessary, but certainly no more than three hours 
will be required.  If samples from small leaves are in Eppendorf tubes, 
heating them in a heating block works very well.
  (iii) After heating, let the still-green samples cool and store in a fridge at 
4oC.  Samples will keep for years in these conditions although the 
chlorophyll will slowly fade over a period of months.  To make slides for 
observation, take a small piece of the prepared leaf tissue, place on a 
slide with a drop of 0.1M Na2EDTA and tap gently, but firmly with the 
blunt end of a metal scalpel handle.  The tissue should break up easily.  
Put on a thin cover slip (size 1).  On viewing, the cell suspension should 
contain large numbers of individual isolated mesophyll cells (over 
tapping will cause excessive cell damage and release of individual 
chloroplasts).  The intact cells can be used for counting chloroplasts in 
individual cells.  By using Differential Interference Contrast Optics 
(Nomarski), which allows optical sectioning of the cells so chloroplasts on 
the bottom surface of the  cell can be counted independently of those 
on the top surface, the total number of chloroplasts within individual cells 
can be determined.  Counting is most easily done using an eyepiece 
grid and counting chloroplasts within each square of the grid at different 
levels of focus.  Mesophyll cell plan areas can also be measured in these 
cell preparations either following photomicrography or by image analysis.  
Wheat leaf cells prepared by this method are shown in Pyke and Leech
