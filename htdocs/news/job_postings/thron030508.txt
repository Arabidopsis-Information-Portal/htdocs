 
The Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research (MPIZ) seeks 
 
 
 
a post-doctoral scientist 
 
 
 
to establish Affymetrix chip hybridizations for different types of array. In 
addition the successful applicant will work closely with research groups to 
prepare hybridization experiments and analyze the data. The position will be 
based in the DNA core facility which houses a DNA sequencing service, robots 
for array construction and an Affymetrix chip hybridization station. 
Extension of the facility to include massively parallel sequencing 
approaches is planned for the next year. 
 
 
 
We seek a candidate with a PhD in biology, genetics or a related field. 
Previous experience with array hybridizations or other genomics-based 
approaches would be an advantage. Very good English skills are required and 
German language skills would be advantageous. Payment and benefits are 
according to the German TVÖD. The position will initially be limited to two 
years with the possibility of a further extension depending on performance.
