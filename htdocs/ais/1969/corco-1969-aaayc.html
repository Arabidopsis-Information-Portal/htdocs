Genetical and biochemical analysis in microorganisms has been greatly
facilitated by the use of conditional lethal mutations.  Affected
organisms die under "restrictive' conditions but survive in a
"permissive" environment.<p>

One class of conditional lethals, the temperature-sensitive mutants,
have been detected also in higher organisms, e.g., in Arabidopsis
(LANGRIDGE, 1965) and in corn (ROBERTSON and ANDERSON, 1961).  In
Drosophila melanogater (SUZUKI et al., 1967) temperature-sensitive
mutants have been created by artificial mutation and extensively
analysed. To the writer's knowledge, no similar work has been done
with plants.  Yet, of particular interet would be morphological
mutants that would lead to a detailed study of plant development by
locating various intermediate steps, made apparent by the effects of
defective genes.<p>

Seeds of the variety Estland were treated with
N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine at 10 or 100 micrograms per ml for
24 hours, rinsed in distilled water, and germinated on minimal medium
(VELEMINSKY and GICHNER, 1964) in 200 mm tubes (one seed per tube).<p>

At high concentration, see Table below, germination seemed to have
been impaired.  Of 78 seeds, 15 germinated.  Among those, 3 lacked
chlorophyll.  The remaining 12 grew slowly, though they reached
maturity.<p>

At low concentration of the mutagen, however, no injury to the embryo
could be detected.  The first generation of treated seeds were
harvested and seeded on minimal medium in petri dishes (100 seeds in
one petri dish) and placed in a growth chamber at 28*degrees*C.  All
the seedlings that germinated at that temperature were discarded and
the petri dishes were transferred in another growth chamber at
16*(degrees*C.  The seedlings which germinated at that low temperature
were then transferred into test tubes and placed at 28*degrees*C to
continue their life cycle.  Seeds of these suspected mutants were
seeded at low and at high temperature.  Only 8 of the 20 tested were
indeed germination temperature-sensitive.<p>

Among the trated plants, three albino wre obtained but could not be
rescued on complete medium and two did not shoot a flower stalk at
either 16*degrees*C or 28*degrees*C.<p>
