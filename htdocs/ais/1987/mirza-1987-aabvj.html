Recently many attempts have been made to investigate the influence of
phytohormones on the mutation processes. It has been suggested that
the nature of antimutagenesis in plants may be elucidated in course of
close study of this problem. It has been shown that spontaneous and
induced aberrations of Allium fistulosum and Triticum aestivum
chromosomes were diminished by phytohormones (Mehti-Zade et al.,
1981).<p>

The aim of the present investigation was to study the influence of
phytohormones on mutation processes in Arabidopsis thaliana. Mutations
were induced by gamma irradition of A. thaliana seeds at doses of 100
and 300 Gy. High doses of irradiation were used since they were shown
to give reliable conclusions about the effectiveness of applied
antimutagens (Alekperov et al., 1983). After treatment with mutagen, a
portion of seeds was planted in the agarized minimal medium (control
group). The seeds of experimental groups were treated with one of the
phytohormones (auxin, gibberellin, kinetin) for 18 hours before
planting in the given medium. Unripe pods were analyzed by Muller's
embryo test for the presence of chlorophyll mutations.<p>

The results obtained are given in Table 1. As it has been shown there,
auxin (10mg/1) diminished the level of mutations from 19.3+/-2.43% to
12.0+/-3.57%. This reduction is not statistically valid. At auxin
concentration of lmg/l the level of mutations decreased more
intensively (from 19.3+/-2.43% to 9.4+/-2.31% P<.01). The diminishing
percentage mutation frequency was 51.3+/-3.95%, at auxin concentration
of lmg/l and 37.8+/-5.32% at auxin concentration of 10 mg/l.
Differences in efficiency of two doses of auxin concentration were
significantly (P<.05).<p>

*gamma*-irradiation induced mutations in A. thaliana.<p>

The results obtained are in good agreement with those of previous
experiments. As it has been shown by Mehti-Zade et al. (1981) the
ability of auxin to exercise influence on the frequency of mutations
was dependent upon the dose of phytohormone, the low doses of auxin
being more efficient as compared with high ones. Drobesheva et al.
(1980) demonstrated that frequency of mutations in E. coli also
diminished by auxin.<p>

Gibberellin (lx10E-1mg/l) reduced gamma irradiation induced mutation
from 10.6+/-1.86 to 3.9+/-1.92 (P<.05). At the same time the
gibberellin concentration of lmg/l exerted no significant
antimutagenic effect on mutation frequency in A. thaliana. Only
negligible decrease of mutation level (from 19.3+/-2.43% to
16.7+/-4.07%) has been noted.<p>

Unlike the investigations with Allium fistulosum only one of two
concentrations used (1x10E-1mg/l) could prove efficient. Using this
dose, the mutation frequency was diminished by 63.2+/-4.78, the
differences in efficiency of gibberellin 1mg/l and gibberellin 1x10E-1
mg/l significant.<p>

Kinetin included in our investigation has also been shown to diminish
frequency of induced mutations in A. thaliana. At the kinetin dose of
10 mg/l the antimutagenic effect of the hormone was insignificant.
Kinetin at the dose 10 mg/l diminished mutation frequency from
10.6+/-1.86 to 8.8+/-2.97 (P<.05). At the concentration of 1x10E-1mg/l
kinetin was more effective in diminishing frequency of mutations from
10.6+/-1.86% to 4.2+1.45% (P<.05). Differences in the effectiveness of
the two kinetin doses were highly significant (P<.001).<p>

Thus, present investigation makes it possible to establish the ability
of auxin, gibberellin, and kinetin to diminish the frequency of gamma
rays induced mutations in Arabidopsis thaliana. Antimutagenous effect
of phytohormones is found to be dose dependent, i.e., low doses of
auxin, gibberellin, and kinetin were more effective than high doses.<p>
