Apart from very few constantly fasciated taxa like Celosia cristata
and one pea cultivar already grown for several centuries, fasication
studies have normally been limited to single fasciated specimens of
various species, which appeared then and when spontaneously.  Only
since the discovery of artificial induction of mutations, sufficient
material of this kind may be easily obtained. Also McKELVIE's (1962)
mutant clavata-1 (clf1) has been induced by chemical mutagenes.<p>

This mutation originally appeared within an early flowering summer
annual strain, and is primarily characterized by club shaped pods (to
which its name refers, this shape being caused by central
proliferation).  The responsible gene has pleiotropic effects; under
all conditions blossoming is delayed, and it causes fasciation.  In
order to make the manisfestation of fasciation independent from the
growing conditions, we introduced the gene clv1 into two late
flowering stains (florens-2 (f2) and florens-5 (f5) which regularly
produced fasciated shoots even under long day conditions. The
morphological comparison of late flowering fasciated plants f2 f2 clv1
clv1 and f5 f5 clv1 clv1) with the corresponding normal ones (f2 f2 ++
and f5 f5 ++) shows the following results:<p>

1.  Already in the rosette stage fasciated individuals have a higher
leaf formation rate than normal ones (cf. PLANTEFOL 1974: Hedera).
With increasing plant age the leaf number difference increases
absolutely and relatively.<p>

2.  As the leaves of fasciated plants are smaller, their total dry
weight is approximately the same as in normal plants.<p>

3.  The increase of the leaf number in clv-plants is connected with an
increasing enlargement of the growing point to a kind of growing line
(or growing edge); only in clv-plants there is, simultaneously, an
increase of the number of parastichies. At a place where one
parastichy branches into two, a forked (dichotomous, "double") leaf
may be found (cf. PLANTEFOL 1968a,b: Hedera). Such forked leaves have
only been seen in fasciated plants.<p>

4.  Among shooted clv-plants four types of fasciated stems, probably
pure modifications could be distinguished, no. 1 and 2 corresponding
to GEORGESCU's (1927) classification:<p>

1.  the bilateral stem (with two planes of symmetry),<p>

2.  the dorsiventral stem (with only one plane of symmetry),<p>

3.  the multi-edged fasciated stem (asymmetrical), and<p>

4.  the serpent-like fasciated stem (asymmetrical).<p>

Anatomical investigations in shoot apices yield some further results
as follows:<p>

1.  The distal part of the shoot apex which is still devoid of leaf
primordia, is much higher (and broader at its base) in fasciated
plants then in normal ones.  Fasciated plants thus differ from normal
ones in the same way as water shoots of amphibic plants do from aerial
shoots (McCULLY and DALE, 1961: Hippuris).  When points of leaf
initiation keep equal distances from each other, more leaves may thus
be initiated at the same height in fasciated individuals than in
normal ones.<p>

2.  In fasciated plants, procambium is formed at a greater distance
from the growing than in normal ones. This fact is probably related to
the "delayed" leaf formation.<p>
