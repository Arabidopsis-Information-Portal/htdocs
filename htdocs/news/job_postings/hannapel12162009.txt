Full Description:? A postdoctoral research associate position is available
immediately to join a multi-disciplinary team at Iowa State University,
Ames, IA, investigating the mechanisms that regulate long-distance movement
of full-length mRNAs in plants. Focus is on the identification of
RNA-binding proteins that regulate RNA stability, movement, and translation
repression. The position is in the lab of Dr. David Hannapel, Plant Biology
Major. The overall objective of this NSF-funded project is to uncover the
network of RNA signals and protein chaperones that are responsible for the
photoperiod-activated signaling that induces tuber formation in potato.
Several approaches will be undertaken to identify and characterize mRNAs and
proteins from phloem, including the profiling of RNA expression, proteomics,
and RNA/protein binding assays. This position will focus on novel approaches
utilizing RNA or protein bait to identify complexes that regulate RNA
metabolism. Candidates must have a strong background in RNA biology. Salary
will be commensurate with qualifications. Iowa State University is an
affirmative action, equal opportunity employer. See also: Banerjee et al.,
2006, Dynamics of a mobile RNA of potato involved in a long-distance
signaling pathway. Plant Cell 18: 3443, for more details.
