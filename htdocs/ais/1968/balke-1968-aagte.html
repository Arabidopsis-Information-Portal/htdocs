<h2>Embryo test without seed loss</h2><p>

For MULLER's embryo test seeds are scored for mutations 2 or 3 days
before the seedcoat turns brown.  I found that seeds of unopened
siliques of this age germinate in about 14 days when the siliques are
placed on agar (with a trace of KNO3, in light, 24*degrees*C) give
over 95% germination. Green seed germinates after 11-12 days, whereas
brown (almost ripe) seed takes 15-16 days. Cold treatment (3 days,
2*degrees*C, dark) after sowing retarded germination in both cases.
Seeds sown in this way after the embryo test can give additional
information on chlorophyll mutations scored at the seedling stage, and
can be used to raise M2 plants for further studies.<p>
