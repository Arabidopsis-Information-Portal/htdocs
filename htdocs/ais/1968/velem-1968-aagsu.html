12 different nitrosoamines were applicated on seeds of Arabidopsis,
Dijon (24 hrs, 25*degrees*C) and their mutagenic activity was
evaluated according to the frequency of siliquae segregating embryonic
and chlorophyll recessive lethals = mb (MULLER, 1963).  Mutagenic
active (table) were ethylvinylnitrosamine (EVN) and further
nitrosoamines, with at least one methyl group on the side chains and
with at least one hydrogen atom bound on the alpha-C-atom.  EVN is
known as an unstable nitrosamine which is able to hydrolyse, whereas
other active nitrosoamines are known as stable ones, decomposing only
enzymatically (see DRUCKREY et al., 1967).  It could be assumed that
the seeds of Arabidopsis contain enzymes, specifically decomposing
only nitrosamines with a methyl group.<p>
