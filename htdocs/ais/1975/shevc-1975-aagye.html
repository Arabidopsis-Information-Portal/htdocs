The aim of this study is to find out that the initials of the main and
lateral first order inflorescences of the shoot apex of A. thaliana
seedlings which have developed one pair of leaves are the same.<p>

Nine day old seedlings of A thaliana (race En) grown on minimal agar
medium in Petri dishes were irradiated by 1, 3 and 5 kr *gamma* rays.
Then the seedlings with the first pair of leaves were transplanted
into soil. They were grown there under continuous illumination at
24*degrees* +/- 2 *degrees*C.  Both control and 1 kr-irradiated plants
began to flower on the 32nd day after sowing, 3 and 5 kr ones on the
34th and 35th day respectively.  Using MULLER's embryo test
chlorophyll deficient mutants were scored irrespectively whether their
embryos were of normal size or somewhat undeveloped.  20 pods were
scored on the main inflorescences and not less than 5 pods on the
lateral ones.<p>

Table 1: Correlation between normal and mutant pods in inflorescences
of different order in mutants of A. thaliana<p>

The data obtained after studying the effect of all doses were
summarized in Table 1.  Of 144 plants 14 showed mutations
(8.4+/-2.16%).  Mutations found out in the different inflorescences of
a plant were identical. As can be seen in the table 20.8+-2.42 mutant
pods were observed on the main inflorescences and 21.0+/-1.23% on the
lateral ones formed in the axils of cauline leaves.  Lateral
inflorescences formed in the rosette leaf axils contained 12.4+/-1.93
mutant pods. The data obtained show that there were a few initial
cells for generative tissues (about 5-8) in the shoot apex of the
seedlings having one pair of leaves.<p>

Results being available in literature in respect to irradition of
seeds of A. thaliana and other plants (including data obtained when
studying dose dependence) indicate that in the shoot apex of a seed
there are only 1 to 3 initial cells giving the material for generative
tissues (GRINIKH et al., 1974).  If these calculations are right it
can be supposed that in our experiment initial cells divided not more
than 1 to 2 times for a 9-day period after sowing.<p>
