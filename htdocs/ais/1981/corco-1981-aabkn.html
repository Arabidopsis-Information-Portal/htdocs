DES is a monofunctional alkylating agent that has been shown to induce
mutations and other genetic alterations in a diversity of organisms
(Hoffmann, 1980). Induction of mutations by DES affecting the
morphology of Arabidopsis thaliana (variety Columbia) was reported by
Harle (1972). Changes in variances, means, skewness, kurtosis with
respect to flowering time and plant weight were reported by Brock
(1976) for the M2 generation derived from plant (variety Estland)
which have been DES mutagenized as seeds.<p>

Being interested in photoperiodism and the development of flowering we
thought it would be interesting to use DES as a mutagenic agent. We
treated seeds of the Columbia variety in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks
containing 100 ml of distilled water to which was added 0.5 ml of
diethyl sulfate. A similar control sample was treated without DES.
Because DES is not easily dissolved, the flasks were agitated on a
horizontal shaker for one hour. The seeds were then washed with
distilled water six times. This method is the one used by Harle
(1972). Seeds were put in small test tubes containing a mineral medium
and set under constant light.<p>

Results among the M 1.<p>

Germination was not affected by the treatment since 111 out of 114
seeds germinated (97.3%). Among the control, 40 out of 40 germinated.<p>

The control plants flowered 19 days after germination. So did 38 of
the treated plants, however, 71 did not flower by that time and 5 had
died.<p>

The control plants produced seeds 56 days after germination. So did
the 38 nondelayed plants. Among the delayed ones, 24 had flowered by
that time, but the plants were small. The other plants died without
flowering.<p>

Results among the M2<p>

Six M 1 plants which had seeded were tested for DES effect on their
progeny.<p>

Table 1: Germination results of the M2 plants.<p>

Germination of the M 2 plants has been seriously affected by the
treatment with DES (Table 1). The size of the M 2 plants was in
general smaller than the controls. Only among the progeny of M 1
plants 4, 5, and 6 were normal sized plants. These results are similar
to Brock's results. He stated that "the M 2 population had
significantly lower mean plant weight". In view of the very low
germination rate of our M 1 seeds we have decreased the concentration
of DES to 0.15% in our present experiments.<p>
