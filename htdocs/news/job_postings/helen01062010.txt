An INRA financed position is available to work with Helen North on the
study of the role of cellulose and its synthesis in Arabidopsis seed
mucilage. Work in the group aims to identify key genes required for
the synthesis and release of seed mucilage (Macquet et al. Plant Cell
2007). Recent results have shown that Arabidopsis seed mucilage is
composed of different layers and domains the most internal of which
contains cellulose (Macquet et al. Plant Cell Physiol. 2007). The post-
doctoral researcher will use mutants and gene reporter constructs to
identify which cellulose synthases are required to produce this
cellulose and carry out functional analysis to determine its
contribution to mucilage structural organisation. The Jean-Pierre
Bourgin Institute (IJPB) is based on the INRA Versailles site. This
recently created Institute comprises around 190 permanent staff and
100 non-permanent lab members. The position is open from the 1st of
April 2010 with a starting salary  a PhD degree and be experienced in plant genetics, molecular
biology and biochemistry. Previous work in the domain of plant
polysaccharides would be an advantage. Applicants should send a
curriculum vitae including the names and addresses of two referees,
and a cover letter to helen.north@versailles.inra.fr or Dr Helen
North, Institut Jean-Pierre Bourgin, UMR1318 INRA-AgroParisTech,
