Vol 01:<h2>RATCLIFFE, D.</h2><h2>Observations on the physiology of flowering</h2>

In the last few years strains of Arabidopsis have been collected from
various parts of the British Isles, particularly Scotland, for some
visual observations on their flowering physiology.  The main
difference between the strains is the length of cold treatment of
germinating seeds necessary to induce normal flowering; that is,
fairly rapid flowering under high light intensity, long days,
reasonably high temperatures.  If a short period (3-4 weeks) of
vernalisation is given the strains vary very much in the length of
time to the appearance of flowers and the size of the plant at
flowering time.  These differences show a general correlation with the
climatic conditions of the area of origin: the strains from warmer
areas flower more readily than those from colder areas.<p>

All British strains obtained are winter annual and as far as the
author knows no summer annual strains have been found in Britain. The
author has in his possession reasonable quantities of seed of about 25
strains mostly from Britain but also from France and Spain (strains
from the latter countries also seem to be winter annual).<p>

It might be suggested that Arabidopsis from western and north western
Europe is likely to be winter annual, since these areas have a maximum
of rainfall during (usually) a mild winter, and that Arabidopsis from
central Europe, with more extreme winters and a summer maximum of
rainfall, will usually be summer annual.<p>

Vol 01:<h2>HIRONO, Y.</h2><h2>Utilization of the increased vigor obtained through prolongation of the vegetative stage</h2>

Under the standard culture conditions in Columbia (continuous
illumination) many weak mutants fail to produce satisfactory amounts
of seed and crosses are rarely successful.  Short day treatment (8 hrs
daily illumination) help to overcome these difficulties.  The transfer
of these genes, causing poor viability, to a late genetic background
is even more helpful.  Generally they then produce good pollen which
makes the crosses feasible and set enough seed to carry out all kinds
of genetic analyses.  As an example: ch 1 mutant yields generally only
a few hundred seeds under continuous illumination; ch 1 gi 2 double
mutant, however, gave a seed output of several thousand.  Mutant pa
can hardly be used as the female in crosses, but gi 2 pa is an
excellent female or male parent.<p>
