INTRODUCTION<p>

Recently Sree Ramulu and Sybenga (1979) described a number of
translocations in Arabidopsis thaliana induced by fast neutrons (Nf)
and X-rays. The translocations were selected on the basis of the
semi-sterility of translocation heterozygotes, and the subsequent
cytogenetic identification was based on the occurrence of multivalents
in meiosis of such heterozygotes. Due to the small size of the
chromosomes and the relatively insignificant differences between
chromosomes of Arabidopsis, it was not possible to identify
cytologically the chromosomes involved in the translocations. In
general, genes located on translocation chromosomes show linkage with
the translocation. In this report results are presented that show the
identificiton of the chromosomes involved in some translocations of
Arabidopsis by the analysis of linkage between characteristic markers
and semi-sterility in translocation heterozygotes.<p>

MATERIAL AND METHODS<p>

In the course of research on the comparison of fast neutrons and
X-rays with respect to genetic effects accompanying chromosome
aberrations, a total of 60 translocations have been induced and
analysed for homozygous viability in Arabidopsis thaliana var.
Landsberg erecta (2n=10) (Sree Ramulu and Sybenga, unpubl.). The
charactristics of some translocations used from this group for genetic
identification are presented in Table 1. Among these translocations,
T7 showed deviation of fertile to semi-sterile plants from the
expected 1:1 ratio, the semi-steriles being significantly lower than
the fertiles. However, as revealed by the data obtained from a
different set of experiments (Sree Ramulu and Sybenga, unpubl.), T7
showed a variable segregation ratio of fertiles to semi-steriles. The
progeny of T14 heterozygotes invariably segregated for a pale green
chlorophyll mutant (denoted tentatively at ch-x), which was always
fertile indicating close linkage with the translocation.<p>

segregation of the progeny of translocation heterozygotes into fertile
and semi-sterile plants.<p>

Semi-sterility was determined by assessing ovule sterility and/or
pollen stainability (Sree Ramulu and Sybenga, 1979), the latter method
used mainly to check plants in which scoring of ovule sterility gave
problems. Genic male-sterile plants (ms) were pollinated abundantly
with wild type pollen to determine ovule sterility.<p>

Translocation homozygotes or heterozygotes were crossed with genotypes
homozygous recessive for a number of independently segregating genes.
In the F1's the translocation hetrozygotes were identified as
mentioned above. Test crosses were made with genic male-sterile (ms)
testers only. The marker genes used in the present experiments were an
(angustifolia, narrow leaves, chrom.1); py (pyrimidine requiring,
chrom.2); gl-1 (glabra, hairless, chrom.3); cer-2 (eceriferum,
waxless, chrom.4) and ms (male sterility, chrom.5). More details on
the phenotype and the exact location of these markers are described by
Koornneef et al. (1983). The genes occupy a more or less central
position on their chromosome with the exception of an, which lies at
the end of the long chromosome 1 (total 123 cM) and ms, which is
located at position 26 of the 98 cM logn chromosome 5.<p>

Recombination fractions between fertility and markers were estimated
by using the maximum likelihood formulae developed by Kramer (1954).
For the estimation of recombination fractions between markers the
product ratio was applied (Stevens, 1939).<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

The data on linkage of markers with fertility (Table 2) and the
observation of linkage between markers previously segregating
independently (Table 3), clearly allow the identification of the
chromosomes involved in the translocations T5, T7 and T10. They are
chromosomes 3 and 4 for T5, chromosomes 2 and 3 for T7 and chromosomes
2 and 4 for T10.<p>

The data for T3 are clear with respect to chromosome 3 (gl-1). The
other chromosome involved is very probably 5 as the linkage of ms with
fertility is slightly significant in the F2, while linkage between
gl-1 and ms is strongly significant. The deviation from independent
segregation observed in the test cross of T3 with py is not in the
direction of linkage and can not be explained so far.<p>

As T14 is concerned, the chromosomes 2 and possibly 5 are involved
(Table 3). A location of a breakpoint far from a marker may result in
loose linkage or even independent segregation. This may be expected
especially with distal markers like an and ms when the breakpoint is
near the other end of the chromosome, even though recombination is in
general suppressed in a translocation quadrivalent.<p>

The absence of semi-sterile chlorophyll recombinants in the selfed
progeny of plants heterozygous for translocation T14 and for the
chlorophyll mutant xh-x indicates close linkage of the gene and the
translocation. As this mutation was induced together with the
translocation, this might be an example of absolute linkage with the
translocation viz. at a breakpoint.<p>

The present study on the genetic identification provides an additional
evidence to the cytological determination of interchange hetrozygotes
(Sree Ramulu and Sybenga, 1979).<p>

Secondly, it shows the possibility to use these translocations to
associate genes with particular chromosomes by using the
semi-sterility character without the need for karyotype analysis.<p>

The use of translocations offers some advantages over trisomics as
they are vigorous and at least partly fertile which makes them easier
to work with than some trisomics (Koornneef and van der Veen, 1978).
Furthermore a minimum of 3 translocation testers is necessary for
Arabidopsis compared to a minimum of 4 trisomics. An useful tester-set
may be the translocations T3, T7 and T10 (Table 4). One may encounter
problems when using translocations to map genes on chromosomes when
the marker is too far from the translocation breakpoint, and when the
mutant gene interferes with the scoring of sterility.<p>
