<h2>Occurrence of oligo- or apetaly and other malformations in Arabidopsis flowers as a result of phenylboric acid (PhB) treatment</h2><p>

	As shown in previous publications (HACCIUS et al., 1959-1966), a single PhB-treatment of plant vegetative points produces severe malformations or total inhibition of only those organs which were in the earliest induction stage at the time of treatment.  The present communication deals with flower abnormalities in Arabidopsis thaliana as a result of PhB-application. The same effect can not be obtained by using boric acid solutions.<p>

	The seeds of A. thaliana (race Stockholm) used in our experiment were kindly placed at our disposal by Prof. Dr. K. KNAPP-ZINN (Grenoble).  One drop (0.1 ml) of a 300 ppm solution of PhB was placed on the shoot apex of young plants at the early rosette stage.  Influorescences of treated as well as of untreated plants were collected and examined.  In the former, the frequency of flowers with a reduced number of floral parts was striking.<p>

	Microscopal observations of more than 100 anomalous flowers yielded the following results (S  sepals,  P  Petals,  St  stamens,  G  gynoecium):<p>

t r i p e t a l y = S 4;  P 3;  St 2+4, 1+4 or 0+4;  G 2 (Fig. II) was found in 37% of the examined anomolous flowers,
d i p e t a l y = S 4;  P 2;  St 2+4, 1+4 or 0+4;  G 2 (Fig. III) in 27%,<p>

m o n o p e t a l y = S 4;  P 2;  St 2+4, 1+4 or 0+4;  G 2 (Fig. IV) in 16%,<p>

a p e t a l y = S 4;  P 0;  St 0+4 or 1+3;  G 2 (Fig. V) in 5% and<p>

t r i m e r y = S 3;  P 3;  St 2+3;  G 2 or 3 (Fig. VI) in 15%.<p>

	In 3 flowers one carpel was open with the ovules exposed and 21 flowers possessed a pistil with only one functioning carpel.<p>

	McKELVIE (1962) in his list of mutant genes in A. thaliana describes 3 mutations with apetalous flowers (angulosa-2, apetala and clausa), and 3 mutations with a reduced number of petals (grandiflora-1, languida and serrata-1).  Hence, this is our third case of PhB induced malformations simulating well-known mutations:  (1)  lanceolate leaf in tomato (HACCIUS and GARRECHT, 1963), (2) tripistilly and pistilloidy in Pisum (HASSIUS and WILHELMI, 1966), and (3) oligo- or apetaly in Arabidopsis.<p>

	MATHAN (1965, 1966), as a consequence of his biochemical investigations on normal and on lanceolate tomato plants, concludes that the primary action of PhB as well as of the lanceolate gene "is to cause the increase in the level of activity of four oxidative enzymes and the latter in turn, among other factors, determine the shape and size of the leaf in tomato".  However, the question arises if it is probable that the same biochemical mechanism accounts for gene induced lanceolate leaves in tomato as well as for flower mutations in Pisum and Arabidopsis.<p>
