<h2> Attempted callus culture of spontaneous callus-forming albino mutant</h2><p>

A mutant stock derived from Professor ROBBELEN has the Gottingen
identification number V52.  Phenotypically this mutant is identical
with the mutant im and we have considered it to be the same mutant as
im.*<p>

*Recent crossing data confirm this assumption (ROBBELEN, 1968)<p>

It was observed that our seed stock showed a marked tendency toward
abnormal or callus growth.  In 14% glucose supplemented mineral agar
under incandescent white light (2600 microwatts/cm2/sec).  Since in
experiments on the control of chlorophyll formation it would be
desirable to have large amounts of material, and since seeds of albino
V52 are difficult to obtain, culturing of the spontaneously formed
calluses was attempted.  It was hoped that with the addition of growth
factors the calluses could be grown very rapidly.  The experiments
reported by LOEWENBERG (1965) ZIEBUR (1965) and SHEN-MILLER and SHARP
(1966) were used as a guideline in determining which media to try.<p>

Materials and Methods.  For callus growth 50 ml of each of the
following media was placed in each of two 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks:<p>

(1)	Basic nutrient medium for Arabidopsis: Mineral salts (M) + 1%
glucose + 0.78% agar<p>

A	Basic medium + 1-% coconut milk by volume<p>

B	Basic medium + vitamin solution (V) + amino acid solution (A)<p>

C	Basic medium + kinetin (0.64 mg/l) + Indole acetic acid (2
mg/l)<p>

AB	Basic medium + coconut milk + vitamins + amino acids<p>

BC	Basic medium + vitamins + amino acids + kinetin + I.A.A.<p>

AC	Basic medium + coconut milk + kinetin + I.A.A.<p>

ABC	Basic medium + coconut milk + vitamins + amino acids + kinetin
+ I.A.A.<p>

In one flask of each type of medium was placed a piece of callus from
a V52 plant; on the other, an excised hypocotyl from a wild-type
plant. The callus tissue was obtained from two 32-day-old albino
V52 plants grown aseptically on glucose-mineral agar in continuous
white light; the hypocotyls were excised from approximately
one-week-old seedlings of wild-type Arabidopsis grown under the same
conditions. The flasks were then placed in continuous white light and
observed periodically for growth.<p>

The composition of the used solutions was as follows:<p>

Observations: Only one of the hypocotyls showed significant growth-the
one cultured on medium (1). From this hypocotyl was regenerated a
whole new plant, or cluster of several plants, which flowered and set
seed.  Hypocotyls grown on A and B grew short roots from one end, but
showed no further growth.  All of the hypocotyls (except (1))
eventually turned brown and shrunk somewhat in length.<p>

All of the calluses grew quite slowly.  Most of them, however, did not
remain undifferentiated but started to proliferate albino leaves.
Callus tissue cultured on AB was the only one to remain
undifferentiated throughout the six weeks of the experiment.  Only
tissue grown on B produced roots as well as leaves.  -Two of the
"calluses" - (1) and B- started to grow quite quickly about 25 days
after planting, when the agar was beginning to dry out somewhat.<p>

Each piece of tissue was about 2mm in diameter at the start of the
experiment, each hypocotyl was approximately 5mm in length when
planted.  Final measurements, made six weeks after planting, were as
follows:<p>

Discussion: The results of the experiment on callus growth show that
the tissue on (1) -with no organic additives-and on B-with vitamins
and amino acids added-grew the best.  That the coconut milk-known to
contain plant growth factors-and kinetin and IAA produced no
acceleration in growth, but actually inhibited growth as compared to
the control, would seem to indicate that these spontaneous calluses
produce their own growth hormones.<p>

Since the growth of tissue on (1) and B was accelerated after around
25 days, when a fair amount of water had evaporated from the agar, it
is speculated that high osmotic pressure will speed the growth of the
tissue. To test this speculation, an experiment is now in progress in
which the "callus" tissue from this experiment has been subcultured
onto media with higher osmotic pressures, due to either the glucose,
the mineral salts, or both.<p>

Evidently, none of the media were able to induce the wild-type
hypocotyl tissue to form callus, demonstrating that this tissue is
quite different from the V52 spontaneous calluses, as assumed.  Yet
the regeneration of an entire plant from the hypocotyl on (1) shows
the remarkable regenerative capacity of this tissue.<p>
