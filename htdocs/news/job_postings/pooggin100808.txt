Postdoc and PhD student positions are available at the Institute of Botany, University of 
Basel, Switzerland, to study the relationship between viruses and the plant RNA silencing 
machinery. The project is funded by Swiss National Science Foundation. We are looking 
for a motivated and hard working young scientist with a solid background in molecular 
plant virology, basic skills in biochemistry, experience with RNA work including small 
RNA blot hybridization, and a deep interest in RNA silencing and viruses.
