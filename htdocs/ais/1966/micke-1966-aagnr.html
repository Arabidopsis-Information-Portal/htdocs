	Experiments have been performed to test the influence of storage in air, in oxygen, or in nitrogen on the germination of Arabidopsis seeds. Two types of seeds were used for these experiments:<p>

	A:  Arabidopsis thaliana, race En-2, harested one year ago,
	B:  Arabidopsis thaliana, race En-2, harvested immediately before these experiments.  The seeds of group B, therefore, were within the period of dormancy, at the beginning of the experiment.  These seeds have been brought into the different storage conditions (desiccators) for a period of 10 weeks. The germination has been tested by sowing the seeds on soil and counting the numbers of emerging seedlings 8 and 21 days resp. after sowing.<p>

	The results are summarized in the Table.  Column 1 shows the germination percentages 8 days after sowing.  It can be seen, that the germination of the freshly harvested seeds was not higher than 3.3% against 63.2% for the old seeds ("unstored").  The storage of the old seeds under laboratory conditions increased the germination to about 70%, but gave no significant differences by the different atmospheric conditions.  On the contrary, the storage of freshly harvested seeds in either air, oxygen or nitrogen led to consistent differences.  The germination was highest after storage in 02 and lowest after storage in N2.  If the germination is tested by counting the seedlings 3 weeks after sowing, no differences between the number of seeds from the different storage can be seen.  Apparently the storage affects only the speed but not the ability of germination.  As there is no delayed germination visible after storage of old seeds in N2, we assume that the effect of storage in different atmospheric conditions is due to interacactions with the phenomenon of seed dormancy.  From these experiments it may be reasonable to conclude, that oxygen storage shortens the seed dormancy whereas lack of oxygen leads to a prolongation of seed dormancy.<p>
