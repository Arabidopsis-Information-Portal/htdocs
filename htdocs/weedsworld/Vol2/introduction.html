Dear Arabidians <P>

Welcome to the second issue of Weeds World! As you can see this issue
is twice the size of the first one. This is thanks to your 
support in sending in articles for publication. <P>

Weeds World has now been registered and has the ISSN 1358-6912.<P>

Since the last issue I have tried to clarify the situation whether publishing in Weeds World will lead to problems if the same information is subsequently submitted for publication in standard journals, by contacting all the major journals. As yet, I have had one reply, which stated that the journal did not have a policy regarding electronic publishing of information. Apparently, at the moment there is not a clear or standard policy amongst the journals. All copyright for items published in Weeds World remains with the authors. <P>

<B>New to this issue</B> is the ability to download the text versions of the newsletter from the anonymous ftp account at NASC. This can be done directly by selecting <A HREF="ftp://nasc.nott.ac.uk/pub/WeedsWorld">HERE</A> or by anonymous ftp to nasc.nott.ac.uk and getting the text files from the pub/WeedsWorld directory. 
 <P>
Weeds World is available from three WWW servers, one at <A href="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk:8300/home.html">
Nottingham, </a>UK, the <A href="http://weeds.mgh.harvard.edu"> AAtDB 
WWW server </A> and the <a href="http://probe.nalusda.gov:8000/otherdocs/ww/home.html">
Agricultural Genome WWW Server</a> National Agricultural Library - USDA. 
Please connect to the server nearest to you, it will give you the fastest 
connection times. In addition, the newsletter is WAIS indexed by John 
Morris and held on the Gopher server, the <A href="gopher://weeds.mgh.harvard.edu/">AAtDB Research Companion</a> at MGH, Boston, so that it can be 
searched in the same way as you can currently search <A href="gopher://weeds.mgh.harvard.edu"> AAtDB </A>, the arab-gen bulletin board postings.  <P>

If you do print off a hard copy please feel free to circulate it amongst 
your colleagues, especially if they do not have access to the Internet. The best results will be obtained by printing from the World Wide Web, but a plain text version of the Newsletter is also available on the <A href="gopher://weeds.mgh.harvard.edu/">AAtDB Research Companion</a> at MGH, Boston and by ftp from <A HREF="ftp://nasc.nott.ac.uk/pub/WeedsWorld/">NASC</A>.<P>
