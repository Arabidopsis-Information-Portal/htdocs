Postdoctoral Research Associate Position in genomics of maize shoot apical meristems.  A 
Postdoctoral Research Associate Position is available immediately for a highly motivated 
individual to work on an NSF supported position to study the genetic control of shoot apical 
meristem (SAM) architecture in maize.  The postdoc will work in a team and individually to map 
quantitative trait loci (QTL) for SAM architecture in a recombinant inbred line population, map 
expression QTL from laser captured SAMs, and to isolate genes that control SAM architecture. 
Experience in developmental biology, genomics, statistics, maize genetics, QTL detection, 
microarray analysis and bioinformatics are desirable.  Excellent oral and written communication 
skills are also desirable.
