Isozymes, or multiple molecular forms of enzymes, as resolved by
electrophoesis in gel matrices, have added a new dimension to genetic
studies. Arabidopsis thaliana provides a very suitable material for
genetic analyses in higher plants.  However, not many reports are
available in literature concerning the inheritance of electrophoretic
variants in this plant, except those by GROVER and BYRNE (1972) and
JACOBS and SCHWIND (1972).  Further to our previous report, we have
been able to study the genetics of isozyme varition at ten loci as
observed in 17 of the geographic races. These races or ecotype, form a
part of the collection maintained by the division of Plant Industry,
CSIRO at Canberra (see LANGRIDGE and GRIFFING, 1959).<p>

The details of the growth conditions and electrophoretic assays, will
be described elsewhere. Briefly, the leucine aminopeptidases (Lap),
glutatmate oxalacetate transaminases (Got), acid phosphatases (AcPh)
and esterases (Est) were extracted from rosette leaves of 13-day old
plants growing in agar medium, whereas the peroxidases (Per) were
derived from their roots.  Also, for reasons not yet clear, it was
found that Lap, Got and AcPh isozymes are best resolved in starch
gels, while polyarcrylamdide gels only gave satisfactory separation of
esterases and peroxidases.<p>

thaliana. The electrophoretic mobilities relative to the buffer front
are given for each band.<p>

Fig. 1 shows the electrophoretic variants for different enzyme systems
that we have studied so far. The relative electrophoretic mobilities
of these bands are also given. For any one enzyme system, the isozyme
variant which is the most common among the 17 geographic races, has
been called the normal (N) allele.  Other allelic variants (all
codominant) as determined by genetic analyses, are designated S (slow)
or F (fast) depending on their migration relative to the N band.  On
the basis of these analyses, it has been possible to characterize each
race at ten different isozyme loci, and these results are summarised
in Table 1. This information, combined with further analyses on
variation at other loci, would be useful for the purposes of
constructing detailed linkage maps.<p>

A word of caution should be given here.  The races or ecotypes, used
in the present study, have been maintained as single plant progenies
for a number of generations. Thus, any one race named after the place
of collection may have little resemblance with the population from
which it is sampled, and as also pointed out by REDEI (1970), the
designation of a race may have different meanings in different
laboratories. Therefore, the results reported here are good only for
our collection of race, and other research workers will be well
advised to compare their results with ours before designing any
further experiments.<p>
