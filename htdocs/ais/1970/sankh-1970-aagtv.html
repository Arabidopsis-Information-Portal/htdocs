<h2> Effect of IAA, GA, and ABA on senescence of leaf discs of Arabidopsis thaliana</h2><p>

The visible symptoms associated with leaf senescence are an
irreversible yellowing and loss of chlorophyll.  The changes are in
turn closely associated with a progressive decline in the efficiency
of the leaf tissue to synthesize new RNA and protein (OSBORNE, 1965,
1967).  It has been shown that, although the action is species
specific, the functional life span of leaf discs of various plants can
be experimentally extended by a variety of growth substances including
auxins, gibberellins, kinins and growth retardants (OSBORNE, 1965;
HARADA, 1966; KNYPL 1967).  This hormonal retardation of leaf
senescence is mediated through maintenance of DNA as a functional
template for DNA - dependent RNA synthesis (OSBORNE, 1967). Earlier we
demonstrated cytokinin regulation of senescence in Arabidopsis; the
present report indicates that the senescence of leaf discs of this
plant could also be prevented by gibberellic acid (GA).  Not only
this, gibberellic acid also reversed the senescence of leaf discs
caused by a naturally occurring, abcission accelerating, senescence
promoting, and dormancy inducing substance vis., abscisic acid (ABA)
(ADDICOTT and LYON, 1969).<p>

Since often leaves of different age groups elicit different response,
the present experiments were performed with leaf discs punched from
mature leaves (mostly obtained from 30-33 days old plants).
Chlorophyll was determined by extracting the pigment in 80% acetone
and measuring the optical density of this extract at 665 nm, while the
proteins were estimated by a modified biuret method. The results were
expressed as the net decrease during the experimental period in the
percentage of chlorophyll or protein from that initially present.
During the experimental period the leaf discs, floating on water, IAA,
ABA and on a combination of IAA and ABA, became yellow while those
floating on GA solution a well as those on GA and ABA in combination
retained their green colour.  It was found that in the control the
chlorophyll content decreased to as much as 75%, on IAA to 85%, and on
ABA to 90% (Figure a).  In contrast the leaf discs on GA lost less
than 20% of their total chlorophyll during this time.  It is
significant to note that the chlorophyll content was also maintained
to a very great extent in the discs floated on solutions of ABA and GA
in combination. The results also clearly indicated that GA delays the
degradation of the proteins (Figure b) alone as well as in combination
with ABA.  In other words, in Arabidopsis, GA not only itself acted as
regulator of senescence in leaf discs but also appreciably reversed
the senescence promoting action of ABA. Auxins did not retard
senescence, and appeared to enhance the process.<p>

Retardation of the senescence of excised leaf discs by GA has been
noted in comparatively few species (Tropeolum, Taraxacum, Rumex and a
few crop plants) only (FLETCHER and OSBORNE, 1965; BEEVERS, 1966;
WHYTE and LUCKWILL, 1966; GOLDTHWAITE and LAETSCH, 1968; MISHRA and
MISHRA, 1968). Thus Arabidopsis should also be added to the list of
the species in which senescence is regulated by GA.  Also since in
this plant cytokinins (SANKHLA and SANKHLA, 1968a, b) successfully
retard the senescence of leaf discs, this effect is not restricted to
GA alone.  In Taraxacum, GA maintained the DNA as a functional
template for DNA dependent synthesis of RNA (FLETCHER and OSBORNE,
1965).  In Tropeolum, on the other hand, RNA content declined in the
GA treated leaves wihout the onset of any visible symptoms of
senescence, thereby suggesting that only certain types of RNA are
essential for the maintenance of function, and synthesis of this
componenet may be sustained in the presence of GA (BEEVERS, 1966).
The manner in which GA treatment delayed senescence in Arabidopsis
remains to be explored.  However, in the presence of GA protein
degradation was considerably checked. Recently, OSBORNE (1967)
observed that pretreatment of leaf discs with ABA reduced the
subsequent incorporation of 14C-leucine into protein.  We have
observed that ABA also inhibits incorporation in RNA (SANKHLA, 1970).
Thus, in view of the above results, it would appear possible that GA
probably reverses the senescence accelerating effect of ABA by
exerting its influence on protein and RNA synthesis.<p>
