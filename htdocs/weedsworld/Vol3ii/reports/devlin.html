The environmental responses section brought together speakers from a range of disciplines. In particular, the session reflected mostly the current dynamism within the field of photomorphogenesis.  One talk was on cold-tolerance.
<p>
<A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Norwich/sessions/S58.html" target="_top">Xing-Wang Deng</A> from Yale University, chairing the session presented the latest results from the work in his lab focusing on the interactions between the various elements involved in the regulation of light-responsive genes. Mutants deficient in one or more of the <I>COP</I> proteins display constitutive photomorphogenesis. A number of <I>COP</I> genes have been cloned which has allowed an impressive analysis of the interactions between the various <I>COP</I> proteins. Several of the <I>COP</I> proteins <I>(COP8</I>, <I>COP9</I> and <I>COP11</I>) have been demonstrated to be part of  a larger nuclear-localised complex, whilst another, <I>COP1</I>, has been demonstrated to interact with the <I>HY5</I> protein, a putative trans-acting factor implicated in the phytochrome / blue-light receptor signal transduction pathways (see also <A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Norwich/sessions/S65.html" target="_top">Oyama's</A> talk below). Interestingly, a functional GUS-<I>COP1</I> fusion protein has shown that <I>COP1</I> is localised in the nucleus darkness but excluded from the nucleus in light. Several of the <I>cop</I> mutations (<I>cop8-15</I>) affect this nuclear localisation of <I>COP1</I> suggesting that this may hold the key to the <I>cop</I> phenotype.
<p>
A second group of proteins involved in the suppression of light-activated genes were discussed by <A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Norwich/sessions/S58.html" target="_top">M. Chatterjee</A> from Joanne Chory's lab at the Salk Institute. The <I>DET</I> proteins (de-etiolated) add weight to the view that the transduction of the light signal involves a "complex network of interactive signalling components". Mutants deficient in <I>DET1</I> also appear to posses aberrant circadian rhythms suggestive of a disruption of the input to the clock. The mutation <I>ted1</I> suppresses <I>det1</I> and analysis of <I>ted1</I> may provide further insight into the role of <I>DET1</I>. Research into the function of the <I>DET2</I> protein has already yielded results. <I>DET2</I> encodes a steroid 5a-reductase brassinosteroid biosynthesis enzyme and it has been demonstrated that the <I>det2</I> phenotype can be rescued by exogenous application of brassinolide.
<p>
<A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Norwich/sessions/S60.html" target="_top">Steven Streatfield</A>, also from Joanne Chory's lab, presented analysis of one of a group of positive regulators of light inducible genes. Induction of <I>CAB</I> expression by red, blue or white light is reduced in <I>cue1</I> mutants. The <I>CAB</I> under-expression phenotype of <I>cue1</I> involves an interaction with the proximal region of the CAB promoter which is known to confer light regulation on the <I>CAB</I> gene. DNA-binding activity within the <I>CAB</I> promoter is currently being compared in wild-type and the <I>cue1</I> mutant.
<p>
<A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Norwich/sessions/S61.html" target="_top">My own talk</A> focused on my work in Gary Whitelam's lab at Leicester University on the perception of the light signal or, more specifically, the roles of the various phytochrome species involved. Analysis of mutants that are null for phytochome A and phytochrome B has revealed that these two phytochromes have discrete but overlapping roles in the regulation of photomorphogenesis. The <I>phyA</I>, <I>phyB</I> double null mutant still displays several phytochrome-mediated responses suggesting regulation by phytochrome C, D or E. Specifically I have demonstrated that phytochrome action is required for the rosette habit of <I>Arabidopsis</I> and that a novel phytochrome (C, D or E) controls internode elongation and flowering time. A mutant deficient in this novel phytochrome is predicted to be early flowering and to possess elongated internodes. Mutant screening in the <I>phyA, phyB</I> double background has yielded several mutants which have this phenotype and which also lack some additional phytochrome-mediated responses. Finally, the phenotype of a new mutant <I>gn7</I>, the result of a large deletion including the whole of the <I>PHYC</I> gene was described.
<p>
<A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Norwich/sessions/S62.html" target="_top">Gareth Jenkins</A> from Glasgow University presented an analysis of the promotion of chalcone synthase expression (<I>CHS</I>) by blue and UV light. <I>CHS</I> induction involves distinct blue/UV-A and UV-B pathways. Studies with the <I>hy4</I> mutant indicate that the <I>CRY1</I> photoreceptor mediates the response to blue/UV-A but not UV-B. Blue and UV-A light were shown to act synergistically with UV-B to promote <I>CHS</I> expression. Experiments on <I>CHS</I> induction in cell cultures indicate that induction by blue, UV-A and UV-B involves protein phosphorylation and release of calcium from internal stores. However, the calmodulin antagonist W7 blocks UV-B induction but not blue induction. A screen for mutants with altered <I>CHS</I> expression was outlined. One such mutant, <I>icx1</I>, with increased <I>CHS</I> expression has been previously described. A similar mutant was introduced which demonstrates increased pigmentation and an increased tolerance to UV-B with respect to DNA damage.
<p>
<A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Norwich/sessions/S63.html" target="_top">Dave Somers</A> from Steve Kay's lab at Virginia University gave the first of two talks on the genetic analysis of circadian rhythms in <I>Arabidopsis</I>. Andrew Millar, now at Warwick University, has carried out a screen for mutants with altered circadian regulation of a cab-luciferase transgene. Twenty one such mutants have been isolated. Dave's talk focused on one of these mutants <I>toc1</I> which has a short period for cab-luciferase cycling, for the leaf movement rhythm and for the stomatal conductance rhythm. <I>toc1</I> forms a strong candidate for a clock component. Cloning of <I>TOC1</I> and transgenic alteration of its expression will allow this to be tested. 
<p>
The perception of daylength, a central factor in the control of flowering time, is thought to be mediated by a circadian sensitivity to light.<A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Norwich/sessions/S64.html" target="_top"> Isabelle Carre</A> from Warwick University discussed an assay to determine whether the clock which controls overt circadian rhythms in <I>Arabidopsis</I> is also involved in the perception of daylength. Photoperiod sensitivity was examined in mutants with altered circadian rhythms. The response to a single inductive long day of different lengths was used as an indicator of photoperiod sensitivity. The <I>toc1</I> mutant flowered early in all treatments but it can not be ruled out that it has a shorter critical daylength than that used in the experiment. The <I>elf3</I> mutant is early flowering and photoperiod insensitive. <I>elf3</I> is also arrhythmic for cab-luciferase expression. It is proposed that <I>ELF3</I> forms a component of the input pathway to the clock. If so it is possible that the effect of <I>elf3</I> on flowering is independent of the effects on the clock. Similarly, leaf movement rhythms were examined in mutants with altered sensitivity to photoperiod. <I>esd4</I> is a short period mutant whilst in the <I>fun</I> mutants flowering is uncoupled from daylength. Both, however, display normal leaf movement rhythms.
<p>
<A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Norwich/sessions/S65.html" target="_top">Tokitaka Oyama</A> working with Kiyotaka Okada at Kyoto University presented an analysis of <I>HY5</I>. The <I>hy5</I> mutant, isolated by Maarten Koornneef displays a long hypocotyl in red, blue and far-red light leading to the proposal that <I>HY5</I> acts downstream of multiple photoreceptors. However, it was demonstrated here that <I>HY5</I> is involved not only in the control of hypocotyl length but also in the development and gravity responses of roots. A T-DNA-tagged <I>hy5</I> mutant was isolated independently on the basis of the abnormal root development. This allowed the cloning of the <I>HY5</I> gene which encodes a protein with basic - leucine zipper motifs suggesting that it functions as a trans-acting factor.
<p>
Another locus involved in hypocotyl elongation was introduced by <A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Norwich/sessions/S66.html" target="_top">Herman H&#150;fte</A> from INRA. The <I>procuste1</I> (<I>prc1</I>) mutant has a short hypocotyl in darkness. However, in light <I>prc1</I> displays normal hypocotyl elongation. Double mutant analysis has demonstrated that phytochrome but not cryptochrome is required for this reversal. It was concluded that two genetic pathways exist in the control of hypocotyl cell elongation. Phytochrome mediates a switch from a <I>PRC1</i>-dependent pathway acting in etiolated seedlings to a <I>PRC1</I>-independent pathway.
<p>
<A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Norwich/sessions/S67.html" target="_top">Paul Davison</A> from John Allen's lab at Lund University discussed a method for measuring chlorophyll fluorescence, an indicator of photosynthetic efficiency. A screen for mutants with aberrant chlorophyll fluorescence in response to specific light sources was described. Such a phenotype would result from an inability to adapt to specific light conditions and would provide a tool to analyse this adaptation.
<p>
Finally, <A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Norwich/sessions/S68.html" target="_top">Gary Warren</A> from Imperial College, London described several mutants unable to tolerate freezing following cold acclimation. For five of these <I>sensitive to freezing</I> (<I>sfr</I>) mutants, it was demonstrated that the phenotype is not due to the levels of sugars, fatty acyl composition or a general lack of cold-induced expression. Progress in the isolation of these <I>SFR</I> genes was presented.
