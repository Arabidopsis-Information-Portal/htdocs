<h2> A quantitative evaluation of cell temperature resistance in a wild population of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) HEYNH, and a selection line thereof</h2><p>

Cell temperature resistance has been shown to be a conservative
character of the species in plants as well as in animals (for details
see ALEXANDROV, 1964; USHAKOV, 1964).  It is strongly influenced by
changes in ploidy (ASHRAF, 1967, 1970) as well as mutation (SUKHANOVA,
1968).  This led us to investigate the quantitative variability of
this character in a wild population of A.  thaliana collected from the
suburb of Peterhof in the vicinity of Leningrad and to compare it with
the same characteristic in a selection line P-8 derived from a
population of the same locality.  The selection line was isolated by
Dr. KVITKO, Department of Genetics of the Leningrad State University,
who kindly provided verified seeds of this line.  His criteria for
selection did not include considerations of cell temperature
resistance or resistance to any other unfavourable factor.<p>

The cell temperature resistance was measured according to the method
developed by ALEXANDROV (for details and review see ALEXANDROV, 1964).
Leaf pices of the plant were infiltrated with water with the help of a
medical syringe.  They were then subjected to the high temperature in
a water thermostat for five minutes.  Under a microscope with water
immersion objective (90x) and eye-pices (7x) the temperature was
determined which stops the protoplasmic streaming after 5 min.<p>

As can be seen from the Figure the wild population and the pure line
markedly differ in their cell temperature resistance.  The
differences are not only true for the mean values (40,8*degrees* and
43,2*degrees*C for the pure line and the wild population,
respectively), but also hold for the distribution curve with a
clear-cut decrease of the variability in the pure line.  The
variability coefficient was found to be 0,87 for the selection line
and 0,99 for the wild population.  It is interesting to note that the
cell temperature resistance was affected even though the material had
never been subjected to any selection in this direction. While the
curve for the selection line realized the requirements of a normal
distribution curve, the curve for the wild population lacked a single
peak because here in spite of large sampling (75 plants) the mode
spread over several classes (from 42,8*degrees* to 44,4*degrees*C.<p>

So far very little is known on the population dispersion of this
character.  USHAKOV et al. (1963) studied cell temperature resistance
in a population of frog tadpoles; they succeeded to increase it by
high temperature treatments of the spermatozoids eliminating the less
resistant ones.  AMOSOVA et al. (1967) studied cell temperature
resistance on the basis of thermal suppression of muscle cell
excitability in Calliphora erythrocephela.  They tried both positive
and negative selection for cell temperature resistance.  The attempts
to increase the resistance through selection during many generations
failed in the end though temporary increases were recorded.  In the
negative direction, however, the selection was successful already with
three generations. The curve continued to go down and the ultimate
results were highly significant.  Finally ALTUKHOV et al. (1968)
studied cell temperature resistance in hermaphroditic and
parthenogenetic selection lines of the silk worm.  They found that
hermaphroditic lines had a higher coefficient of variability than the
parthenogenetic lines and that different selection lines differed
significantly from each other in their cell temperature resistance.<p>

Our experimental data point to the possibility that cell temperature
resistance might be linked up with characters other than those of cell
physiology and consequently demonstrate the possibility that fruitful
work can be done in searching links between resistance, morphological
characters and growth factors.<p>
