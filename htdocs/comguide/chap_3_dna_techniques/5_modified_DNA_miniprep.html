DELLAPORTA PLANT DNA EXTRACTION
(Small Scale/Single Plant)

U.S.A.)

*  RFLP mapping of genes from Arabidopsis requires the preparation of 
restrictable DNA from many individual F2 plants or F3 families.  We have 
routinely used the following DNA prep for this purpose.  This prep is 
based on that of Dellaporta et al (Dellaporta, S.L., Wood, J.  & Hicks, J.B. 
1983. PMB Reporter 4, 19-21).  The version described below is for 1g of 
tissue, however a 10x scaled-down version starting with a few leaves 
also works reliably and gives enough DNA for 1 or 2 tracks on a Southern 
blot.  This smaller version is carried out entirely in Eppendorf tubes.

1.  SOLUTIONS
EXTRACTION BUFFER 500 ml-1
100mM Tris pH 8 50 ml of 1M 
50mM EDTA pH 8 50 ml of 0.5M 
500mM NaCl 14.61 g 
10mM b-Mercaptoethanol 10 ul

2.  EXTRACTION

  (i) Freeze 1 g of plant material in liquid N2.  Grind to a very fine powder in 
a cooled mortar and pestle.
 *  Add liquid N2 to keep material frozen and brittle.

  (ii) Transfer powder to a 30 ml tube and add 15 ml of extraction buffer.
  (iii) Add 1 ml 20% SDS and mix thoroughly by shaking.  Incubate tube(s) 
at 65oC for 10 min.
  (iv) Add 5 ml of 5M Potassium acetate and shake.  Incubate tube(s) at 
0oC for at least 20 min.
  (v) Spin tube(s) at 25,000xg (14,500 rpm in SS34 rotor) for 20 min.  
Pour supernatant through "Miracloth" (Miracloth can be obtained from 
Calbiochem Corporation, Lajolla, CA92037, U.S.A.) filter into fresh tube 
containing 10 ml isopropanol.
  (vi) Mix and incubate at -20oC for 30 min.
  (vii) Spin tube(s) at 20,000xg for 15 min (13,000 rpm in SS34 rotor).  
Pour off supernatant and allow tube(s) to drain by inverting tube(s) on a 
paper towel.
  (viii) Redissolve pellet in 0.7 ml of 50mM Tris, 10mM EDTA, pH 8 and 
transfer to Eppendorf tube(s).  Spin in microfuge for 10 min to pellet 
insoluble debris.
  (ix) [Optional...] Transfer supernatant to fresh Eppendorf tube(s), add 
an equal volume of 1:1 Phenol/Chloroform, mix and spin in microfuge for 
10 min.
  (x) Transfer aqueous phase to fresh Eppendorf tube(s), add 1/10 
volume 3M sodium acetate (75 ul) and 500 ul isopropanol.
  (xi) Mix well and pellet DNA by brief centrifugation in microfuge.  Wash 
pellet with 1 ml of ice-cold 80% ethanol.  Dry pellet and redissolve in 100 
ul 10mM Tris, 1mM EDTA, pH 8.

 *  To restrict: use about 20 ul of the DNA prep in a large volume (100 ul+) 
and include 1mM  spermidine,  0.05% NP40, and 10 ugml-1 RNAase in
