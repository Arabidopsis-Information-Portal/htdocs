RICHARDS'S PLANT DNA EXTRACTION (Large Scale)

From Eric Richards ( formerly at Massachusetts General Hospital, 
Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.A., now at Washington University, St. 
Louis), as used by Mary Anderson (formerly at Department of 
Molecular Genetics, The Cambridge Laboratory, The John Innes 
Centre for Plant Science Research, Colney Lane, Norwich, NR4 7UJ, 
England, now at Nottingham University.)

*  This method consistently yields good quality, high molecular 
weight DNA.

1.  EXTRACTION BUFFER 100mM Tris-Cl, pH 8 100mM EDTA 
250mM NaCl 100 ugml-1 proteinase K

2.  PROCEDURE   (i) Harvest 10 to 50 g fresh plant tissue.  *  Plants 
may be placed in the dark for 1 to 2 days prior to harvest to reduce the 
starch content  in the tissues.

  (ii) Freeze tissue with liquid nitrogen and grind to a fine powder in a 
mortar and pestle.  *  Keep the tissue frozen throughout this 
procedure by occasionally adding liquid nitrogen.

  (iii) Transfer frozen powder to a 250 ml centrifuge bottle and 
immediately add 4 ml extraction buffer per gram of fresh plant tissue.  
Mix gently to disperse tissue.   (iv) Add 10% sarkosyl to achieve a final 
concentration of 1%.   (v) Incubate 1 to 2 h at 55oC.  *  The lysate 
should be clear, green and slightly viscous.  From this point on, the 
solutions  should be handled gently to reduce shearing of the DNA.

  (vi) Centrifuge lysate 10 min in a Sorvall RC3C rotor at 4,000rpm, 
4oC, to pellet debris.  Filter through "Miracloth" into Oak Ridge tubes.   
(vii) Add 0.6 vol isopropanol to the supernatant and gently mix.  A 
nucleic acid precipitate should be visible, if not place at -20oC for 30 
min.  Centrifuge 10 min in a Sorvall SS34 rotor at 8,000rpm, 4oC.   
(viii) Resuspend pellet in 9 ml TE buffer.  Incubate at 55oC to aid 
resuspension if necessary.  Add 9.7 g solid CsCl and mix gently until 
dissolved.  *  For preps over 20 g, dissolve pellet in 18 ml TE and add 
19.4 g CsCl.

  (ix) Incubate lysates on ice for 30 min.  Centrifuge 10 min at 
8,000rpm (in SS34 rotor) at 4oC.  Collect the supernatant and filter 
through "Miracloth" into fresh tubes.   (x) Add 0.5 ml of 10 mgml-1 
ethidium bromide and incubate on ice for 30 min.  *  For larger preps 
add 1.0 ml of 10 mgml-1 ethidium bromide.

  (xi) Centrifuge 10 min at 8000rpm (in a Sorvall SS34 rotor) at 4oC.  A 
very soft, large RNA pellet should form.  Filter through "Miracloth" into 
fresh tubes.   (xii) Transfer the supernatant to two, 5 ml ultracentrifuge 
tubes.  *  Use an 18 ml ultracentrifuge tube for larger preps to avoid 
overloading.   (xiii) Ultracentrifuge overnight at 50,000rpm, 15oC in a 
Beckman TV865 or TV865B rotor.   (xiv) Collect DNA band using a 
large-bore needle and syringe.   (xv) Remove the ethidium bromide 
by repeatedly extracting the collected DNA with isopropanol that has 
been equilibrated over a CsCl-saturated aqueous phase.   (xvi) Add 2 
vol water and 6 vol ethanol to the DNA solution and mix.  Incubate 1 h 
at -20oC.  Transfer to a silanised glass Corex tube and centrifuge 10 
min at 8,000rpm (in SS34 rotor) at 4oC.  The DNA may precipitate 
immediately as a single white mass, which can be collected using a 
Pasteur pipette or centrifugation.   (xvii) Resuspend pellet in TE 
buffer and reprecipitate DNA by adding 0.1 vol of 3M Na acetate, pH 
5.2,  and 2 vol ethanol.  Incubate at -20oC if precipitate is not visible 
and collect DNA by centrifugation.   (xviii) Briefly air dry the pellet and 
resuspend in TE buffer.

*  DNA yields should be between 5 and 20 ugg-1 of leaves, although 
efficiency drops with increasing amounts of tissue.
