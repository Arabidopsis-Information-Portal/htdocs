	By means of the "rescue method" presumed biochemical mutants
have been obtained as reported earlier (JACOBS, 1965).  As an amino
acid deficient type, one arginine-less mutant has been studied more
extensively.  On mineral medium, the plant showed a variegated pale
green color and during the development, death often occured.  Arginine
doses of 1 to 20 mg/100 ml of culture medium restore normal vegetative
growth.  Another but uniform viridis mutant responds to the addition
of tryptophane (0.15 to 3 mg/100 ml of culture solution) by greening
at the level of rosette leaves.  Among vitamin deficiencies, in
addition to thiamine-less mutants, para-aminobenzoic acid enhances
growth of a leaky mutant, but only in conditions of discontinuous
illumination (12 hrs of light).  Normal phenotypes have also been
obtained with addition of uracil in the case of a morpholocical mutant
with a compact rosette and narrow leaves.  Irregularity in
the response towards the concentration gradient has been noted, however,
for this mutant.  In the case of some other mutants in which the
biosynthesis of nicotinic acid, cysteine, and methionine was altered,
instability appeared through repeated sellfing.<p>
