INTRODUCTION<p>

Deleterious effects of heavy ionizing particles have been studied at
first with seeds of Arabidopsis by Fujii (1966, 1967) and Ivanov et
al. (1968) showing their killiing potentials and increasing damage
with stopping power of particles. The more thick the absorber the more
seeds were killed with carbon ions of variable energy level. At that
time, however, the available energy of heavy ions was lower (e.g., for
argon < 0.5 MeV/u) than the more than two times higher energy which we
have used recently from powerful accelerators (Bevalac, Berkeley,
Unilac, Darmstadt). Additionally, the penetration of ions through the
plant tissue can be calculated now with the aid of the Benton tables
for heavy ion ranges (Benton, 1968) so that only heavy particles are
applied permeating completely the embryonic meristems of the dry seed.
In this way the critical calculation of the absorbed energy of single
stopping heavy ions considered by Fujii (1966) is avoided. Since his
experiments have shown, the greater the stopping of power of tissues
the more serious damage resulted, we prefer the better defined terms
of particle fluences (p/cm 2) and of order rsp. mass numbers (A/Z) in
our investigations. In this way a qualified definition of the
cytogenetic target range will be obtained.<p>

On the basis of this advanced experimental conditions and improved
definition of heavy ion radiation, the lethality of Arabidopsis
induced by increasing particle fluence of [40/18]Ar 14.7 and [238/92]U
16.3 MeV/u are investigated; furthermore, the genetic type of
lethality (recessive versus dominant mutation rsp. point versus
multiple deletion) is distinguished and the target range inside the
genetic effective cells is estimated for the first time.<p>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<p>

Dry seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. wild type En-2 were
fixed on cellulose nitrate detector sheets using the adhesive Luviskol
VA64 10% in 50% aqueous ethanol solution(g/v). These foils were fixed
in Petri dishes (0 35 mm) and there exposed to heavy ion radition in a
chamber adapted to the Unilac machine (Kraft, 1980). After iradiation,
the plants (M 1) were cultivated on Redei's aseptic medium (Koller
Lampert and Kranz, 1983). Growth continued after transferring vital
plantlets to standard soil (compost/peat/sand 8:2:1 v/v/v) in a
temperature and light controlled greenhouse (20 +/- 3*degrees*C),
continuous light >3 klx). Survival rates were determined by the number
of plants in M 1-generation which yielded seeds. Embryo lethality
inside the siliques, a later genetic effect of radiation in M 2, was
determined by calculation of the ratio of defective to normal
embryogenesis inside the fruits of M 1 plants. For this, the method of
Muller (1963) was simplified and adapted to the high rate of
aberrations induced by the heavy ions as follows: The third and fourth
pod of the main stem was utilized from 50 plants per treatment;
furthermore only nondeveloped, shrunken brownish (sicca, brevis,
vana), and white yellowish (albina, xantha) seeds were determined by
opening the union line of the carpel margin with the aid of a Zeiss
stereomicroscope. Data processing was achieved by Sirius VI Personal
computer.<p>

RESULTS AND CONCLUSION<p>

Generally, among the mutagens ionizing radiation cause a relative high
frequence of DNA-strand breakage besides aberrations in the sequence
of nucleotide pairs. With x-rays it is known that at higher doses
increasing of chromosome deficiencies with larger ranges of chromosome
breakage are attained. Therefore, the more densely ionizing of heavy
particles should produce especially chromosome aberations with lethal
effects at their targets. In other words we may expect single
recessive mutations of lethal factors more often with grazes than with
hits (at low rsp. high fluence p/cm 2) of heavy ions.<p>

To test such expectations we compared the biological efficiency of
argon- and uran-ions on somatic lethality in the irradiated generation
(m 1) with generative, embryonic lethality of the offspring (M 2).
Table 1 shows the significant increase in number of lethal M 1-plants
above 10 8 p/cm 2 for Ar and 10 7 p/cm 2 for U. The threshold value of
lethality of M 2-embryos is at about one power of tens lower.<p>

of two heavy ions (Ar and U).<p>

In order to distinguish the monogenic recessive lethals produced by
the larger deficiencies of DNA-rsp. chromosome breakage, somatic
chimerism of the genetic effective cells (GECN) in the seed embryo is
considered (Table 2). For numbers of 2 to 4 of GECN per shoot apex one
recessive lethal mutation per genome will yield less than 25 percent
in M 2. Otherwise, for varying numbers of GECN mutated in one gene out
of 4 no more than 25 percent embryonic lethals can be achieved in M 2.
Thus, frequencies of at least 50.0 - 6.25 = 43.75%, in which the
subtrahent signifies the mean standard deviation of the nonirradiated
control, must be caused by a dominant lethal mutation or a homologous
delection respectively.<p>

the genetic effective cells of the embryonic shoot meristem (GECN).<p>

For separating the two classes of genetic effects of heavy ions, the
frequencies of ranks obtained for the recessive one gene-lethal
mutations (in homologous DNMA-deletions rsp.) and for the dominant
lethal mutations (homologous DNA-deletions rsp.) were plotted in a
graph (Figure 1). For the embryo lethality in M 2 of the argon
experiment, once more clear threshold values exist in the range of 5.0
to 50.0 x 10 6 p/cm 2. At this fluence rate at least one particle hit
per genetic effective cell of the embryo is expected because the
cellular diameter measured is about 50 micro m 2 which corresponds to
5.0 x 10 6 p/cm 2. Evidently the maximum damage effect of one hit is
obtained at about the target range of the diploid nucleus (10.0 x 10 6
p/cm 2) for the frequency rank of recessive lethals (in homologous
DNA-deletions rsp.) whereas for the third rank more than this maximum
value is achieved when the fluence is five times more intense, i.e.,
when one hit per 2 chromosomes, probably the homologous ones on an
average is attained.<p>

SUMMARY<p>

Effects of densely ionizing heavy ion radiation on somatic lethality
(M 1) and embryonic lethality (M 2) of Arabidopsis thaliana were
studied. With growing charge and fluence of the particles used, the
somatic lethality increases significantly with distinct threshold
values of 5 x 10 8 p/cm 2 for Ar 14,7 Ne/v/u and 5 x 10 7 p/cm 2 for U
16.3 MeV/u.<p>

The frequencies of recessive (single strand breakage of DNA) and
dominant lethal mutations (double strand breakage of DNA) were
obtained by close examination of embryonic lethality of seeds
irradiated with Ar 14.7 MeV/u. Frequencies of recessive lethal
mutations increase at lower fluences ( <=1x10 7 p/cm 2 or <=1 hit per
nucleus) than dominant lethal mutations, whereas at higher fluences
(=>x10 7 p/cm 2 or =>1 hit per 2 chromosomes) the frequency of
dominant lethal mutations exceed the frequency of recessive lethal
mutations.<p>
