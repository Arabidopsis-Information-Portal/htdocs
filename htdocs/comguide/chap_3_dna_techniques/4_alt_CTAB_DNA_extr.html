*  We routinely use this method to obtain DNA from Arabidopsis tissue.  It 
can be used with leaves, callus or whole plants grown in vitro.  The 
method was originally described by Murray & Thompson (Murray, M.G. & 
Thompson, W.F. (1980) NAR 8 (19),  4321-4325) and has been 
modified by others [Taylor, B. & Powell, A. (1982) Focus 4, 4-6. and 
Rogers, S.O. & Bendich, A.J. (1988). Plant Molecular Biology Manual 
A6. Kluwer Academic Publishers. Belgium. 1-10.]. This procedure 
allows the efficient extraction of DNA (ca. 10-40 ug DNA g-1 fresh weight 
of tissue) from relatively small (1-5 g fresh weight) tissue samples.

*  This method achieves separation of nucleic acids from 
polysaccharides by exploiting the insolubility of cetyltrimethylammonium 
bromide-nucleic complexes at low salt concentrations.  The method is 
time consuming and labour intensive.  However, it is reproducible and 
DNA is usually of good quality (high m.w. and cuts with "difficult" 
restriction enzymes).

1.  SOLUTIONS
  (i) CTAB I
20 gl-1 cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)
1.4M NaCl
100mM Tris, pH 8
20mM EDTA
(0.16% v/v 2-mercaptoethanol added immediately prior to use)

  (ii) CTAB II
100 gl-1 CTAB
0.7M NaCl

  (iii) CTAB III
10 gl-1 CTAB
50mM Tris, pH 8
10mM EDTA
CHCl3: IAA (Chloroform:isoamyl alcohol) 24:1 (v/v)

  (iv) SSC
175.2 gl-1 sodium chloride
88.2 gl-1 sodium citrate trihydrate

2.  METHOD
  (i) Weigh tissue then freeze at -70oC.
  (ii) Coarsely break-up frozen tissue then grind to a slurry in an ice cooled 
mortar with a small amount of white quartz sand.

  (iii) Transfer the homogenate to a polypropylene centrifuge tube, add 
an equal volume of CTAB I at 67oC.  Mix gently, then incubate in a water 
bath at 67oC for 15-20 min with occasional inversion. 
 *  This allows soluble nucleic acid-CTAB complexes to form.

  (iv) Remove the tube from the water bath and add 0.5 volume of CHCl3: 
IAA.  Mix gently then leave at r.t. for 10-30 min with occasional inversion.
  (v)  Spin the tube at 2,000g for 5 min at r.t.  Remove the upper aqueous 
layer containing CTAB-nucleic acid complexes to a new centrifuge tube 
(note volume).  Discard the lower chloroform phase.
  (vi) Add 1/10 volume of CTAB II and mix gently (this replaces CTAB and 
salt lost in the first extraction).  Repeat step (v).
  (vii) Add 2 volumes of CTAB III and leave undisturbed at r.t. for 1 h.
 *  The reduction in salt concentration precipitates the nucleic acid-CTAB 
complexes.

  (viii) Centrifuge as above.  Decant supernatant and allow loose white 
pellet to drain.
  *  A round or flat bottomed tube works best for this step.  Pellets 
obtained using conical tubes  are difficult to resuspend.

  (ix) Dissolve pellet in CsCl (1.05 gml-1 (w/v) containing ethidium 
bromide 0.5 mgml-1).  Heat to 67oC to aid solubilisation if necessary .
  (x) Spin in an ultracentrifuge for an appropriate period (the precise 
timing and speed will depend on the machine you have.  We use a 
Beckman Tl-100 and SN.786 vertical rotor and spin at 100,000 rpm for 5 
h).
  (xi) Visualise DNA under UV illumination.  The DNA should band in the 
middle of the tube and the RNA should pellet on the side.  Remove from 
centrifuge tube with an 18 gauge needle and 1 ml syringe.
  (xii) Extract the ethidium bromide from the solution by shaking with 
several changes of n-butanol saturated with 20 x SSC.  Dialyse against 
10mM Tris 1mM EDTA, pH 8 for at least four h at 15oC to remove CsCl.
  (xiii) Determine DNA concentration by absorbance at 260 nm then 
examine the size of the DNA on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel.

*  DNA prepared by this method can be used for restriction digests.  
Usually it cuts completely.  Occasionally we have prepared DNA which 
does not cut.  This problem can be overcome by adding spermidine 
trihydrochloride to a final concentration of 0.4mM to the restriction 
digests.  We have used DNA prepared in this way to run Southern blots.  
Amounts of DNA in the range 0.5-5 ug/track work.  TypicalIy we use 
2ug/track and expect to visualise single copy sequences by overnight
