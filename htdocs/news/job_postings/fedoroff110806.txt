A post-doctoral position is available to work on microRNA biochemistry and physiology. 
Current work is on characterizing the role of the Hyl1 complex in microRNA biogenesis 
through analysis of the proteins and in vitro and in vivo assays using purified proteins. 
Requirements:  experience in protein purification and expression in heterologous systems, 
as well as a full range of molecular cloning and plant transformation techniques; 
good spoken and written language skills; a track record in independent design and 
performance of research.
