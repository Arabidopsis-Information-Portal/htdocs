Postdoctoral Fellow - Plant reproductive genetics (apomixis) 
 
Our lab is seeking applications from highly motivated postdocs 
to work on genetics of reproduction in Arabidopsis thaliana. The successful applicant will work within a 
small team of researchers 
investigating approaches for triggering of asexual reproduction 
(apomixis). We seek enthusiastic and highly motivated candidates with excellent and proven skills in plant 
genetics, molecular biology and reproduction (as demonstrated by their publication record). We particularly 
seek candidates with experience of DIC/fluorescence microscopy, in situ hybridisation, cytogenetics, 
chromatin analysis and association/QTL mapping in Arabidopsis thaliana. Prospective applicants should 
send an e-mail outlining your research interest and motivations, including; (a) your C.V. (please list 
publications and experimental skills) & (b) contact details and e-mail addresses for 3 referees to:
