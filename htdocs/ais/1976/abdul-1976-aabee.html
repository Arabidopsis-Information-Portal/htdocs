The investigation of different types of photosynthetic apparatus
variability is one of the most important fields in the genetic aspect
of photosynthesis.  In order to describe the types of photosynthetic
membranes (ph.m.) variability it is advisable to use the new term,
"plastophenes", that means the most essential morphological plastid
structure which is the result of interaction between plastogenes and
cytoplasmic microenvironment.  Isolation of plastophenes was described
elsewhere (USMANOV et al., 1975).  Some plastophenes isolate from
Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. (a), and Chlamydomonas reinhardii (b)
are shown (Figure 1).  On the basis of our experiments and the
investigations of many other authors using plastophenes we have
analyzed phylogenetic, ontogenetic, paratypic, and mutation
variability of ph.m. from different plant taxa. The investigation
showed that the beginning from vesicular thylakoid in bacteria and
single thylakoid of blue-green and red algae ph.m. reaches its
culmination in chloroplasts of higher plants with membrane system
complication and more effective ph.m. organization.<p>

The investigation of ph.m. ontogenetic variability revealed that the
ontogeny of the most advanced ph.m. systems (in higher plants)
recapitulates the phylogeny of ph.m.. Ph.m. of different taxonomic
groups are similar to each other in the paratypic variability caused
by environmental factors. The investigation of mutational varability
of ph.m. showed that the chloroplasts of higher plants reproduct
phenetically the membrane system of the lower steps of evolution.<p>

The grand total of this investigation is summarized in a hypothetic
scheme on the evolution of ph.m. and chloroplasts, showing the
phylogenetic relationships and the unity of the evolutionary
development of different ph.m. types in plant kingdom.<p>

detailed description see the test).<p>

In Figure 2 the evolution of space organization of ph.m. is shown as a
lentil shaped spiral and exclusive circles.  These circles with the
scheme of membrane system symbolize the most characteristic features
of phylogenetic, ontogenetic and mutational variability of ph.m. from
five types of photosynthesizing organisms. The size of exclusive
circles designates the scale of changes of the microevolutionary
photosynthetic membranes taking place inside these types.<p>

Joining the exclusive "variability circle" the ascending spiral
carries away the most perfect systems of the membrane; and then joins
another circle places on the upper stage of the evolutionary spiral.
In this case the spiral symbolized the macroevolution of ph.m.<p>

The phylogenetic macrosystem of plant organisms is placed to the left
from the spiral (in dark frame-kingdom), according to TAKHTADZIIYAN
(1973) and to the right the pictures of its selected representatives
are depicted.<p>

The figures below the picture show the duration of ph.m. evolution
beginning from ancient membranes, the baceria chromatophore
organization, till to the formation of the perfect photosynthetic
apparatus of higher plants.<p>

We should like to single out that point mutations of cell genetic
systems are nearly always followed by the appearance of membrane
system types and plastophenes arranged on the lower step of the
evolutionary spiral. For such mutation it was impossible till now to
observe the appearance of principally new membrane systems which could
transform along the spiral of the chloroplasts of lower taxons to the
higher taxon ranges. Such transformations from one circle of ascending
scale to another are possible only if new genes appear in the
"evolutionary old" photosynthetic apparatus.  Possible genetic
mechanisms of new genes (DNA quantity increase per cell as a result of
gene duplication) and their role in progressive evolution has been
recently discussed in the monograph by OHNO (1970).  On the basis of
modern molecular genetics achievements we can suppose that new gene
formation in chloroplasts was performed by means of tranformation of
the fragments of exogenous genetic information: plasmids, virus,
bacteria, etc.  It seems probably that in the process of parallel
evolution the host cells choose from "populations" of given plastides
those ones which have new genes from principally new ph.mn. types.
Thus, there could appear principally new membrane system types:
vesicular bodies at Bacteriobionta, single thylakoids at Cyanobionta
and Rhodobionta, double, triple, and multiple thylakoids at
Phycobionta and multigrana at Embryobionta. All of them functionize in
harmony in their host cells.<p>
