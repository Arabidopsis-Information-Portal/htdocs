	Introduction:  The dormancy level of freshly harvested Arabidopsis thaliana seeds decreases during storage.  Since germinability is dependent upon the extent of after-ripening and the induction of secondary dormancy, the control of external factors during seed storage may be of great importance in genetic studies of dormancy.<p>

	Few germinability studies have been reported on the effects of light, temperature, or seed age on dry seeds of A. thaliana.  Low temperature storage of imbibed seeds of A thaliana increases germinability.  LAIBACH (1956) found that the germinability of 78 day old seed of A thaliana was correlated with the length of cold treatment of imbibed seeds.  Imbibed A. thaliana seeds are sensitive to light.  SHROPSHIRE et al. (1961) determined the light action spectrum for germinability in the Eastland ecotype; germination control by the phytochrome system was demonstrated.  KUGLER (1951) reported that Hannoversch-Munden ecotype seeds have an obligate light requirement for germination.  REHWALDT (1965) found that dark-stored dry seeds of the Landsberg ecotype are highly sensitive to incandescent light.  LANGRIDGE (1957) found that seeds were germinable when taken from the fruit at 12 days after fertilization, but fully ripened seeds were dormant for about two weeks.  RATCLIFFE (1961) reported that 12 weeks of afterripening was sufficient for the removal of dormancy.<p>

	The after-ripening experiments here eported were conducted to detrmine the effects of light, humidity, and seed age on seed germinability.  The experiments permitted comparisons of after-ripening patterns between the Landsberg ecotype and several closely related mutant lines.<p>

	Material and Methods:  In the first experiment, single harvests of the Landsberg ecotype and the late flowering (co), narrow-leaf (an), reduced-chlorophyll b (ch2), and the an ch2 mutant lines were collected.  The seeds were stored under light-humid conditions at 24 (+/-2*degrees*C and at a relative humidity of 55%.  The seeds were exposed to a 20 h day of 1000 ft-c white fluorescent light.  Germination tests were conducted after 2 days and after 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 weeks from the time of harvest. The seeds were imbibed with 10E-3 KNO3 and incubated in the dark at 25*degrees*C for 78 (+/-6) h (REHWALDT, 1965).<p>

	The second experiment consisted of light-dry, light-humid, and dark-humid storage treatments on aliquot samples from a single harvest of Landsberg seed. Dry storage was over indicating anhydrous CaSO4.  The other storage conditions were identical to those described in Experiment 1.  Germination tests identical to that described in Experiment 1 were made at 1, 6, and 12 weeks of seed age.  Parallel germination tests using two days of cold imbibition (7.5*degrees*C) were conducted.<p>

	Results:  The data of the first experiment are ahown in Table 1.<p>

	Table 1:  Seed germinability of the Landsberg ecotype and the mutant an, ch2 co, and an ch2 at different seed ages during after-ripening under growthroom (light-humid) conditions.  (Percent germination based on 120 seeds per sample)<p>

The an, ch2, and an ch2 mutant lines showed a greater increase in germinability during seed storage than the Landsberg ecotype.  Seeds of the co mutant were completely dormant at all seed ages.  In no case was dormancy completely removed by 12 weeks of seed storage. The highest level of germinability appears to have been reached by seeds of the an ch2 mutant line.<p>

	The data of the second experiment are given in Table 2.  For all seed storage treatments, except light-dry, germinability was increased by two days of cold treatment of imbibed seeds. The order of increasing effectiveness for afterripening is light-dry light-humid, and dark-humid seed storage.  Light-dry storage was completely ineffective for after-ripening.  A comparison of the germinability levels of the light-humid and dark-humid stored seeds shows that light exposure is inhibitory to the after-ripening process.<p>

	Discussion:  The results of these experiments show that the rate of after-ripening of Landsberg seed is dependent upon storage conditions. Dark and humid (55% relative humidity) storage conditions were most effective for after-ripening though complete germinability was not reached by 12 weeks of storage. The findings of ROBBELEN and KERSTEIN (1965) suggest that the humid storage at 55% relative humidity was near the optimum for after-ripening.<p>

	As pointed out by HONING (1930), studies involving the comparison of germinability levels of seed population should be based on specific seed storage conditions. This conclusion is supported by the results of the after-ripening experiments reported here. The striking differences in after-ripening of Landsberg seeds under different storage conditions (Table 2) and the differences between closely related lines in after-ripening under controlled conditions (Table 1) show that after ripening is influenced by environmental conditions as well as by the genetic constitution of the seed.  SEMENIUK and STEWART (1962) found that different afterripening patterns may exist between species and cultivars of Rosa as tested under two sets of after-ripening conditions. The possibility that a change in the seed storage conditions may remove or reverse apparent germinability differences between seed populations should be considered in studies involving comparisons of seed dormancy.<p>

	Summary:  A comparison of different seed storage conditions on the rate of after-ripening for Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) HEYNH. showed that dark storage was more effective than light (1000 ft-c 20 h pr day) and humid (55% relative humidity) storage was more effective than dry (over anhydrous CaSO4).  Closely related lines exhibited different after-ripening patterns.  Seeds of the narrow leaf (an), reduced chlorophyll b (ch2) and an ch2 mutant lines were less dormant than these of the Landsberg ecotype, but seeds of the late-flowering (co) mutant line remained completely dormant during 12 weeks of light-humid seed storage.<p>
