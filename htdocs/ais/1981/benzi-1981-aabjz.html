As part of an investigation on the growth and mineral nutrient
requirements of Arabidopsis in inorganic media, we have been examining
various parts of the plants using a scanning electron microscope to
reveal characteristic features found on the surface.<p>

To do this, plants are reared on a defined mineral medium as described
by Fender and Schmid (1981, this issue). At appropriate times, whole
plants or parts thereof are prepared for SEM examination by the
following method.<p>

Flowers and siliques are harvested and immediately fixed in FAA
(formalin, acetic acid, ethanol; 1:1:9) for one day. Then the tissues
are dehydrated in a graded ethanol-amyl acetate series and dried using
carbon dioxide in a Polaron Model E3000 Series 2 Critical Point Drier
Apparatus. After drying, the specimens are mounted on aluminum stubs
with silver conducting paste. The mounted specimens are coated in an
International Scientific Instruments (ISI) Model PS2 Coating Unit.
Observations are made with an ISI Alpha-9 Scanning Electron Microscope
and recorded on Ilford PanF film. Some of our illustrations are
presented in Plate 1 which contains four figures.<p>

Figure 1 illustrates the tip of a matured pistil. The stigmatic
papillae, which are quite turgid and erect in the younger state, have
matured and collapsed Several pollen grains are visible among the old
papillae; the pollen grains also have collapsed, having released their
contents in the process of pollination. On the stylar surface, below,
cuticular ridges are readily visible as are several stomates. These
also are common on the surface of the ovary (silique) as is apparent
in the adjoining figure.<p>

Figure 2 illustrates a seed in the process of maturation. The silique
has dehisced; the funiculus is still attached both to the placenta and
to the seed. The micropyle appears to be visible above the point of
attachment of the funiculus to the seed. Several stomates are visible
on the surface of the silique but no stomates are apparent on the
seed.<p>

Figure 3 illustrates a stomate on the abaxial surface of a sepal; the
anisocytic stomate contains subsidiary cells whose epidermis bears a
strongly ridged cuticle. The orientation and extent of this cuticular
ridging is made quite visible in the adjoining figure.<p>

Figure 4 illustrates a general view of the abaxial surface of a sepal.
The stomates, surrounded by their subsidiary cells and adjacent
epidermal cells (of two obvious types), are readily visible. In one
type of epidermal cell (of extreme length; in excess of 500 micro m),
the cuticular ridges are strongly oriented in the longitudinal
dimension of these cells. In the other type of epidermal cell (rather
shorter in length), the cuticular ridges are much less strongly
oriented in the longitudinal direction.<p>

While stomates are common over many epidermal surfaces in Arabidopsis
plants, and are characteristically anisocytic, extensive ridging of
the cuticle and extremely elongated epidermal cells are not so common
in the rest of the plant. There appear to be no trichomes in the
flower although they are abundant on the leaves and stems.<p>

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT<p>

Seeds (columbia wild type) used in these experiments were from stock
originally supplied through the generosity of Professor G.P. Redei of
the University of Missouri.<p>
