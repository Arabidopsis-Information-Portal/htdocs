INTRODUCTION<p>

With respect to photoperiodism A. thaliana (L.) Heynh. was defined as
a facultative long-day plant (LD) since the majority of the natural
populations are summer annual ecotypes which at moderate temperatures
develop flower primordia also in relatively short daily light periods
of 9 to 5 hours. (Laibach, 1951; Redei, 1970; Cetl, 1979). Among X-ray
mutants Redei et al. (1974) discovered a wide range of photoperiodic
responses, obligate LD-genotypes (ld 1,2) not flowering under short
day (SD) conditions 9L/15D hrs.) as well as facultative SD-genotypes
(gi 1,2) flowering under 9 hours daily illumination but growing
vegetatively under continuous light (ooL) treatment for a relative
long period 20-30 days), especially at moderate temperature
(22*degrees*C). Other mutants were distinctly earlier in SD than the
latter. Furthermore, by the Columbia research group flower as well as
fruit differentiation has been found in liquid medium containing
sucrose or glucose under complete absence of light (ooD) in all
genotypes studied including the ld mutants. Additionally, certain
halogenated deoxynucleosided, especially 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrDU) by
continuous supply at low concentrations (10E-6M) through the nutrient
medium accelerated dramatically the flowering of the variant mutant
lines except the ld genotype under SD conditions (Hirono and Redei,
1966). Later on G.P. Redei (1975) concluded from additional results of
biochemical experiments that "short periods of daily illumination
generate some unidentified flowering suppressor(s) which may, however,
decay upon prolonged exposure to light. In light the DNA nucleoside
analog may interfere with the production of the flowering inhibitor(s)
possibly through presention of transcription of the genome containing
the analog."<p>

Although the threshold intensities of the blue-far red synergism in
floral induction were well established (Brown and Klein, 1971), but
flowering proceeded in ooD, i.e., without any photoperiod and flower
differentiation was delayed by light especially of SD-cycles (Redei et
al., 1974), the precise role of light in the floral differentiation
process was not analyzed in further detail. Since, furthermore, the
genotypes mentioned above had an inductive light requirement for
germination and differentiation in liquid culture under subsequent
ooD, present information is evidently insufficient whether the
putative repressor of gene function itself is sensitive to light or it
responds to a separate photosensor system. Thus, the following
questions should be answered through further experiments:<p>

i) Are there inductive photoresponses of growth and differentiation
under liquid culture conditions?<p>

ii) Which photoperiod and/or light quality triggers the synthesis of
the putative inhibitor(s) of flowering?<p>

iii) Does the red/far red sensor system mediate the negative genetic
control of flowering?<p>

Culture: Germination conditions were as previously described (Kranz,
1977). Substrates of the in vitro experiments included the liquid
media according to Redei and Perry (1971) and to Gamborg and Eveleigh
(1968) modified only with respect to the macronutrients as follows:<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol16/vol16-pg48-fig3.gif">Click here for figure</a><p>

For the studies under in vivo conditions the aseptic standard agar
medium (Redei 1965) and the standard soil (Kranz, 1968) were used.<p>

Treatments: Inhibitor substances of gene expression as listed below
were incorporated in the standard agar medium at the range of 10E-5M.<p>

i) 6-azauracile (AU) ribosid Serva, which inhibits the RNA destruction
and de novo pyrimidine synthesis.<p>

ii) 5-bromo-2' deoxyuridine (BrDU) Sigma, the DNA nucleoside analog of
thymidine.<p>

Light treatments for red/far red induction and LD, rsp. SD
photoperiods were performed according to the earlier described
experiments (Hehl and Kranz, 1974; Krand, 1976, 1977). Treatments were
10 replicates (test tubes) and reported investigations represent the
pooled data from at least 3 separate experiments.<p>

RESULTS<p>

Experiments of our group, performed for screening the problems of
light induction mentioned above, yielded the following preliminary
results:<p>

Under in vitro condition of Gamborg's liquid medium (plus glucose 1%)
the growth and differentiation of 3 genotypes depends on the
light/dark period (L/D) as well as the red/far red induction (FR/R).
Table 1 shows that for the wildtype (+/-) 16L/8D hours is optimal
yielding strong callus as well as root and medium stem
differentiation. One of the mutant lines (im 28), however, reveals
strong stem development only after one activation by 15 min. FR plus
30 min. R at the beginning of the experiment and subsequent oo D
culture; callus and root grow best in LD conditions (16L/8D hours)
similar to +/- but to a lower extent. For the heteroallelic mutant im
247, however, root and stem growth is lowest under noninductive oo D
and LD conditions; the roots of this line develop strongest after one
photosensor activation and after that complete darkness (1xFR/R, ooD),
and its stem differentiation is also better under this experimental
condition, though both im genotypes are on the whole characterized by
lower growth in relation to the wildtype under LD conditions of
suspension culture, a finding which corresponds to their well known
damage by high doses of especially red light (Robbelen, 1968; Krans,
1979).<p>

ooD, and long day condition (16L/8D [hrs ]).<p>

Table 2: The effect of the photoperiod (continuous light oo L, resp.
long dark period 8L/16D) and the DNA-nucleoside analog
(5-bromodeoxyuridine, BrDU) on the number of leaves developed before
the first flower on the stem (n) and the number of days until visible
floral induction (d) in 3 samples of natural populations (sd-, nd-,
and 1d-ecotypes).<p>

Prolonged culture for more than 10 weeks also under both the liquid
medium of Redei and Perry (1971) and varying Kinetin and IAA
concentrations added to the suspension did not yield flowers in this
material and in the mutant lines ch1, ch2, ch3 under complete
darkness. Flower and even fruit production proceeded only subsequent
the transfer of the plants to LD photoperiods after more than 3
months. All in all the observations confirmed that flowering of our
material does not occur without any light induction.<p>

Consequently, additional experiments were carried out by our group
concerning the questionable photosensitivity of the floral inhibitor.
Precedingly, the natural European populations of the AIS-seed bank
were classified in three groups of photopriodically responsive
ecotypes (Kranz, 1976): One larger group called sd-type flowering
later under permanent LD conditions (20*degrees*C) than after cold
(3*degrees*C) and SD induction for 3 weeks at the seedling stage, a
second smaller group (ld-type) reacting reversely, and the largest
group (nd-type) where treatments of this kind make no difference in
flowering time.<p>

Subsequent to Redei's fundamental studies we were then interested to
investigate the effect of the DNA-nucleoside analog BrDU on the
flowering of selected samples of these photoperiodically responsive
ecotypes. Table 2 shows that BrDU shortens both the number of rosette
leaves (n) as well as the number of days until flowering (d) under the
experimental light regimes of ooL and 8L/16D hrs. This effect of
floral shortening is even stronger by 8 hours daily illumination in
relation to control as far as flowering is actually obtained under the
SD condition. Thus, in agreement with the earlier results of Hirono
and Redei (1966) BrDU is an effectie inducer of flowering in the
European ecotypes, too. Evidently, the number of leaves seems to be a
reliable criterion for the extent of vegetative development preceding
the appearance of flower buds; this correlation, however, is not
verified under the short photoperiods plus BrDU treatment; e.g., the
nd-ecotype having the least leaves under both light regimes flowers
earliest in oo L but latest in 8L/16D. In spite of the fact that the
physiology of the two characters corresponds to some extent, evidently
their expression depends on the inductive interaction of BrDU, the
photoperiod, and the genetic stage of the plants.<p>

Figure 1: Flowering in the ld-ecotype Pr-O (panel a) and the mutant
line ch2 (panel b) under LD conditions (14L/10D hrs.)  plus
interfering red light after the day (14 L hrs., R 15 min., lines with
x's) and during the night (4 D hrs., R 15 min., lines with filled
circles).  Control and additional treatment by DNA base analogs were
signified as; 6-AU (2x10E-5 M) dashed lines, 5-BrDU (1x10E-5 M) short
dashed lines. Control (H2O) solid lines.<p>

The next step of our studies was to analyse the effect of red/far red
light on the supposed trigger mechanisms of flowering. After sowing in
standard soil plants of the ld-ecotype Pr-O and the mutant ch2 were
treated by interfering red and far red light (15 min.) during LD and
SD photoperiods. Additionally, the shoot apex of each plant was
handled by dropping aqueous solutions of the base analog AU or BrDU
three times per week for a period of 35 days. The plants of PR-O
flower significantly earlier than ch2 under all experimental variants
showing that the second line belongs more to the nd- than to the
ld-ecotype, though both lines develop flowering buds in 50 percent of
the plants in half of that time necessary for SD photoperiods (cf.
control in Figure 1, 2). Interfering red light (R) given after 4 hrs D
of the LD night reduces the time until flowering of 50 percent of the
plants for less than a day (Figure 1). Shortening of this floral
induction by interfering FR after 4 hrs. of the SD night (Figures 2,
3) is significantly stronger than by R; i.e. 5 days a mean. The
effects of interfering R in LD and FR in SD are the same upon
treatments by BrDU but, obviously, they increase up to 12 days (cf.
ch2 in Figure 3b), which confirms that BrDU is the strongest inducer
of flowering in this experiment, too. Furthermore, recent experiments
under in vitro condition of the aseptic solid medium have shown that
in agreement to Hirono and Redei's observation the BrDU effect could
be nullified by thymidine, the normal nucleoside of DNA. The analog
AU, however, induces variable interactions in this respect; whereas
this substance prolongs the time until flowering of the ld-ecotype
Pr-O for about one day under both light regimes in relation to control
(cf. Figs. 1a, 3a) weak shortening occurs in the mutant line ch2 (cf.
Figs. 1b, 3b). In this respect an additional observation of our group
is noteworthy. AU causes significant foliation but not at all
flowering of the mutant im 52, and floral induction failed also in
For-1, an extreme sd-ecotype, upon all the treatments of this
experiment. Thus, the results obtained with AU reveal the gene control
of the light x inhibitor interaction.<p>

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION<p>

Since the general problem of the flower differentiation was discussed
in detail by Redei et al (1974) the vast amount of literature can be
restricted in order to make room for the most significant arguments of
recent studies. As it was already pointed out there (cf. pgs.
143-144), much uncertainty exists about the mode of light action.
Although the evidences for flowering, i.e., no inhibition of floral
initiation in continuous darkness, seem to be convincing the precise
role of light induction in the whole process is nevertheless open for
further discussion.<p>

Summarizing the preliminary findings of our experiments we come back
to the introductory questions. From the data of suspension culture
experiments we may assume that flowering of the genotypes studied does
not occur without light induction, a finding which is contrary to that
of the Columbia group. Alternately, we are getting our first results
that R/FR mediated photoresponses of vegetative growth and
differentiation proceed under liquid culture. However, the result does
not necessarily imply that the generative process of differentiation
needs no further light induction. With our material of variant
ecotypes and mutant lines flowers and even fruits appeared only
subsequent the transfer from the dark to LD photoperiods.<p>

More complete evidence for this assumption of light induction comes
from the fact that interfering R/FR light in the SD night shortens the
time until flowering significantly, and that this effect is
potentiated by the DNA base analog BrDU, but for AU, an inhibitor of
OMPPase and RNase synthesis (Redei, 1975), this effect is not
significant. The data so far obtained with BrDU strongly indicates
that under the SD photoperiod the light quality of the FR may trigger
the synthesis of the putative inhibitor of flowering in Arabidopsis.
There is, additionally, certain variation of this light induction in
the genotypes studied. Thus, this fact suggests that the red/far red
photosensor system optimizes the negative genetic control of flowering
significantly.<p>

Since BrDU is a light sensitizer and may act as a light receptor (esp.
for UV) and/or as wavelength transformer of the absorbed radiation in
the cell, this property makes the DNA base analog most interesting for
further studies of the genetic effects in photoinduced flowering. As
was found previously by Redei et al. (1974) BrDU is obviously
incorporated in the DNA of Arabidopsis through substitution of one
quarter of the thymidine, and then the BrDU containing DNA binds much
tighter some nonhistone type protein, which associated with the
putative suppressor loci impedes the transcription of flowering
inhibitors. For the time being we suppose that the basis of the
interaction between the R/FR-responses and the BrDU effect may be
simply controlled by differential binding of the protein to DNA. This
hypothesis provides a convenient experimental approach for further
analysis of the regulator mechanisms of floral induction in
Arabidopsis.<p>
