LANGRIDGE (1955) isolated first one temperature-sensitive
thiamine-requiring mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana.  Its phenotype is
not distinguishable from that of the wild type at temperature above
27*degrees*C.  At lower temperature (18-23*degrees*C) the mutant
plants fail to grow normally and become characteristically chlorotic.
The majority of our thiamine mutants are obligate auxotrophs that live
only with an exogenous supply of thiamine.  A few can grow to variable
extent without thiamine under certain ranges of temperature and are
said to be temperature -sensitive.<p>

Three types of pyrimidine mutants show different responses to
temperature.  One mutant type (L-2-2) obtained through X-ray induction
on unmarked background is lethal at higher temperature (28*degrees*C),
but at lower temperature (15*degrees*C its growth approaches that of
wild type after a lag period.  Another mutant (L-13-412) produced by
EMS on al (white seed) background shows just the opposite response to
temperature, lethal at lower temperature yet normal at higher
temperature.  The third pyrimidine mutant (L-12-59), EMS induced on gl
(hairless background), is quite similar to the second type described
above. This third is lethal at lower temperature, but sub-vital at
higher temperature.  All of these three types are allelic and belong
to the same locus as several temperature insensitivity
pyrimidine-requiring mutants. These pyrimidine mutants, though
allelic, have opposite responses to temperature indicating that they
represent different genetic sites of the pyrimidine locus.<p>

Table: Temperature-sensitive, thiamine-requiring mutants in
Arabidopsis.  The plants were grown on minimal agar media (2% glucose
and minerals) in aseptic test tubes. The light intensity was about 450
foot candles. The experiment at higher temperature was terminated
after 28 days, at lower temperature after 56 days.  The fresh weight
is the average of around 18 (16-20) plants.<p>

Another thiamine mutant (L-12-107) induced by EMS on gl (hairless)
background) shows similar response to temperature as one of the
pyrimidine mutants. This mutant is semi-lethal at lower temperature
but grows almost like a wild type at higher temperature.  This
thiamine mutant is allelic to LANGRIDGEs thiamine mutant (1018-16).<p>
