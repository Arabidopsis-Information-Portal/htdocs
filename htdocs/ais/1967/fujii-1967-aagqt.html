	Dry F2 seeds obtained from F1 hybrids between a hairless mutant and the wild strain of Arabidopsis were subjected to gamma-rays from [137]Cs source and to [4]He, [12]C and [40]Ar from the Hilac.  From the experiments we could recognize a severe killing effect of heavy ionizing particles, and also dramatically high mutation rates and marked growth inhibition. RBE for somatic mutation at 0.5% frequency was roughly estimated at 10, 35 and 5 for He-, C- and Ar-ions, respectively (FUJII et al., 1966).  The range of heavy ionizing particles is very short. The average seed volume was calculated roughly from the weight and measurements of length and width of the seeds, to be 20.5 x 10E-3 mm3.  From this calculation it was concluded that Arions must be stopped within the seeds but He- and C-ions certainly could penetrate and pass through seed tissue.  Moreover the energy transfer varies according to the position of the range or tissue which may be seen from the Bragg Curve (BRUSTAD et al. 1960).<p>

	A further experiment was undertaken to determine whether the killing efficiency of heavy ionizing particles depends upon the amount of absorption in the seeds.  Dry seeds were irradiated with C-ions in five different lots.  Each lot received the same number of particles per cm-E2, but the energies of the ions were varied for the different lots by a different thickness of absorbers.  Lot 1 received a surface dose of 400 rads.<p>

	Survival rates decreased with the increase of the absorber's thickness.  The results suggest that irradiation with C-ions with the maximum stopping power will show the most severe killing effect. The maximum of stopping power is 6 x 10E-3 Mev/g/gmE-2 at the range of 45 mg/cmE-2.  Namely the RBE value of C-ions should be larger than that obtained in the previous experiment if the embryo were attacked by ions with maximum stopping power.  Further studies are now under way.<p>
