HUSSEIN (1968, 1969) could identify three linkage groups for flowering
time in Arabidopsis thaliana.  One of these is the linkage group
(e3/e4/e7/e8) for genes having large magnitude of effect towards late
flowering.  As the genes (mutations) were in repulsion phase,
selection experiments were carried out to isolate the double and
triple recessives. Selfing experiments are in progress in order to
ensure homozygosity of the recessive selections.<p>

A program of two and three point experiments was designed to study the
inner order and the map distances among the four loci involved in the
above linkage group.<p>
