Abstract:<p>

The diurnal dynamics of phytochrome in the quantitative long day race
Arabidopsis thaliana Estland mutant 2075/4 vernum was studied by
physiological methods at the different day lengths. The data obtained
may be summarized in the following way:<p>

1.  The study of different Pfr levels action at the beginning of 16 h
dark period (DP) and at the beginning of 3 h DP inserted in the middle
of light periods (LP) , shows that the reproduction development
velocity is the higher the lower the Pfr level.<p>

2.  15 minute far-red (FR) treatments at the beginning of DP with the
durations from 2 to 22 h accelerate reproductive processes showing the
Pfr is present during the DP.<p>

3.  15 minute FR treatments at the different time of DP show that the
accelerating FR action is maintained during 12-14 h and consequently
during this time Pfr is present in darkness.<p>

4.  The measurement of Pfr level by zero-method (CUMMING, HENDRICKS,
BORTHWICK, 1967) during the first 8 hours of 16 h DP shows that at
least during this time high Pfr level (approximately equal to the
level reached by pure red light) is maintained. So, from points 2-4 it
follows that hindering action of darkness periods on reproductive
development is determined by the long maintenance of high Pfr levels.<p>

5.  The most rapid transition to reproduction at the continuous light
(CL), and approximately the constant sum of light hours from the
sowing to the bud formation at the lengths of day from 4 h to CL show,
that the induction processes have the considerable velocity only
during the light periods.  Since the Pfr level lowering at the
darkness converts dark hours into inductive ones, one can assume that
the light periods action favourable for development is also determined
by low Pfr levels. This assumption is confirmed by the results of the
experiment, in which 3 groups of plants received in the middle of 16 h
LP a) 3 h of darkness, b) 15 minute FR before 3 h of darkness, c) 3 h
of light. The bud formation was the most rapid in the variant "b",
followed by variant "c" and the most delayed one was the case "a".  As
the developmental velocity is a monotonous decreasing function of Pfr
level (point 1), the results of the experiment show that the light Pfr
level is an intermediate between dark and FR levels and consequently
the light Pfr level is lower than the dark one. The lowering of Pfr
level by light and its increase in the darkness were explained by the
presence of a part of the phytochrome molecules as intermediates
during photoconversion and by their return to final stages in the
darkness. The difference between light and dark levels of Pfr gives a
possibility to plants to reflect the duration of day and night in the
corresponding lengths with low and high Pfr levels, and the
quantitaive dependence of bud formation velocity on Pfr level leads to
automatical shortening of reproductive development time while the day
length increases.<p>
