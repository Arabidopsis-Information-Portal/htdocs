A Postdoctoral Fellow position is available in the lab of Dr. Keith Adams in the Botany 
Department at the University of British Columbia in the area of plant genomics.  My 
lab’s research combines molecular genetics with evolutionary biology and bioinformatics 
approaches to study how gene expression and regulation evolve.  We focus on duplicated 
genes, polyploidy, hybridization, and alternative intron splicing.  See my web page 
at http://www.botany.ubc.ca/people/adams.htm for a description of current research.  I 
am looking for a postdoc to study genomics of alternative splicing patterns in plants. 
Projects will include examining alternative splicing patterns in plant hybrids using RNA-
seq transcriptome profiling, and the postdoc can develop a collaborative project as well 
that is related to the lab’s research topics.  My lab is housed in new research building 
with excellent computational infrastructure.
Candidates should have a strong background in genomics, bioinformatics, or molecular 
evolution in any organism.  Experience with computational analysis of sequence or 
expression data is required as is the ability to do scripting in Perl or Python.  Experience 
with next generation sequence analysis (Solexa, 454, or SOLiD) is desirable but not 
required. The start date can be any time between late July 2009 and early January 
2010.  Funding is available for at least two years.
 
For more information contact Keith Adams at keitha@interchange.ubc.ca  Informal 
inquiries about the research area and projects are welcome.  To apply, send a CV, a 
description of your research interests and your Ph.D. research, and contact information 
for three references to the above email address.
