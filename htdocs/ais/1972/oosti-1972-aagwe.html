Last year the isolation of a chlorate resistant mutant with a low
nitrate-reductase content was reported (VAN DER LAAN,
OOSTINDIER-BRAAKSMA, and FEENSTRA, 1971).  This mutant had a
yellow-green colour and a habitus somewhat different from wildtype.
Based on the segregation of this phenotype it was stated that the
chlorate resistance was recessive and monogenic (gene chl-2).<p>

Further experiments showed, however, that the situation is more
complex.  From F3 families two different resistant types could be
extracted:<p>

a.  A line with normal plant habitus and only slightly lighter green
leaf colour, at least when the plants are over 9 days old, but with a
low nitrate reductase activity in extracts of rosette leaves, and
chlorate resistant.  Plants grow very badly on nitrate as the only
nitrogen source.<p>

b.  A line with plant colour and habitus similar to that of the
originally isolated mutant, with moderate chlorate-resistance, but
with a normal nitrate-reductase activity in extracts of
rosette-leaves.<p>

We want to reserve the symbol chl-2 for the gene giving the phenotype
described under a. and denominated the gene giving b. phenotype chl-8.<p>

We do not know as yet what the reason is for the simultaneous
isolation of the genes chl-2 and chl-8.  The results of crosses do not
suggest a close linkage between the genes.  Further experiments have
revealed that the frequencies with which mutants of the above types
can be isolated are low.<p>

Experiments showed that the chlorate resistance of the ch-2 type is
not due to a lower uptake of chlorate, as is the case with our chl-1
and chl-3 mutants.  A smaller amount of the chlorate is reduced by the
plants. This is further support for the hypothesis that nitrate
reductase is involved in the reduction of chlorate.<p>

The nitrate content of chl-2 type plants appeared to be higher than
that of the wildtype so that the lower level of nitrate reductase is
not caused by the absence of nitrate necessary for induction.<p>
