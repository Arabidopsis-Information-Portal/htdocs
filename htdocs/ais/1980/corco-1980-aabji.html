Photoperiod studies with Arabidopsis have shown that this plant
flowers most rapidly in continuous light and that in short days
flowering occurs, but is considerably retarded. In these studies
(Redei, 1974; Gregory and Hussey, 1953) the photoperiods ranged from
8-9 hours to 24 hours.<p>

We wanted to know whether photoperiods shorter than 8 hours or even 4
hours (some ecotypes can develop flower primordia in 4-5 hour light
periods, Laibach, 1951) prevent budding in Arabidopsis thaliana. We
compared the effects of two hour versus 24 hour illumination
(incandescent light) on the development of the Columbia variety.<p>

Under constant illumination and on a mineral plus 2% sugar medium, the
plants budded in 20 days and seeded in 33 days. However, plants under
two-hour illumination, on the same medium, stopped growth completely
after they attained rosette stage (4 to 5 small leaves). They remained
green for two months. After which time, we changed the duration of the
illumination to three hours to see whether these plants resume growth,
they do.<p>

This first set of plants germinated under constant light and were
transferred soon after germination under two hours of illumination. In
a second experiment, the plants germinated under two hours of
illumination, but stopped growth soon after. The leaves have very
little chlorophyll, just enough for the plants not to die, but not
enough for them to grow.<p>
