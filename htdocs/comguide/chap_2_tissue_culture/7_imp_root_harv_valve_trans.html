*  What follows is a detailed protocol which I follow when transforming 
Arabidopsis.  It differs from the Valvekens (Valvekens, D., Van Montagu, 
M. & Van Lijsebettens, M. 1988.  Agrobacterium tumefaciens- mediated 
transformation of Arabidopsis thaliana root explants by using kanamycin 
selection. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 5536-5540)  protocol only in a 
few details, most of which were adopted for convenience rather than for 
an improvement in efficiency.  The one change that I do feel improves 
efficiency is the omission of MES from all media.  Other items to note.  
Not all commercial MS salts contain the same components.  Gibco MS 
salts differ from Hazelton, for example, and may not work quite as well 
(I've not done a controlled experiment on that one).  The choice of 
agar/agarose used in your plates can make a dramatic difference, 
especially when choosing an appropriate antibiotic concentration for 
selection.  In a controlled experiment using seedlings from bona-fide 
transformants, I found that the seedlings were 10 times more sensitive 
to kanamycin on BRL agarose compared to N.C. Biologicals T.C. agar.  
Many of you have asked about ecotype differences.  I have had the best 
luck with ecotype No-0, but also had very good results with Col-0 La-er, 
and Po-1.  Ws-0 did not work well for me, but still gave me a few verified 
transformants.  I have not tried any other ecotypes.

1.  MEDIA
  (i) GERMINATION MEDIUM (GM)
0.5 x Murashige & Skoog salt mixture (Hazelton Biologics)
1 % sucrose
pH 5.7, adjusted with 1 N KOH before autoclaving
0.8% tissue culture grade agar (e.g., Carolina Biologicals T.C. agar; 0.5% 
BRL agarose also works very well)
1 mll-1 1000x Gamborg's B-5 vitamins (added after autoclaving)

1000x B-5 vitamins 10 mll-1
myo-inositol 1 g 
Thiamine HCl 0.1 g 
Nicotinic acid 10 mg
Pyridoxine HCl 10 mg

  (ii) 0.5/0.05 CALLUS-INDUCING MEDIUM (CIM)
1 x Gamborg's B5 medium with sucrose (Gibco)
pH 5.5, adjusted with 1N KOH before autoclaving
0.8% agar (for solid media)
0.5 mgl-1 2,4-D 
0.05 mgl-1 kinetin

  (iii) 0.5/0.05 WITH CARBENICILLIN
As 0.5/0.05, but supplemented with
500 mgl-1 carbenicillin
  (iv) 0.15/5.0 SHOOT INDUCING MEDIUM (SIM)
1 x Gamborg's B5 medium with sucrose (Gibco)pH 5.5, adjusted with 1N 
KOH before autoclaving
0.8% agar
5.0 mgl-1 N6-(2-isopentenyl)adenine (2ip)
0.15 mgl-1 indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)

  (v) 0.15/5.0 WITH HYGROMYCIN OR KANAMYCIN
As 0.15/5, but supplemented with
500 mgl-1 carbenicillin
20 mgl-1 hygromycin or 50 mgl-1 kanamycin

  (vi) SHOOT ELONGATION MEDIUM (EM)
1 x Murashige & Skoog salt mixture (Hazelton Biologics)
10 gl-1 sucrose
pH 5.8, adjusted with 1 N KOH
0.5% agarose (seed set seems to be better on agarose)
1 mgl-1 Indole Butyric Acid (IBA), made fresh every time
1 ml 1000x Gamborg's B-5 vitamins
500 mgl-1 carbenicillin

 *  All media should be poured into plates in the rear half of a laminar flow 
hood and allowed to  dry completely before putting on the lids (30 min in 
Berkeley, longer in Indiana).  This step  helps prevent bacterial 
overgrowth and encourages seed set.

 *  All hormones, antibiotics, and vitamins are added after autoclaving.  
Sigma now sells "Plant  Cell Culture Grade" reagents (sucrose, vitamins, 
hormones, etc.), which are worth trying if  problems regenerating plants 
without selection are encountered.  For convenience, media are  made 
up ahead of time as a 2 x stock without agar, antibiotics, or hormones, 
typically 200 ml in  500 ml bottles.  An equal volume of sterile 2 x water 
agar (1.6%) is melted in a microwave and  added to the bottle containing 
the 2 x medium and then hormones, etc. are added.   Hormones and 
antibiotics are made up as 1000 x stocks in DMSO and distilled water,  
respectively, and filter sterilised.  These can be stored at -20oC for 
several weeks, except for  IBA, which should be made up freshly.  GM is 
poured into Falcon 1013 plates (150 x 25 mm).   SIM and CIM are poured 
into Labtek 4026 plates (100 x 25 mm) and EM is poured into Magenta  
GA7 boxes.  Plates are sealed with a gas permeable tape (e.g., 3M Filter 
Tape, Carolina  Biologicals Cat. No. 19-9708, or 3M Transpore Surgical 
Tape available in most drug stores).

2.  SEED STERILISATION
  (i) Submerge seed in 70% ethanol for 5 min
  (ii) Rinse seed 2 x in sterile distilled water
  (iii) Submerge seed in 2.6% sodium hypochlorite (0.5 x standard 
laundry bleach)/0.05% Tween for 10 min, agitating regularly
  (iv) Rinse seed 4 x in sterile distilled water  (v) After last wash, keep 
seeds in ~0.5 ml water; using a sterile glass pasteur pipette, take up 
seed and spread onto GM plates, about 100 per plate
  (iv) Place seeded GM plates at 4oC for 48 h to break dormancy.

 *  I suggest trying Luca Comai's trick of lining the seeds up along the top 
third of the plate and  then placing the plate vertically in the growth 
chamber.

3.   Growth of seedlings
  (i) Incubate cold-treated seeds on GM in a clean controlled environment 
(24oC; 15 h light/9 h dark; 70-100 uEm-2s-1 light intensity).  Seeds 
should germinate within 3 d.  Roots are usable for transformation after 20 
d and are good until about 35 d.

4.  Transformation of root explants
 *  All manipulations are done in a sterile hood.

  (i) Pull plantlets (20-35 day old plants) gently out of the GM using a 
forceps.
  (ii) Put plantlet in a sterile empty petri dish.  Cut off root system from
rest of plant so that no green parts remain attached to the root.  Immediately
place intact root system on CIM (no antibiotics).  Spread flat so that all
rootlets are in contact with plate.  Place several root systems on a single CIM
plate. 
  (iii) Incubate in growth chamber (same settings as for growth of plants 
above) for 3 d.
  (iv) After the 3 d "pretreatment", remove intact root systems from CIM 
plates and place in 50 ml Corning sterile polypropylene tube containing 
10 ml of liquid CIM.
  (v) Add 0.5 ml of 24-48 h Agrobacterium culture and vortex gently.  The 
Agrobacterium is grown in L-broth supplemented with appropriate 
antibiotics (50 mgl-1 kanamycin, 25 mgl-1 chloramphenicol, 50 mgl-
1spectinomycin, and 30 mgl-1 streptomycin for strain ASE with a pMON 
based vector).  The culture should be saturated at the time of adding to 
the roots.
  (vi) Let sit for about 2 min to let roots settle, then decant liquid.  Remove 
clump of roots with forceps and place in a sterile petri dish containing 
several Whatman filter papers to blot up excess liquid.
  (vii) Transfer intact roots to CIM plates.
  (viii) Cut root systems into 0.5 cm segments using sterile scissors and 
spread out "clumps" of root pieces, but keep root pieces within a clump 
together.  *  One root explant consists of several 0.5 cm root segments 
and can be considered as a  cutting of about 0.5 cm through an entire 
root system.

  (ix) Incubate infected root explants for 48 h, by which time explants 
should be overgrown by a thin Agrobacterium slime.
  (x) Wash off Agrobacterium by transferring explants to Corning 50 ml 
tube containing 25 ml 1 x B5 medium (no hormones) supplemented with 
500 mgl-1 carbenicillin.  Vortex gently and let root pieces settle.  Decant 
liquid slowly into the lid of a sterile petri dish keeping as many of the root 
pieces in the tube as possible.  When only a couple of ml of liquid 
remains in the tube, dump liquid and roots onto Whatman  filter disks 
placed in the bottom of the petri dish to absorb the rest of the liquid.  
Use forceps to transfer any escaped root pieces in the lid to the filters in 
the dish.  Blot the top of the root pieces with another Whatman filter disk.
  (xi) Transfer root pieces to SIM plates containing carbenicillin (500 mgl-
1) and the appropriate selective antibiotic (typically 50 mgl-1 kanamycin 
sulfate (Sigma) or 20 mgl-1 Hygromycin B (Boehringer)).  Reassemble 
root explants by clumping together root pieces.
  (xii) Incubate in growth chamber for 2-3 weeks.  Tiny green calli covered 
with root hairs should start appearing in about 6 d.  On kanamycin the 
rest of the root explant remains white.  On hygromycin the explant turns 
yellow then brown.  The green calli should continue to enlarge.  
Development of shoots can be expedited by transferring to fresh media 
every 7 d.
  (xiii) During the third week, cut the green calli away from the dead 
explant material and transfer to a fresh SIM plate containing the same 
antibiotics.  Shoots should soon start appearing.  Onset of shooting is 
highly dependent on the Arabidopsis ecotype used.  We use No-0, 
which shoots very rapidly.  Columbia is slower to shoot, but will shoot if 
explants are transferred to fresh medium every 7 d.  Landsberg (La-0) 
and Po-1 shoot well.
  (xiv) After shoots form a small rosette, transfer whole callus and rosette 
to a Magenta jar containing EM (note that carbenicillin is present in EM, 
but the other antibiotics are omitted at this point).  Keep lid on tight 
initially.  The plant should bolt within 2-3 weeks,  at which time the 
explants should be transferred to a fresh EM Majenta jar (one plant per 
jar) that has a ~1 inch hole cut in the lid (a #14 cork borer works nicely for 
this modification).  The hole is plugged with a foam stopper.  This allows 
the humidity to drop to a level that allows seed to set, while still 
maintaining sterility.  Plants must be transferred to fresh jars every 7 d  as 
the agarose will dry out.  Plenty of seed should set in these assemblies, 
but once roots form (not all explants will form roots) they can be 
transferred to soil.  Seed production is better in plants growing in soil, 
but I do not usually do this as seeds can be bulked up in the next 
generation.
  (xv) To put plants in soil, transfer them to 2 inch pots in Majenta jars that 
have been autoclaved with soil in pot and saturated with water 
containing a fertiliser (e.g., 0.5 x MS salts or 0.25 x Rapid-Gro Plant Food 
23-19-17).  After putting plants in the soil, put lid on tightly for 3 d, then 
slowly crack open to allow gradual drying.  After 5 d the lid can be 
completely removed.  Do not keep soil soggy as this encourages rotting.  
Just keep slightly damp.

5.  COMMENTS
 *  If carbenicillin cannot be used to counterselect the Agrobacterium 
strain used, vancomycin  may be substituted.  However, vancomycin is 
not as effective and care must be taken to wash  roots thoroughly after 
the infection (i.e., do two or three successive washes in SIM containing  
1000 mgl-1 vancomycin and blot well before placing back on plates 
containing 750 mgl-1  vancomycin).  In addition, explants should be 
transferred to fresh plates every 7 d at a  minimum.

 *  I have heard that other people have had difficulty with the hygromycin 
selection using this  protocol, but I have not.  I suspect that it is the 
promoter driving Hyg that makes the difference.   I use a 35S Hyg gene 
from the vector pMON408.
