University of GeorgiaPostdoctoral Research Associate Position, Department of HorticultureA postdoctoral researcher position is available immediately in the Department of Horticulture, University of Georgia, Tifton Campus (http://www.caes.uga.edu/campus/tifton/) to characterize the function of a BABY BOOM-LIKE gene linked to the apomixis locus (ASGR) in Pennisetum as part of our broader apomixis research program (http://nespal.org/oziasakinslab/projects/ apomixis-gene-discovery/).  Apomixis is a naturally occurring mode of asexual reproduction in flowering plants that results in seed formation without the involvement of meiosis or fertilization of the egg.  Expression and function of the ASGR-BBML gene will be assessed through the analysis of transgenic Pennisetum plants engineered for promoter characterization and regulation of expression.  Although transgenic lines already are available for analysis, previous experience with monocot tissue culture and transformation is desirable.  Analysis of reproductive tissues will involve a variety of microscopy methods in addition to molecular methods for determination of transgene copy number and expression levels.  A successful candidate must be able to work in a team-oriented environment, and be a motivated critical thinker who has demonstrated excellent oral and written communication skills. This position includes fringe benefits.  The University of Georgia is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer.Application Instructions: Applicants should email a brief statement of research interests and career goals, CV with information on academic/work experience, awards, publications, and names and contact information for 3 references to Peggy Ozias-Akins [pozias@uga.edu]. Applications will be reviewed as they are received.
