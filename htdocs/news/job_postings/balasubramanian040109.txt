Good weather! Great beaches! Friendly people! OZ living! Along the sidelines some 
cool science! Would you be interested? PhD positions are available in the laboratory 
of Dr. Sureshkumar Balasubramanian (SKB Lab – Where Science is fun!; 
http://www.uq.edu.au/~uqmsures) at the University of Queensland, Brisbane, 
Australia to work on projects exploring natural variation in  Arabidopsis thaliana. We 
seek to encourage highly motivated individuals who wish to pursue a career in 
science. The candidate will use genetic and molecular techniques to identify and 
characterise genes underlying phenotypic variation. SKB lab, which is a part of the 
Ecological and Evolutionary Functional Genomics initiative of the University of 
Queensland also offers several other novel options in a stimulative environment that 
cuts across traditional boundaries and barriers (Sureshkumar et al, Science, 2009;  
Balasubramanian et al, Nature Genetics, 2006; Balasubramanian et al, PLoS 
Genetics, 2006). Interested candidates please contact SKB lab at
