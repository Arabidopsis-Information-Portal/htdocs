Plant Genome Research Summer Internship 2007

The Plant Genome Research Program (PGRP) at Cornell University and Boyce 
Thompson Institute is sponsoring summer internships in Ithaca, New York. 
Internships are 8-10 weeks in length in a participating lab currently doing 
plant genome research. Interns will be mentored by a graduate student or post-
doctoral associate and will work with their mentors on a project related to 
plant genomics. They will learn the latest in molecular biology techniques, and 
depending on the lab, may also participate in fieldwork. All students will be 
attending lab meetings, reading and discussing recent literature related to 
their project, and will present their research to the other students, principal 
investigators, and mentors at our summer student symposium. For participation in 
the program, student interns will be provided a stipend, housing, and some 
travel expenses.
Please contact the Outreach coordinator, Elizabeth Fox, Ph.D. (pgrp-
outreach@cornell.edu) for more information. Application materials are available 
on the website (http://bti.cornell.edu/pgrp/).
