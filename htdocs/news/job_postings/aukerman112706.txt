DuPont Crop Genetics, Wilmington, DE, USA

The Genetic Discovery Group of DuPont Crop Genetics is looking for a highly 
motivated individual with strong backgrounds in plant genetics and molecular 
biology. The successful candidate will utilize genetic and molecular approaches 
to investigate regulatory circuits mediated by miRNAs.  The end-product of this 
research should be the identification of sequence and/or stoichiometric 
requirements for miRNA function, using Arabidopsis as a model system.  Forward 
genetic screens will also be employed, in order to identify novel components of 
miRNA-mediated silencing.
A PhD is required, with a strong background in plant molecular biology. Must 
have extensive experience with the following techniques: DNA/RNA isolation, blot 
hybridization, cloning techniques, PCR amplification, small RNA 
isolation/detection, and protein detection using immunoblotting. In addition, 
experience with Arabidopsis growth/phenotyping and genetic mapping techniques is 
highly desirable.
Qualified candidates should apply by logging on to the DuPont/Pioneer job 
website at http://www.pioneer.com/employment/openings/search.asp, and searching 
for job number 4349BR.
