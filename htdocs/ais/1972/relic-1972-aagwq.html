<h2> The distribution of induced mutations in the shoot apex of Arabidopsis seeds</h2><p>

When mutations are induced in the shoot apices of seeds, the
probability of simultaneous occurrence of two or more independent
mutations in the same nucleus tends to increase with increasing the
total frequency of induced mutations.  The significance of this fact
in the mutation breeding was demonstrated by HANSEL (1967) in barley.
CETL (1969) and RIESOVA-KUCEROVA (1969) studied the role of double
mutations in the modification of the type of dependence between the
concentration of methyl-nitrosourea and the frequency of different
types of mutations in Arabidopsis.  In all spermatophyta, the
situation is complicated by the complex organization of the vegetative
shoot apex (cf. ESAU, 1960; POPHAM, 1963) so that LANGRIDGE (1958) was
able to estimate, on the basis of mutation experiments with X-rays in
Arabidopsis, that the mean number of apical initials per apex is two.<p>

In the present experiments, current doses and/or concentrations of
X-rays, ethyl-methanesulfonate (EMS) and methyl-nitrosourea (MNU)
applied to dry seeds of Arabidopsis were used to induce lethal and
vital chlorophyll and morphological mutations.  In the M2, individual
M1 families were studied separately.  If more than one mutation
appeared in the same M1 family under such an arrangement of
experiments, it could be due to two alternatives: (1) a double or a
multiple mutation was induced in the nucleus of one apical initial,
(2) two or more mutations originated in different apical initials.
Both named cases could be, of course, combined in some families. By
analyzing corresponding M3's (HANSEL, 1967) it can be distinguished
between these two possibilities.  An exact analysis requires, however
to take the complex organization of the shoot apex into consideration.<p>

Our results (Table 1) showed that only one mutation appeared in each
segregating M1 family after X-irradiation.  After EMS and MNU, on the
contrary, also M1 families segregating for two or more mutations were
observed in the same proportion as those with only one mutation.<p>

Table 1: Results of the analysis of M1 families after different
mutagenic treatment of dry seeds of Arabidopsis<p>

Segregation ratios 3:1, 7:1, 11:1, 15:1, etc were taken into
consideration for estimating the number of one, two, three, four, etc.
apical initials carrying a mutation in families with one mutation
(LANGRIDGE, 1958).  On this basis, a highly significant agreement with
the 7:1 ratio (P = 70 to 95 percent) was found in all mutagenes used.
This result suggested that two apical initials, on the average were
involved in such families.<p>

The given estimation of the mean number of apical initials in the
shoot apex was used in further considerations: if two independent
mutations are arising in one i.e., either both mutations in one
initial while the other initial was without any mutation ("[2/0]") or each
mutation was located in another initial ("[1/1]") (see RELICHOVA and CETL,
1972).  Then a hypothesis might be suggested that these two cases were
equally possible, P [2/0] = P [1/0]  According to this hypothesis, half of M1
families segregating for more than one mutation would segregate in
18/32 non-mutants, 6/32 both "simple" mutants and in 1/32 double
mutants.  The other half of these families would segregate in 3/4
non-mutants and in 1/4 of both "simple" mutants.<p>

This hypothesis was tested and the expected percent of different
mutants was very near to the observed ones (in EMS: expected 7.38
percent, observed 7.63 percent; in MNU: expected 10.31 percent,
observed 11.30 percent).  At the same time, the percentage of double
mutations according to CETL (1969) was compared with the estimation fo
the frequency of double mutations in agreement without hypothesis.
This time, the former values were two or four times higher than the
latter ones (in EMS: 0.63 percent vs. 0.30 percent; in MNU: 1.69
percent vs. 0.44 percent).<p>

Various causes of this discrepancy can be given but linkage between
the two mutant alleles seems to be the most important: in M1 apical
initials, the mutant alleles are present in coupling so that the
double mutant recessive homozygotes are the more frequent the more
closely they are linked.<p>

The experiments are continued by analysing the M2 subfamilies in the
M3.  The results yet obtained showed, that some M1 plants segregating
for two mutations carried really both mutations in the same initial
("[2/0/...]") while in the others, the two mutations were induced in two
different inititals ("[1/1/...]").<p>
