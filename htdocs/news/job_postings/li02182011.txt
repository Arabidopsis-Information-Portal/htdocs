Postdoctoral Research Associate in protein biochemistry

The Wurtele Laboratory at Iowa State University is seeking candidate to 
fill a Postdoctoral Research Associate position in Protein Biochemistry and 
Biological Networks, to begin immediately or summer 2011. 
Protein Biochemistry and Biological Networks The successful candidate 
will join a team of scientists working to uncover novel signaling 
interactions in plant metabolic networks, in a 4-year project recently 
funded by the National Science Foundation (MCB#0951170, 
http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0951170). The 
successful applicant will focus on identification of proteins that interact 
with known or candidate proteins of the starch regulatory network, 
functional characterization of candidate genes, and elucidation of 
protein-protein interactions. Possible biochemical approaches include, but 
are not limited to, protein expression and purification, protein structure 
determination, yeast-two-hybrid screening, co-immunoprecipitation and 
tandem affinity purification. A PhD in biochemistry, biology, chemistry or 
a related field is required. Publication record should demonstrate 
expertise in protein functional and structural characterization. Signal 
transduction and/or bioinformatics expertise is a plus. 

The candidate will be part of a multidisciplinary team that includes 
computer scientists, computational biologists, molecular biologists 
and biochemists. The successful candidate is expected to demonstrate 
independence and creativity. Good oral and written skills and a strong 
publication record in refereed journals are required. We seek highly 
motivated researcher with demonstrated outstanding ability and 
accomplishment. The position is located in state-of-the-art facilities 
at Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa and offers competitive salary 
and benefits with the opportunity for professional growth and 
advancement. 

Applications should include a cover letter highlighting qualifications 
and research interests, current CV, publication list. Have three 
letters/emails of reference sent from persons familiar with your 
professional qualifications, include your dissertation advisor as one 
of the three. For more information regarding application submission or 
project details, please contact Dr. Ling Li at liling@iastate.edu.
