Funding is available for a graduate research assistant (M.S. or Ph.D.) to study functional 
or evolutionary genomics of climate-related stress tolerance in forest trees at Virginia 
Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg, Virginia. The successful 
candidate will have a B.S. or equivalent in an applicable field (e.g., Biology, Forestry, 
Molecular Biology) and will join a collaborative group in the Molecular Plant Sciences 
program with strengths in molecular biology, genomics and proteomics. The specific 
research project will be open to discussion, but may include functional characterization of 
conifer gene families involved in seasonal cold hardiness, genome-scale searches for the 
genetic targets of natural selection related to climate, or genotype-phenotype association 
studies. Assistantship includes tuition, health coverage, and a stipend of $18,732/year at 
the master's level or $19,860 at the Ph.D. level. Please contact Jason A. Holliday for 
further details (jah1@interchange.ubc.ca).
