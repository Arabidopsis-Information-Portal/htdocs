Until recently the gene map of Arabidopsis thaliana was rather
fragmentary (Kranz and Scheidemann, 1978). By applying trisomic
analysis the correct relation between chromosome/chromosome arm and
linkage groups could be established (Lee-Chen and Steinitz-Sears,
1967; Sears and Lee-Chen, 1970; Koornneef and Van der Veen, 1983).<p>

In addition, the mapping of 76 different loci on the 5 chromosomes
made Arabidopsis thaliana one of the few plant species with a well
established gene map (Koornneef et al., 1983). It seems useful to use
this rather accurate and internally consistent map as a starting point
and framework for future genemapping experiments.<p>

In order to do this a number of well-defined markers should be
available with well-established linkage positions distributed over all
chromosomes. This short communication lists a number of lines
homozygous recessive for at least 2 markers at the same chromosome or
for markers at different chromosomes (Table 1). These lines and a
number of trisomics and telotrisomics are available on request from
the author's address.<p>

listed in Table 1. Circles with range indicate position of the
centromere.<p>

This small collection will also be sent to the AIS seed bank at
Frankfurt and can there be obtained from A.R. Kranz. These markers can
be easily recognized by their mutant phenotype. However, cp-2 and f ca
may give some difficulties especially when a population segregates for
other plant length and flowering time genes. All lines are in the
background of the "erecta" mutant of the ecotype Landsberg unless
stated otherwise.<p>

For a detailed description of the markers and their linkage relations
the reader is referred to Koornneef et al., 1983. The map positions of
the markers of Table 1 are summarized in Figure 1. The trisomics are
described in detail and compared with other trisomics by Koornneef and
Van der Veen, 1983.<p>
