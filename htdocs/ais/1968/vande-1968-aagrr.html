<h2>Complementing alleles as a cause of apparent reversion of pyrimidineless mutants</h2><p>

The studies on reversion of pyrimidineless mutants in Arabidopsis were
continued (see the previous report: Van Den BERG et al., 1967), and
the hypothesis was tested that growth of a revertant is due to
interallelic complementation between the original mutant allele (py)
and an allele that has undergone a further mutation (py c).  In this
conception the latter allele when present homozygously would lead to a
deficient phenotype. The roughly 50% deficient plants found in M3- and
further generations of selfed revertants then should for equal parts
be composed of py py and py c py c.  When crossed to the original
mutant (py py) the former should give a deficient, and the latter a
(semi-) wild progeny. Crossing of non-deficient plants from the
aforementioned segegating generations by the original mutant line
should result in progenies, segregating deficient to nondeficient in a
one to one ratio.<p>

Five revertant lines were tested in this way, the results are given in
the following table.  In order to select the deficient plants from
segregating families, seeds were sown on a mineral medium. After the
phenotype of the parents had been established growth of deficient
plants was restored by supplementation of the medium with thiamine.
This supplementation had to be carried out at an early moment in order
to obtain well growing plants required for crossing purposes. Because
of this a rather large number of plants had not reached the
developmental stage necessary for distinction between deficient and
non-deficient, and hence could not be scored.<p>

The data show that two types do occur among the deficient plants,
although there are rather large deviations from the 1:1 ratio.
However, differences in recovery from the starvation period between
the genotypes may account for this.  Some of the segregating progenies
show an excess of deficient plants, which is difficult to explain at
this moment.  Because of their nature we would like to call the
alleles arisen by a second mutation "complementing alleles", and refer
to the homozygous deficient types as "complementants".<p>

These data then may be taken as to support our hypothesis outlined
above, although they do not exclude an alternative hypothesis of an
external suppressor, acting only in heterozygous condition.  However,
results of crosses of complementants to pyrimidineless mutants other
than the parent line do not support the latter possibility. As has
been reported previously (FEENSTRA, 1964), mutant alleles of classes
py-1 and py-2 show between-group complementation.  E.G., V 462 and V
43, when crossed give a semi-wild F1.  Thus, if growth of revertants
were due to the action of an external suppressor, one would expect
that the complementant from &#215; 462, in which then the unchanged py-1
allele would be present, would complement with V 43 which is ph-2,
and, in an analogous way, the complementant from &#215; 43 would
complement with &#215; 462.  Both F's were made, but turned out to be
deficient. &#157;his is indicative of changes in the ph-1, resp.  py-2
alleles themselves, or at least of changes in the py-region, if py-1
and py-2 would turn out to be two different closely linked cistrons.<p>

In our hypothesis, growth of revertants and comparable types must be
considered as an extreme case of heterozygote superiority, or
monogenic heterosis.  Compared with the parent allele, a complementing
allele would differ from it in one site only, assuming that we are
dealing with point mutations.<p>

In microorganisms interallelic complementation is a common phenomenon,
but is thought to involve alleles differing in two sites.  The
occurrence of complementation between alleles differing in one site is
not excluded, but must be much more difficult to find, since
complementation tests are necessary.  In a diploid organism like
Arabidopsis a complementing allele is selected for in the presence of
its parent allele, and will show up immediately after mutagenic
treatment.  The work is being continued.<p>
