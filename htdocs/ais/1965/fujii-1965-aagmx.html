RBE values of 1,5 MeV fission and 14,1 MeV fast neutrons to gamma-
rays in Arabidopsis were studied by specific loci method.  The flower
of this plant is small and it is somewhat difficult to obtain many F1
seeds.  Therefore, F2 seeds from the cross between a single recessive
hairless and a wild strain (Landsberg) were used.<p>

Table 1: Segregation ratio and mutation rate in irradiated F2
populations<p>

Dry seeds were subjected to 1,5 2,5 and 3,5 krad of 1,5 MeV fission
neutrons in Oak Ridge National Laboratory and also to 0,9,2,0,2,9 and
4,9 krad of monoenergetic 14,1 MeV fast neutrons in Hiroshima
University.  20 to 50 kr of gamma-irradiations from 60C*degrees* and
137Cs were also carried out in each neutron experiment in Oak Ridge
National Laboratory and National Institute of Genetics, respectively.
About l.000 seeds in each lot were sown in sterilized sand and
experiments were carried out under continuous artificial light in an
air-conditioned room at 25 +4*degrees*C.  Around 90 percent of seeds
germinated in the controls and all irradiated lots, and almost all of
seedlings survived.  Irradiations up to 50 kr of gamma-rays and 5 krad
of neutrons had no effect on germination or survival rate.<p>

During the growth of seedlings, segregation ratio of hairless
homozygotes was examined.  Hairless homozygotes segregated according
to the ratio of 3 : 1 in all lots, as expected, and segregation
fitted, according to chi-square test, the simple Mendelian ratio.
Therefore, haired plants must have consisted of homo- and
heterozygotes, namely two thirds could be assumed to be heterozygotes.
Should somatic mutation from dominant haired to recessive hairless
occur in heterozygotic seeds, it had to appear as hairless sectors for
which they were examined.  Number of such plants with such sectors
were counted.  Mutation rates increased with increasing dosage in each
kind of radiation and the relation was non-linear.  Mutation rates
were almost the same at 25 kr of 60D*degrees* gamma-rays and 1,5 krad
of 1,5 MeV fission neutron and 0,80 percent were obtained in both
lots.  From the results, RBE value of 1,5 MeV fission neutron to
gamma-rays was about 16.  On the other hand, mutation rate in the
lowest dosage lot of 14,1 MeV fast neutrons was somewhat high when it
is compared with the other lots.  But, RBE value of 14,1 MeV fast
neutrons may be estimated as about 13 from the curve of mutation rates
and dosages.<p>
