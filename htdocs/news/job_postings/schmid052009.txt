A post-doctoral position is available immediately at the Max Planck Institute for 
Developmental Biology, Germany, to study the integration of flowering time signals 
in Arabidopsis thaliana. The successful candidate will employ high-throughput 
technologies such as massively parallel sequencing and/ or microarrays to investigate 
the transcriptional network regulating flowering at the shoot apical meristem 
inArabidopsis thaliana with a focus on MADS box transcription factors.
Applicants should hold a PhD in plant biology, genetics or a related field. A strong 
background in molecular techniques is expected. Experience in high-throughput 
technologies, in particular next-generation sequencing and/or microarray technologies, 
would be helpful but is not a strict requirement.
We seek motivated and ambitious collaborators and provide a well-equipped, interactive 
environment. Salary will be according to TVöD, E13. Funding is available for up to three 
(3) years as part of the ERA-PG / DFG-funded ‘BLOOMNET’ consortium. The working
