AIS Vol 02:<h2>Production of thiamineless mutants</h2><p>

Netherlands)<p>

Since our last report on this subject (FEENSTRA 1964) 45 more mutants
in which the thiamine synthesis is blocked were found, 19 requiring at
least the pyrimidine moiety of the vitamin molecule for growth, 12 the
thiazole part and 14 the complete vitamin.  Up to now in total 69
independently arisen mutants have been obtained.  Based on the results
of crossings the presence of 10 groups of mutually allelic mutant
genes could be shown, 59 of the mutants could be assigned so far to a
group.  Four groups of thiamine requiring mutants were found, with 2,
3, 8 and 1 mutants falling in them, none of them being allelic with
the early thiamineless mutant of LANGRIDGE (1958).  Growth
requirements of the first group are also fulfilled by a mixture of
pyrimidine and thiazole.<p>

The distribution of pyrimidineless mutants in three groups, as
mentioned by FEENSTRA (1964) was confirmed, 13 of the mutants belong
to group I, and show allelism with the mutant py of REDEI (1960), 4
mutants belong to group II; the latter, when crossed by a
representative of group I, give a (usually semi-) wild type F1.  Group
III contains 13 mutants which give mutant type F1's both when crossed
to group I and group II.  For the mutant genes in group I, II and III
the symbols py-1, py-2 and py-d are suggested (cf. this volume, page
25).<p>

Comparable distribution was found for the thiazoleless mutants: one
group of 4 mutants which are allelic with REDEI's mutant tz for which
now the denotation tz-1 is suggested-, a second series of 8 (tz-2) and
a third of 3 mutants (tz-d), with complementation pattern analogues to
that found among the three pyrimidine groups.<p>
