<p>
    Applications are invited for a postdoctoral position to study the functional
    relevance and regulation of alternative splicing in the Plant Molecular
    Biology group at the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ci&#xEA;ncia (IGC) near Lisbon,
    Portugal (<a href="http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt">http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt</a>).
    The position will be initially available for one year, with renewal based on
    performance and funding availability.
</p>
<p>Research in the lab uses Arabidopsis thaliana as a model system and a
    combination of genetic, molecular/cell biology, biochemical and genomic
    approaches to investigate how plants respond to environmental cues. Our
    major line of work is addressing the biological significance of alternative
    splicing and providing functional evidence linking this key
    posttranscriptional regulation mechanism to plant abiotic stress responses.
    Another ongoing project in the lab is uncovering physiological roles for
    membrane transporters of the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) in plant
    responses to different environmental challenges.</p>
