Photosynthesis is a complex process consisting of a series of
photochemical as well as dark intermediate stages. As the metabolism
of plants has numerable possibilities for regulation of its separate
links, therefore it is very interesting to study the
physio-biochemical processes in vivo. However, to understand the
mechanism of biochemical processes it is necessary to study even the
simple system which consists of separate or partial components of the
photosynthetic apparatus going with each other (Evstigneev, 1975). The
suspension of isolated chloroplasts possessing the possibility of
occurrence of the very first reaction of photosynthesis forms a apart
of it. However, isolated chloroplasts of certain plants do not show
their photosynthetical activity under lack of standard condition
especially for such classical objects as spinach or peas. Arabidopsis
thaliana also belongs to this group. The difficulty in extraction of
active chloroplasts from leaves of Arabidopsis comes from the vacuoles
of its cells containing sap of low pH, ranging from 4 to 5. With this
breakage of the cell the sap gets free and acidifies the media and in
this way inactivates the enzymes. Besides the disadvantages of
Arabidopsis as subject of research the very small size of its plant
during early stages of growth hinders its investigation at present
time.<p>

Rendering an account of these problems experiments were conducted at
the end of the vegetative period when the activity of all processes
comes to an end. These objective difficulties served as reasons for
optimal conditions in securing photochemically active chloroplasts of
Arabidopsis, which represent the subject of this study. For high
vegetative mass during the whole vegetative period flowers where
emasculated. For testing the activity of the chloroplasts the reaction
for restoration of ferrocyanide was measured. The present work
includes the study of the effects of Mg++, NH4 C1 and the (ADP + Pi)
system on the electron transport and photosynthetical phosphorylation
- noncyclic and cyclic.<p>

Arabidopsis thaliana race Enkheim was chosen as the subject of the
investigations. As it has been mentioned above, cells of Arabidopsis
contain acidic cellular sap which can be neutralized by two methods:
increasing the pH of the media or homogenisation of leaves with large
quantity of buffer for diluting the cellular sap (Hydrogen ions). Both
the variants were tried.<p>

Variant 1. Extraction media consisted of 0.02 M tris-HC1 buffer pH
8.6-8.8, 0.0001 M NaCl, 0.45 M sucrose, 0.0001 M EDTA, 1% serum
albumin. Leave samples were homogenised with small quantity of cold
buffer (3-4 ml buffer pH 8.6 for 1 g leaves). Homogenised material was
filtered and centrifuged 1-2 minutes at 1000 t/min. Sediments
containing cellular walls were discarded, supernatant was centrifuged
for 7 min. at 3000 t/min. Sediment was washed with small quantity of
buffer pH 7.8 and again centrifuged for 7 min at 3000 t/min. Sediments
of chloroplasts were resuspended in small quantity of buffer at pH 7.8
and used for the experiments.<p>

Variant 2. Extraction media consisted of 0.02 M tris HC1 buffer pH
7.8, 0.0001 M NaCl, 0.001 M EDTA, 0.45 M. sucrose. 1% serum albumin.
Leave samples were homogenised in large quantity of cold buffer (10-12
ml buffer pH 7.8 for 1 g leaves). The homogenised material was filtred
and centrifuged 1-2 min. at 1000 t/min. Supernatant was again
centrifuged for 7 min. at 3000 t/min. Sediments of chloroplasts were
resuspended in small quantity of buffer and used for the experiments.<p>

The reaction media for determining the restoration of ferrocyanide
consisted of 12.5 mkmol tris-HCl buffer pH 7.8, 0.02 M KCl, 0.003 M
MgCl 2, 5 mkmol K3Fe(CN6, 0.1 ml suspension of chloroplasts containing
40-60 mkg chlorophyll. On addition of equal volumes the 5%
3-chloracetate acid reaction wa stopped. For detrmining non-cyclic
photophosphorylation 5 mkmol ADP and 5 mkmol K2HPO4 were added to the
reaction media. K3Fe(CN6 which remained in oxidized condition restored
equimolecular quantity of ascorbic acid and ZnSO4. PMS 0.05 mkmol
acted as a cofactor for the cyclic phosphorylation. NH4Cl (10E-4M) was
used as disjunctor. Inorganic phosphorus was detrmined by Loury and
Lopey's method with modification of Honda (1956)<p>

The experiment showed that chloroplasts of Arabidopsis extracted by
the method of variant 1 mentioned above possessed extremely low
photochemical activity (restored 7.5 mkmol K3Fe(CN)6 in 1 mg
chlorophyll for 10 min.). Addition of Mg++ ions to the reaction media
did not increase the electron transport (Table 1).<p>

Table 1: The restoration of K3Fe(CN)6 by Arabidopsis thaliana
chloroplasts, extracted by two variants (mkmol K3Fe(CN)6 /mg
chlorophyll for 10 min.).<p>

This is explained as an unfavourable effect of an increased pH during
the early moment of chloroplast extraction (with homogenisation). The
experiment showed that the extraction media for chloroplasts of
Arabidopsis is considered as an optimal factor mentioned in variant 2.
In this case the chloroplasts showed high activity and with the
addition of Mg++ ions to the reaction media the electron transport is
increased appreciably.<p>

Further study on the activities of chloroplasts of Arabidopsis was
conducted on suspensions, extracted by second method. Addition of
substrates of phosphorylation (ADP + Pi) to the reaction media
accelerate the restoration of ferrocyanide 2 to 2.5 times in the
presence of Mg++ ions and in the absence of Mg++ (Table 2).<p>

Table 2: Photochemical activity of Arabidopsis thaliana chloroplasts
(mkmol K3Fe(CN)6/mg chlorophyll for 10 min.), (mkmol Pi/mg chlorophyll
for 10 min.).<p>

It proved that in chloroplasts isolated from the plants of
Arabidopsis, electron transport is accompanied by phosphorylation.
Additional introduction of the disjunctor NH4Cl to the reaction media
(ADP + Pi) practically do not increase the rate of electron transport
which represents probably the peculiarity of chloroplasts extracted
from Arabidopsis thaliana plants. However, transmembrane potential on
the membranes of chloroplasts of Arabidopsis completely removed by
phosphatacceptor system. Addition of disjunctor without substrates of
phosphorylation to a considerable extent enhance the restoration of
ferrocyanide.<p>

Chloroplasts of Arabidopsis are characterized with sufficiently high
level of photosynthetic phosphorylation - noncylic and cyclic. The
level of later is almost the double. Exclusion of Mg++ ions from the
reaction media decrease the photophosphorylation on an average by
20-30%. Disjunctor NH4Cl suppresses the cyclic photophosphorylation to
a greater extent than noncyclic.<p>

In this way the study has shown that for the extraction of
chloroplasts of Arabidopsis thaliana as mentioned in variant 2 the
optimum conditions are created in which the chloroplasts are
photochemically active.<p>
