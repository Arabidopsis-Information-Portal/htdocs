RPhI enzyme (RPhI, NF 5.3.1.6.) in Arabidopsis thaliana leaves of wild
type Enkheim and its mutants triplex and 58/15 is of different
activity (Babadzhanova and Bakaeva, 1980). Enzyme from triplex mutant
leaves shows the highest activity. The influence of temperature from
15*degrees*C up to 60*degrees*C on the native form of enzyme and its
subunits has been studied in order to explain the highest activity of
RPhI mutants.<p>

The enzyme cleaning was done according to the method, described
earlier (Bakaeva and Babadzhanova, 1982). RPhI activity was determined
by the carbazole method (Hurwitz et al., 1956. The protein content was
determined by the method of Lowry et al. (1951).<p>

Figure 1 represents data which show that RPhI of wild type leaves and
of mutant triplex has maximum activity at the temperature of
50*degrees*C-60*degrees*C, but RPhI of mutant 58/15 at the temperature
of 45*degrees*-50*degrees*C. Subunits of wild type and triplex enzyme
have maximum activity at the temperature of 45*degrees*-60*degrees*C,
but enzyme of mutant triplex at the temperature of
45*degrees-55*degrees*C. Apparently, enzyme of mutant 58/15
distinguishes by the high sensitivity to high temperatures.
representing data on the temperature influence on RPhI activity in
Arrhenius-coordinates, we obtained the lines with a bend at about
35*degrees*C (Figure 2).<p>

Figure 1: Dependence of specific activity of RPhI on temperature in A.
thaliana wild ltype (En) and its mutants (Tr and 58/15).<p>

The presence of a bend point in plots is apparently explained by the
fact that the energy of the enzyme activity, conditioned by variations
of the enzyme molecular conformation, vary for different objects and
different temperatures. To test this supposition we calculated
temperature coefficients Q, reactions and the energy of enzyme
activity E act. for low and high temperature regions.<p>

As it is seen from the Table 1, there is a regularity for all three
objects; the values Q 10 and E act. are less in the high temperature
region than in the low temperature one. These variations point to the
fact that the conformational RPhI molecular variations occur at the
certain temperature. The E act. value of RPhI in the low temperature
region is less in comparison with the wild type. In the high
temperature region mutant 58/15 has the least E act. value. RPhI
subunits of three forms have larger values of enzyme activity energy
and of the temperature coefficient both in the low and high
temperature regions.<p>

isomerization on the temperature<p>

Thus, according to our results we conclude that lowering the energy of
enzyme activity is one of the reasons of the high activity of RPhI
mutants<p>
