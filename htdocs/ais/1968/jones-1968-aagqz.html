<h2>Variation in flowering time of natural populations of Arabidopsis thaliana (L) HEYNH. with special reference to the breeding system</h2><p>

Investigations into the breeding system of British wild populations of
Arabidopsis were initiated on samples of seed collected in 1965 from
five randomly selected plants in each of the following six
populations.<p>

The plants were grown on a bench in the glasshouse (LAWRENCE, 1966),
in a completely randomized block experiment.  Measurements were taken
of days to flowering from an arbitrary date. The experiment was
terminated after 104 days, after which some plants still showed no
signs of flowering; these are referred to as late forms.<p>

The results of the analysis of variance showed that both populations
and families within populations differed significantly.  An indication
of the differences between populations is given by the population
means and variances:<p>

These fall into two distinct groups, populations 1, 2, 3, and 4 having
high means and variances, and populations 5 and 6 with comparatively
low means and variances. This shows good correlation with the origins
of the populations, populations 5 and 6 being essentially weed
populations which have probably been subject to strong directional
selection for early flowering by gardeners.<p>

The variation between families also shows marked heterogeneity
(BARTLET test for heterogeneity of variances P<0.001) (Figure 1).
This could be attributed to two factors.  One is that the result is
purely a scalar effect of the environment, family variance increasing
with family mean. The other is that the large variances of some
families are the result of segregation of the progeny of either a
bib-homozygous parent or a homozygote which had cross-pollinated with
other heterozygous individuals. Thus small family variances would
indicate that the parent was relatively homozygous and inbreeding.<p>

A certain scalar effect of the environment would be expected
especially in the very late families.  However, this cannot fully
account for: (1) The enormity of some of the variances, plants from a
single family flowering, for instance, over a period of up to 100
days; (2) The presence of families with similar means and widely
differing variances. The distribution of variation in populations
assuming all families are of this type, little segregation would be
expected, and if this were so, and these families were segregating,
this method of investigation would not be sensitive enough to detect
it.<p>

Further investigations were made on populations 5 and 6 on the progeny
of the first selfed generation.  Five individuals from each of the
five first generation families in each population were selected at
random and selfed. The selfed progeny were grown in a randomised block
experiment and their flowering time measured.  Each group of five
families originating from a single wild individual will be referred to
as a family group.  In the analysis of variance of this date both
populations and families within groups within populations were
significant. The item which is of interest is the between families
within groups item.  If there are significant differences between
selfed families which have originated from one parent plant, then this
is evidence that the progeny were segregating.  Each family group was
examined individully, the between family mean square being calculated
for each group separately and tested against the appropriate summed
within family mean square:<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol05/vol05-pg13-tab1.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

The significance of the between family mean squares of all but two
family groups shows that most of these selfed families have originated
from segregating parents.  This is positive evidence that the majority
of plants sampled from these populations were at least partially
heterozygous. Thus, despite the low family variances shown by these
populations in the previous experiment, it does not follow that
individuals undergo automatic self-pollination under natural
conditions.<p>

It is interesting to note that this type of situation maybe widespread
in natural populations of Arabidopsis.  Similar results to those found
in the first experiment described i.e. large within family variation,
have also been reported in German and Czechoslovakian populations by
NAPP-ZINN (1964) and DOBROVOLNA (1966) respectively, and also more
recently by ROBBELEN (personal communication).<p>
