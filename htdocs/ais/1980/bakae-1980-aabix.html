<h2>FRACTIONATION OF RIBOSEPHOSPHATEISOMERASE (RPI), PHOSPHORIBULOKINASE (PRK) AND RIBULOSEDIPHOSPHATECARBOXILASE (RDPC) FERMENT PREPARATIONS BY AMMONIA SULPHATE FROM ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA LEAVES, RACE ENKHEIM</h2><p>

It is very difficult to separate the carboxylic phase ferments of
photosynthesis RDPC (E.C.4.1.1.39), PRK (E.C.2.7.1.19) and RPI
(E.C.5.3.1.6.) during the purification process (Romanova, 1973).<p>

The object of our work was the determination of fractions saturated by
(NH4)2SO4, in which every enzyme shows its highest activity. Ferment
preparations from Arabidopsis thaliana leaves of race Enkheim were
obtained by the method described previously (Babadjanova et al.,
1971). Fractionation and saturation by ammonia sulphate were performed
in cold magnetic stirrer for one an hour. In order to release from
ammonia sulphate all fractions were dialyzed for 5 hours. The
quantitative protein content of the fractions was determined by
Lowry's method (Lowry et al., 1951). Enzyme activity was estimated by
the following methods: RDPC radiometrically (Romanova et al., 1958),
i.e. by using NaH14CO3 and ribulose-1,5-diphosphate as a substrate,
PRC by Hurwitz's method (Hurwtiz, 1962), RPI by the modified method of
Axelrod and Iang (1954).<p>

The percentage of protein yield depending on the degree of
(NH4)2SO4-saturation is shown in Figure 1-3. The highest quantity of
protein precipitates in the (NH4)2SO4-saturation range of 30 to 50
percent.<p>

Figure 1, 2, and 3: Enzyme activity of RDPC)1), PRK(2), and RPI(3) and
its dependence from (NH4)2SO4-saturation in preparations from
Arabidopsis thaliana leaves, race Enkheim.<p>

The detrmination of RDPC-activity in different fractions of saturation
by ammonia sulphate show that the highest activity is observed in
(NH4)2SO4-fractions of 35-45% (Figure 1). Results on the dependence of
PRK-activity on (NH4)2SO4-saturation degree are presented in Figure 2.
As it is shown there, PRK does not precipitate as RDPC in a narrow
zone of (NH4)2SO4-saturation because its high activity takes place in
the saturation range from 45% to 70%. Data of the RPI activity
determination in fractions obtained under different
(NH4)2SO4-saturation is demonstrated by Figure 3. High RPI-activity is
observed in a wide range of saturation by ammonia sulphate, i.e., from
40-80%.<p>

The results obtained prove that the RDPK-enzyme can be easily isolated
from the two other enzymes, while it is difficult to separate PRC and
RPI through fractionation with ammonia sulphate.<p>
