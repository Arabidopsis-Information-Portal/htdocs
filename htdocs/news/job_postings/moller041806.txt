Postdoctoral position in Plant Molecular and cell Biology

The University of Stavanger invites applications for a three-year post-doctoral position,
in Plant Molecular and Cell Biology, in the Department of Mathematics and Natural Sciences. 

The successful applicant will be part of a research team studying the molecular and cell 
biology of plastid division in Arabidopsis thaliana. We are particularly interested in 
(i) Identifying novel plastid division components using protein/protein interaction techniques, 
(ii) Isolating regulatory proteins of genes encoding central plastid division proteins and 
(iii) Cloning novel plastid division suppressor mutants showing altered plastid morphology. 

The project is technically and intellectually demanding and applicants should therefore 
have a PhD and background in plant molecular and cell biology.
