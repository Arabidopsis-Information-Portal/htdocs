Though higher plants are relatively rich in RNA, the quantitative
determination of the nucleic acid content poses several problems, and
no ideal methods can be found in the literature (cf. INGLE, 1963).
The results vary not only from organism to organism but also from
tissue to tissue within the same organism (HOLDGAGE and GOODWIN,
1965).<p>

In our laboratory we found, in agreement with the literature, that
crude digests obtained with the SCHMIDT and THANNHAUSER (1945)
procedure were not satisfactory if fresh or freeze-dried rosettes of
Arabidopsis were used.  Considerable improvement can be attained if
the extract is further purified by Dowex 1 x 8,200 mesh resin in
chloride or formate form.  A sharp maximum can be observed in the acid
eluate at 260 m micro but the O.D. 260/234 ratio is generally
2.10-2.20 indicating the presence of considerable amount of
non-nucleic acid derivatives.  Very high degree of purity can be
obtained by chromatographic separation of individual nucleotides on
Dowex 1-8, 200 mesh, formate form with a procedure similar to that of
MARKHAM (1955).<p>

The essential steps of the preparation (adapted from MILLIKAN and
PICKETT, 1964; HOLDGATE and GOODWIN, 1965) are the following:<p>

Figure 1: Dowex eluate of Arabidopsis RNA hydrolysate.  C. denotes
cytidylic acid (sometimes the 2' and 3' isomers are separated), A
designates adenylic acid with the 2' and 3' isomers of guanylic acid.
The firt two peaks contain relatively small quantities of bases and
nucleosides.<p>

The purity of individual nucleotides appeared remarkably good (Table
