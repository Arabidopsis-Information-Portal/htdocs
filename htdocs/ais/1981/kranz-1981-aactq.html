INTRODUCTION<p>

Previous investigations in Arabidopsis have indicated remarkable
similarity in quantum requirement of the blue and far red wave length
photoreceptors to first floral induction (Brown and Klein, 1971;
Velikanov et al., 1971; Vince-Pru, 1975). In addition,
5-bromodeoxyuridine, an analogue of thymidine in DNA-synthesis, proved
to be a strong promoter of flowering under non-inductive photoperiods
(Redei et al., 1974; Kranz, 1979, 1980, 1981).<p>

Presently, however, the information of the photobiochemical background
of the flowering process is incomplete. Our present study is concerned
with attempts to characterize and explain the interaction between the
photoinduction and certain steps of the thymidine metabolism during
floral induction of selected lines of Arabidopsis (Pr-0, ch 2/ch 2).<p>

MATERIAL AND METHODS<p>

The kinetics of the flowering response of Arabidopsis thaliana has
been investigated previously (Kranz, 1979, 1980, 1981) and in the
present study under variant photoperiods, interfering light of
different quality as well as with treatment of DNA base analogue
compounds at low non-mutagenic doses (10E-4 to 10E-5M). All plants
were grown from the seed on Redei's synthetic medium plus
caseinhydrolysate (1g/1) and IAA (10E-6M), and all experiments were
performed in growth chambers at 20+/- 1*degree*C, 60 +/- 5% rel.
humidity, and under the noninductive light conditions of short day
photoperiods (9L/15D hrs.); the spectral quanta distribution is shown
in Table 1. More details of the experimental conditions are given by
the legends of the tables and figures below.<p>

flowering plants in the compared two samples, n1 and n2 are respective
sample sizes (at least 40 to 50 plants per sample); 820.8 is a
constant representing the parametric variance of the distribution of
arcsine transformations of proportions. Test statistics for linear
regression Y = a+bX and correlation coefficient r were as usual. For
calculation programmed in BASIC the pocket computter SHARP PC 1211
connected with tape recorder and printer CE 122 was used.<p>

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS<p>

In the previous step of our studies the effect of red (R)/far red(FR)
interfering light during the night of noninductive short day (SD)
photoperiods was investigated (Kranz, 1979, 1980). Interfering
FR-light in comparison to R-light reduced the time until flowering of
50 p.c. of the plants in Pr-0 for 5 days as a mean, and in ch2/ch2
floral induction was obtained only by interfering FR. Evidently, the
competence of FR-light was specifically timed during the night period
and during the development of the seedling since the promotion of the
flowering was maximum after 4 hrs dark and at the end of the first
week after sowing.<p>

Figure 2: Effect of variant doses of thymidine (1-E-1 to 10E-5M) on
the flowering (% plants with first flower open) and the vegetative
development (mean number of rosette leaves per plant) of Arabidopsis
at different days (15th and 25th day rsp. 44th and 46th day) after
seeding.<p>

Similar effects were induced upon additional treatment by the base
analogue 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) fed through the aseptic medium
(Kranz, 1981). The result confirmed that BrdU is the stronger induced
of flowering than the most effective interfering light (FR).
Furthermore, there were specific responses of the genotype involved
upon BrdU treatment ranging from zero effect in other wild ecotypes
than Pr-O to delayed responses during development. Additional
experiments now underway have shown that the sensitivity for BrdU is
variable in the material of the AIS-seed bank, thus high as well as
low sensitive lines can be selected by using the AMES test for this
and other antibiotics.<p>

Moreover, in agreement to the earlier findings of the Columbia group
(Redei, 1974) the BrdU-effect on flowering can be nullified by
thymidine, the normal nucleoside of DNA. An experiment with different
ratios of BrdU to thymidine applied at variant doses yielded an
optimum when the last compound was fed two times in excess against the
analogue (Figure 1); higher amounts of thymidine in relation to BrdU
reduced flowering.<p>

Since thymidine can be used for inhibiting DNA-synthesis specifically
during the cell cycle of eucaryotic cells (Lewin, 1980), we tested the
dose effect of this compound on flowering (Figure 2). Whereas the
highest concentration (10E-1M) was lethal for the seedlings maximum
leaf production and flowering was produced at the range of 10E-3 to
10E-4M. Furthrmore, at this dose range only flowering was
significantly higher than thymidineless control.<p>

Figure 3: Flowering of the mutant ch2/ch2 (open circles) and the wild
ecotype Pr-O (filled circles) at 41th and 47th day after sowing under
noninductive SD-photoperiods (9L/15D hrs.) plus continuous
BrdU-treatment (0.5 x 10E-5 M) through the aseptic medium with
interfering blue light during the night (45 min after 4
hrs. D). Treatment of blue light was started from the first, third
and so on until 21st day after sowing.<p>

Consequently, the next step of our experiments was to study the
photosensitized flowering through timed feedings of BrdU under
treatment of interfering blue light (B) (Kranz, 1979). By the low
quanta emission applied for B (Table 1) this interfering light could
not be effective in the light energy mode via phytochroms (Pfr); but a
blue light receptor (Pb) like putative cryptochroms (Gressel, 1979)
may have been involved.<p>

In the meantime developmental phase specificity of the B-effect upon
flowering under BrdU-treatment was also obtained (Figure 3). In both
genotypes studied promotion of flowering was maximum and earliest by
treatments of interfering B-light started from the first week after
sowing; ts-values compared to control are highly significant at
probability levels of *alpha*<<0.01. Calculation of regression lines
proves that the number of rosette leaves, which is a morphological
estimate for the vegetative stage before flowering, and the time until
first flowering are positively correlated (2*alpha*<<.001 for
significance of r against zero). This proves the high competence of
the experimental interaction of the inductive factors BrdU and B by
which, evidently, the differential process of the apical meristem is
directly affected.<p>

CONCLUSION<p>

Generally, the transformation of the vegetative to the generative
stage of higher plants depends obviously on gene activation, limited
DNA synthesis and the RNA-mediated stimulation of the uridine and
thymidine metabolism in the peripheral cells of the vegetation tip.
Thus, Nakashima (1973) was able to show that in the LD-plant Lemna
gibba G3 phytochrome works via thymidine metabolism for floral
induction. In Pharbitis the rate of 3H-methylthymidine incorporation
increased in two waves following floral induction (Zilberstein et al.,
1973).<p>

Since DNA-pyrimidines are photosensitive compounds, and the thymidine
analogue BrdU of our experiments having an absorption at *lambda*max =
283 +/-37 nm is ineffective on flowering in complete darkness, we have
studied in the meantime the interaction of single UV-irradiation, at
an intensity (160 mW for *lambda* = 254 nm) just below that of death rate
of the cells, and of BrdU under SD-periods. Preliminary results showed
that the promotion of flowering was stronger in the presence of BrdU,
though flowering was not significantly increased in comparison to the
UV-free control. This gives some evidence for the probability that the
photoreceptor of interfering light cannot be simply identical with the
UV absorbing BrdU.<p>

Adams et al., (1976).<p>

Summarizing the experimental data we conclude that the FR- as well as
the B-photosensor and the nucleic acid base analogue BrdU work via
thymidine on the DNA synthesis. The putative action of the
photosensors (Pfr, Pb) may be concerned with the biosynthetic step
from deoxy-thymidinemonophosphate (dTMP) to deoxy-thymidinediphosphate
(dTDP, 3 in Figure 4) which is probably regulated by this most
important rate determining thymidine kinase (Adams et al., 1976).
Since promotion of flowering was maximum with interaction between BrdU
and interfering B- or FR-light, it would be logical to assume that the
interaction may be controlled by a photochemical process mediated
through Pfr and B.<p>

In the presence of low non-mutagenic BrdU-doses (0.5 x 10E-5M) the
step from deoxy-uridinemonophosphate (dUMP) to dTMP is blocked with is
controlled by the thymidilate synthetase (reaction 1 in Figure 4). When UV is
absorbed by higher amounts of BrdU incorporation (above 10E-3M) than
those of our experiments the way in Figure 4 marked by radiation hv
(313 nm) runs to decoded DNA yielding transitions (mutations) of the
genetic material. However, blocking of step dUMP to dTMP by BrdU may
stimulate the photochemical rate-determining activity of the
thymidine-kinase (reaction 3 in Figure 4). Thus, a modified pattern of
thymidine phosphorylation results which opens the pathway for
thymidine (dTP to dTMP) and, finally, for the limited DNA synthesis
of the transforming apical meristem.<p>

This pattern can be significantly changed by adding thymidine at a
specific molecular ratio to BrdU to the cultures which results in
remarkable prolongation of the vegetative stage of the shoot apex
(Figure 1). While there may be a little effect on the enzymes during
the early period of growth, the thymidine kinase activity remains
elevated for a longer period (Adams et al., 1976). Whereby the cell
differentiation of the shoot does not change to the generative stage.
Feeding of the thymidine in excess (Figure 2) through the BrdU-free
medium, however, inhibits the DNA synthesis to the limited rate which
transforms the meristem of the shoot apex from vegetative to
generative cells.<p>

Though the low amount and the instability of the enzymes involved is,
presently, an obstacle for their biochemical preparation from the tiny
vegetative tips of Arabidopsis, the thesis presented may stimulate
future work for combining the vast amount of photophysiological data
on flowering with more detailed biochemical findings on the thymidine
interconversions.<p>

SUMMARY<p>

Present study indicates remarkable similarity between the blue or far
red mediated first floral induction and the strong promotion of
flowering affected by 5-bromodeoxyuridine, an analogue of thymidine in
DNA synthesis. In summarizing the experimental data conclusion is made
that the photosensors as well as the nucleic acid base analogue work
via thymidine on the DNA synthesis which at specific, limited rate
transforms the apical meristem from vegetative to generative cells.<p>
