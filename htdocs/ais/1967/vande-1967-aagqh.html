<h2>Non-recessive embryonic lethals as revealed by reciprocal crosses between EMS treated and control plants</h2><p>

	After 5 days at 1*degree*C on wet filterpaper (to break dormancy) and 24 hrs drying at 24*degrees*C, seeds of Landsberg-'erecta' were treated with 10 mM EMS (unbuffered, 24 hrs 24*degrees*C), followed by 5 min rinsing. This dose leads to about 50% non-fertilized ovulae (control 10%), but it gives little if any reduction in germination % (agar) and survival, while conspicuous somatic effects up to the time of flowering are rare.<p>

	MULLER's embryo-test was applied to the 4th and 5th fruits (for ease of handling on one side of the septum only), and consequently also the different crosses to be reported had to be made on flowers 4 and 5.  Mutant frequency is given as % of seeds which contain embryonic lethals and as % chlorophyll mutants among non-lethal embryos (Cf. MULLER's mc and m'c).  Greyish white, greyish green, etc. embryos, which often go with smaller and/or deformed seeds, were classified by me as embryonic lethals.  The results of one of the experiments (August 1966) are given in the table:<p>

	Additional data are:  (1) C x C (between plants) gives the same results as C selfed, except for a very small increase in non-fertilized ovulae, (2) EMS x EMS (between plants) equals EMS x C (except for some increase in sterility), which shows that allelic mutations (e.g., included in overlapping transmissable deletions) are infrequent, and (3) artificial within-flower selfings, closely mimicking the mechanical damage in crossing, gave for both C and EMS plants the same results as the corresponding natural selfings.  It follows that the reciprocal difference in embryonic lethals between C x EMS and EMS x C cannot be ascribed to susceptibility of EMS flowers to mechanical damage. The difference in mutant %'s between C and C x EMS is probably due to sampling fluctuations, and there is no reciprocal difference in % of chlorophyll mutants. The high sterility of C x EMS is caused by the reduced availability and quality of EMS-pollen (per pollination, pollen from only one flower was used).<p>

	The class of embryonic lethals in EMS x C (after correction with the C-level still over 30% of the lethals in EMS-selfed) are not due to recessive mutations, and their spectrum shows, compared with EMS-selfed, a relative decrease of late embryonic lethals and a considerable rel. increase in early ones (such a shift is not induced by mechanical damage).  Possible explanations are, apart from autonomous effects of the embryo cytoplasm, and apart from endosperm-embryo incompatibility connected with a phenotypic contrast AA+ versus A++:<p>

(1)  dominant embryonic lethals which are not transmitted by the male gametes (N.B. dominant chlorophyll mutations are rare), and<p>

(2)  a maternal physiological effect, such that, e.g., the feeding function of the nucellus is impaired by nuclear and/or plasmatic damage in the EMS mother plants.<p>

	The latter explanation seems somewhat more attractive, as the reciprocal difference is restricted to embryonic lethality, and the lethals do not occur in some plants only.  It might then be possible to reduce this class of non-recessive lethals by modifying the environment.  However, winter experiments (low light intensity) gave similar figures (6.0-8.0%) as the summer experiments.  Non-recessive embryonic lethals might affect comparisons between different mutagen dosages, between different treatment modifications, and between different mutagens. Further attempts to distinguish between the different hypotheses are in progress.<p>
