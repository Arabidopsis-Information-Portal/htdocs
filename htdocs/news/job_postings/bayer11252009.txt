Germany Ph.D. Student Position

Multi-cellular organisms rely on a robust network of temporal and
spatial coordinates to guide the development from a single cell during
embryogenesis. Various species have evolved different strategies to
obtain such information from external and internal cues. At present,
little is known about how higher plants establish cell polarity during
embryogenesis.

In our research group we are studying molecular signaling pathways
that guide embryonic patterning in the model organism Arabidopsis
thaliana. We are focusing on sperm-derived factors that link the onset
of embryogenesis with the fertilization event.

For molecular characterization of candidate genes we are looking for a
highly motivated Ph.D. student.
Candidates most hold a diploma or masters degree in biology or related
fields and are expected to have a broad knowledge in molecular biology
and/or genetics. Experience in plant developmental biology would be an
asset.

We are offering a scientifically stimulating surrounding and an
enjoyable lab atmosphere in a highly interactive international
team. The position is part of the International PhD program of the Max
Planck Institute (MPI) for Developmental Biology which offers
outstanding training in a broad spectrum of cutting-edge scientific
research. The program provides students an interdisciplinary practical
and theoretical training during their PhD research, particularly
through common introductory courses, symposia and research seminars.
