Flowering time differences in the population samples from independent,
spatially well isolated localities, were studied in our main
experiments (Cetl, Dobrovolna and Effmertova, 1969; Cetl, 1976).
Sampling of less isolated natural material has been undertaken only
recently to study human effects on the flowering time variability
(Cetl, 1977). In some natural localities in the Moravian lowlands A.
thaliana occurs in more or less continuous areas giving us the
possibility of studying flowering time differences in systematically
ordered series of "subpopulations" within those large populations in
order to comprehend their internal differentiation.<p>

First samples of such kind were gathered in the Bobrava river valley,
southwest of Brno. Two similar transects were led on the left Bobrava
bank 120 meters (transect No. 1) and 60 meters (transect No. 2)
eastwards of Novy Mlyn in the direction of inclination lines,
beginning with litoral bushes 8 meters above the river level,
continuing over steppe phytocoenoses (Festucetum), and ending at a
Quercetum margin 48 meters above the river level. The distance of
individual sampling areas within the same transect was 4 metrs. Mature
seeds from minimum 25 plants were collected in each sampling area. A
random sample of approximately 120 plants was studied in each
"subpopulation". Results of laboratory examinations at 25*degrees*C
under continuous illumination (1250 lux) were given in percent of
plants appearing flower primordia up to 28 days after emergence (Cetl,
1978).<p>

The changes in the percent of generative plants in dependence on
height above the river level seem to be similar along the two
transects. The percent of generative plants was low in the
"subpopulations" from lowest and highest sampling areas while maximum
frequency of generative plants occurred in intermediate positions. The
only difference between the two transects consisted in a less
expressed maximum in the transect No. 2 (Figure 1).<p>

The homogeneity of the results seems t be higher in the horizontal
direction<p>

The material used is apparently unsuitable for detecting random
internal differentiation of "subpopulations" within large population
due to random drift as a consequence of the dispersive process. The
differences between "subpopulations" seem to be clearly non random due
to fine differentiation in microrelief, microclimate, and accompanying
plant species along inclination lines, i.e., in vertical direction.<p>

More adequate material to understand internal differentiation in large
populations, level of their subdivision, and other attributes of the
dispersive process in A. thaliana should be searched for in natural
material of habitats more homogenous in respect to environment.<p>
