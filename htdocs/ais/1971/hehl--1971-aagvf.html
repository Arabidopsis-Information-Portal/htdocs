<h2> Quantitative modifications of the phytochrome trigger mechanism in seed dormancy of homoallelic genotypes</h2><p>

The wildtype En-2 and two homoallelic chlorina mutants, ch1 and ch2,
of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) HEYNH., which are quantitatively
deficient in chlorophyll b, were cultivated in a growth chamber during
six consecutive generations under continuous yellow light (lambda
&gt; 
550 nm, ~4.10 microwatts * cm**-2 * 10 nm*-1).  The
seed dormancy of the wild type ch+/ch+ decreased significantly from
the I1 to I6 generation, but in the seeds of the ch1/ch1- and
ch2/ch2-types significant dormancy was never observed (KRANZ, 1970).
Therefore, experiments were started to analyse this different
germination behaviour.<p>

AMEN (1968) proposed a model that embodies a hormonal regulation of
four phases of dormancy: an inductive, a maintenance, a trigger and a
germination mechanism.  The available experimental evidence indicates
that the "triggering agent" is a photochemical reaction and / or a
thermochemical one, while the other mechanisms are under hormonal
control exclusively.  For the photochemical reaction the pytochrome
mechanism appears to be mainly responsible (MANCINELLI, BORTHWICH and
HENDRICKS, 1966).  Hence, the first part of our experiments was to
investigate the phytochrome system within the seed material pretreated
with yellow light.<p>

Applied methods: seed germination in one-way-petri-dishes on wet
filter paper after cold pretreatment at 5*degrees*C for 24 hours,
subsequent radiation treatment under constant climate (25 +/-
2*degrees*C, 60 +/- 8% rel. humid.) with the plexiglass filters: far
red (FR) ROHM and HAAS 700 (lambda  &gt;  750 nm, ~1.02 microwatts * cm**-2
* 40 nm**-1) and red (R) ROHM and HAAS 501 (lambda &gt; 650 nm, ~4.40
microwatts * cm**-2 * 20 nm**-1)<p>

Figure 1: Relative values of seed germination depending on different
R/FR-treatments examined during six consecutive generations of three
homoallelic genotypes.<p>

The results are summarized in Figure 1 giving the relative values of
seed germination seven days after sowing for six consecutive
generations.  While the seeds of the Io still developed under normal
light, those of I1 to I5 grew under the yellow light.  The germination
of the mutants was significantly better than that of the wildtype.
For seed which ripened under yellow light, the germination time
decreased from I2 to I6 in the dark control and under the far red
filter.  This means that the quantitative modifications of the seed
dormancy induced by yellow light, can be broken up by the red/far red
radiation.  Subsequent treatment of FR (2 minutes) after R (48 hours)
probably yields the best results.  But there are large differences
between the wildtype and the mutants. The mutants differ significantly
after FR treatment and in the dark control. The ch2/ch2 mutant
containing small amounts of chlorophyll b stands intermediate between
the normal ch+/ch+ and the b-less ch1/ch1.<p>

Evidently, the phytochrome dependent trigger mechanism is influenced
by the chromosomal gene ch which mainly affects the contents of
chlorophyll b in the plants.  We are now starting experiments to
analyse the effect of plant hormones (GA3, ABA, Kinetin), which may
interact with the phytochrome system and these genotypes.  Hence, new
information can be expected (CHEN and OSBORNE, 1970) on the hormone
and/or gene dependent regulation system using m-RNA which is stored
and/or synthesized de novo in the embryo.<p>
