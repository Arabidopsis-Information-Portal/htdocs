Vol 01S: <h2>On the Chimerical Structure of M1 Plants</h2><p>

A. J. MULLER<p>

After treatment of seeds with mutagenic agents the M1 plants will be
mericlinal chimeras for any mutations so induced. For a random sample
of 255 M1 plants representing chimeras with regard to induced
recessive lethal mutations the distribution of the mutated sectors in
the inflorescences has been studied by analysing the embryos of each
silique. The results show that the size of the mutated apical sector
changes nearly always in the course of development of the reproductive
apex. In the course of 20 plastochrones the mutated sector had been
displaced from the apex in 34% of all apical chimeras; the non-mutated
sector had been displaced in 28% of apical chimeras. Thus with
progressive development the frequency of M1 plants with a mutated
sector in the shoot apex diminishes, whereas the mean size of the
mutated apical sector increases. In sufficiently large populations the
product "number of apices with a mutated sector x mean size of the
mutated sector" remains constantly. On an average, the mutated sector
has no developmental disadvantage.<p>

As a consequence of the instability of apical chimeras very different
patterns of distribution of the mutated tissue occur (e.g., all the
flowers of the main inflorescence are mutated, or only one flower is
mutated, or only the flowers of some lateral inflorescences are
mutated, etc.). Therefore, it is not possible to calculate the number
of initial cells from the total segregation ratio in the progeny of a
M1 plant. The investigations have been published in detail elsewhere

Discussion:<p>

Van der VEEN: How do you determine the position of the fruits for your
topographies?<p>

MULLER: In the diagrams a 5/13 phyllotaxis is taken as a basis.  This
corresponds with the general picture obtainable by investigation of
buds. Plants which showed obvious deviations from this normal 5/13
phyllotaxis in the main inflorescence have been excluded from the
investigation.<p>

Van der VEEN: Well, one is obviously able to find as an average a 3/8
fruit phyllotaxis. But I have not been able to find any single plant
with this regular phyllotaxis all over its development.  Often a fruit
is "missing" or there is an "extra" fruit.<p>

MULLER: In studying the elongated shoot axis instead of the buds we
have to take into consideration the secondary torsion of shoot axis.
The dimensions of the torsion between two nodes depends on the length
of the internode.<p>

Van der VEEN: I found it convenient to follow the ribs (vascular
bundles) in dried plants to correct for this torsion. Then one always
gets unambiguous sectors. This is efficient in mutagen treated plants
too. With Dr. REDEIs mutant "erecta" we found very little torsion.<p>

ROBBELEN: How can, Dr. MULLER, the overlapping of two mutations in one
plant be understood, which you showed in one slide? I think it must be
explained as an overlapping in one silique, but not in one archespore
cell; for that would give double mutants and these were not recovered?<p>

Van der VEEN: In these chimeric fruits, of course, you didn't find a
3:1 segregation, but rather a pronounced deficit of each mutant type,
since selfpollination is per flower and not per half flower.<p>

MULLER: It is clear that we are concerned with an overlapping of two
sectors in one flower. The phenotypes found in such a silique progeny
were: 18 normal, 3 vana, and 2 xantha. I have demonstrated this case
in order to show that such overlappings occur. Therefore we have to
conclude that overlappings also take place between non-mutated and
mutated sectors. In this case a deficit of mutants may be expected.
Indeed, we found in siliques localized at the border of a mutated
sector a statistically significant deficit of mutants. - It may be
mentioned that with the lethal mutations it is hardly possible to
recognize double mutants. Double mutants correspond phenotypically
with the mutation having the earlier lethal phase (e.g., vn vn xa xa
has the phenotype "vana").<p>

Van der VEEN: Do you find cases where a sector has a mutant alpha and
another (neighboured) sector has not only alpha (I mean the same
genotype!) but also beta? We found this in tomato and Arabidopsis.
This could mean that alpha was induced on the chromosome level and
beta on the chromatid level. The two sectors then derived from one
cell.<p>

MULLER: I also found such cases; one was a chlorophyll mutation and
the other a very early embryonic lethal. The explanation could also be
that we are dealing with a point mutation on the one side and a
chromosomal aberration on the other.<p>
