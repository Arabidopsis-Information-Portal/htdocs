*  There has been a lot of interest recently in the revived use of "tissue 
printing" as a way of rapidly locating specific molecules in particular cells 
or tissues within the plant.  By cleanly cutting the material in question 
and pressing it firmly onto a membrane, commonly nitrocellulose, a print 
of the cut face is obtained.  This is formed by soluble molecules released 
at the surface that bind irreversibly to the membrane.  The print, which is 
remarkably faithful to the original anatomy, can then be probed with a 
variety of localising reagents or probes.  These have included antibodies 
to localise cell-wall glycoproteins (Cassab & Varner 1987.  J. Cell. Biol. 
105, 2581-2588) and nucleic acid probes to look at the expression of 
mRNAs encoding cell-wall proteins (Ye & Varner 1991. The Plant Cell 3, 
23-27).

*  We have adapted this simple technique to begin to screen for cell 
surface mutants in Arabidopsis, but we feel that the method has much 
wider potential as a general screening strategy.  We have a panel of 
monoclonal antibodies that recognise a variety of cell surface 
macromolecules including pectins, plasma membrane-associated 
arabinogalactan proteins, and extensin-like proteins.  By probing tissue 
prints of flowering stems with these antibodies, we can rapidly screen 
under a simple binocular microscope for two classes of mutant: one in 
which the corresponding antigen, e.g., extensin, is either over- or 
under-expressed and the other in which the antigen is expressed, but is 
in an inappropriate place.  This kind of subtlety in screening is probably 
rather difficult to do in any other way.  In theory, a wide range of plant 
parts can be used for printing including stems, leaves and seeds.  
Caution must be exercised in that any variant plant selected must be 
further screened using conventional tissue sections.  This is because a 
reduced abundance of antigen, extensin for example, on a tissue print 
may reflect either a genuinely lower level in the tissue, or a normal level, 
but with increased insolubilisation in the cell wall, thus reducing the 
soluble pool available for tissue printing.  We have been screening for 
mutants that have altered expression of pectin, AGPs and extensin-like 
proteins.  The variants we have found so far are clearly distinguishable 
from the wild type (see Figure).  One person could reasonably tissue 
print about 160 plants per hour, but in fact, boredom would probably limit 
you to fully printing and screening more than 300 or so plants a day with 
any one probe.  The protocol we have settled on is given below.

1.  SELECTION OF CELL WALL MUTANTS USING TISSUE PRINT 
TECHNIQUE
  (i) Sow M2 Arabidopsis seed (we are using EMS mutagenised material), 
1 seed per well, in 60-well seed trays.  Water compost before sowing.  
Suspend seed in water and transfer individually by pipette.  Cover seed-
tray with domed plastic cover.  Do not water again until after germination.
  (ii) Grow plants in a controlled environment room at 22oC, 16 h 
daylength, 50% relative humidity.
   (iii) After 6 weeks, use floral stems for tissue printing.
  (iv) Prepare nitrocellulose sheet (S & S brand) by soaking in 0.2 M 
CaCl2 and blotting dry (1 cm wide strip for each antibody to be tested).
  (v) Cut floral stem from plant between 1st and 2nd node.  Press firmly 
onto the nitrocellulose for 2 sec, 3 times per nitrocellulose strip.  If 
making multiple strip for probing with different antibodies, cut fresh face 
before moving on to the next strip.
   (vi) Block all protein-binding sites on the nitrocellulose by incubating 
with 10% sheep serum in phosphate buffered saline for 1 h.  Add 0.1% 
sodium azide to inhibit endogenous peroxidases.  Carry out all 
incubations at r.t. with agitation.
  (vii) Replace blocking buffer with a 20-fold dilution of rat hybridoma 
culture supernatant containing antibodies in PBS with 10% sheep 
serum and 0.1% sodium azide.  Incubate for 2 h.
  (viii) Wash in PBS, 3 times 10 min.
  (ix) Incubate for 1 h with a 2000-fold dilution of anti-rat IgG linked to 
horseradish peroxide in PBS with 10% sheep serum (no azide).
  (x) Wash in PBS, 3 times 10 min.
  (xi) Add peroxide substrate to give blue colour at binding site.  Make 
substrate up immediately before use. 25 ml H2O + 5 ml methanol 
containing 3 ugml-1 4-chloro-1- napthol + 30 ul 6% hydrogen peroxide.  
The colour should develop within 5 min.
  (xii) Wash extensively with H2O.
  (xiii) Dry and examine under binocular microscope.
 *  The first print will usually contain a lot of chlorophyll but the second (or
third print for abundant  antigens) will clearly reveal any differences in
amount or position of antigen. 

2.  OTHER APPLICATIONS
 *  The method transfers soluble molecules of all sorts to the membrane, 
and different  membranes e.g., nitrocellulose, charged or non-charged 
nylon, can be used to immobilise  most of them.  Thus, in principle, one 
could screen for variation not only in soluble  proteins/glycoproteins, but 
also in soluble polysaccharides, glycolipids, nucleic acids and  enzyme 
activities.  Reagents with which to probe the tissue prints might include 
not only  polyclonal antisera or monoclonal antibodies and nucleic acid 
probes, but also enzyme  substrates, labelled ligands of various sorts 
and labelled lectins.

Donovan).  A plant that shows much reduced expression is arrowed.
