<h2>THE GENETIC BASIS OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS: GENERAL DEFINITIONS</h2><p>

P.D. USMANOV<p>

During the All-Union Symposium on "Genetic Aspects of Photosynthesis"
in October, 1972, at Dushanbe, we stressed the necessity of a general
discussion on the topic "What is Genetics of Photosynthesis?"
Selected papers of the symposium have been published recently (NASYROV
and SESTAK, 1975).  The significance of such discussion was expressed
by many participants in connection with the formation of new
directions in the biological research, the so-called "Genetics of
Photosynthesis" compiling a number of biological sciences; botany,
physiology, biochemistry, biophysics, and plant genetics.
Unfortunately, the discussion had not taken place, so we have the task
now to consider a number of phenomena, defined as genetics of
photosynthesis.  However, it is worth it to point out that any
definitions have almost no significance for science, because new
scientific discoveries as a rule bring to light their drawbacks. But
it is a fact that definitions may have a wide practical use; moreover,
they can even be only useful when they will be not more than they can
stand for us. Thus, any attempt to define the genetics of
photosynthesis will contribute to make a system for our knowledge and
for further sicientific research.<p>

One of the main fields of plant genetics, the genetics of
photosynthesis (g.ph.), covers the investigation of the phenomena of
inheritance, as well as the variability of structures and functions of
the photosynthetic apparatus at different levels of life organization
(Figure 1).  One of the main tasks of g.ph. is to study the
inheritance of chloroplasts, elucidation of the nature of genes,
plastogenes and also their interactions in the course of formation and
activity of the photosynthetic apparatus. G.ph. is also aimed at the
investigation of different type variability of photosynthesis
including phylotgenetic variability of chloroplasts from different
taxonomic groups of plants, as well as the ontogenetic, paratypical,
i.e., variability of chloroplasts caused by the variations of
environmental conditions, mutational and the combinational one. All
these characteristics are investigated b g.ph. at different levels of
life organization: molecular-genetical (the objects for investigations
are biologically active and autoreproducing macromolecules),
ontogenetical (i.e., ontogenesis of an individual), population one
(i.e., combination of plants of one species, occupying a certain area
of biosphere), biogeocenotypical or biospherical (communities of
populations of plants, animals and micro-organisms, their interactions
between them and inert components of media; at this level the
photosynthesizing organisms play the role of one of the main
geochemical factors, forming the biosphere).  On this basis we have
worked out the scheme, which, in our opinion, contains all types of
investigations on the genetical basis of photosynthesis. We hope, this
scheme might be helpful for the evaluation of a general state of
investigation on g.ph., as well as working out the individual and
complex programs of investigations on the genetic basis of
photosynthesis.<p>

In conclusion we have another important question: is it possible to
establish the date in the history of photosynthetic research when
g.ph. was born? If we take into consideration that g.ph. is based
mainly on the study of photosynthetic apparatus, we come to the
conclusion that probably C. CORRENS and E. BAUER are the founders of
g.ph., as they had the priority in the discovery of cytoplasmic
inheritance.  It was in 1909 when they showed that chloroplasts do
possess their own genetic information, which counts for their genetic
succession and continuity.<p>
