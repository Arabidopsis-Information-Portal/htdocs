Postdoctoral Research Associate - Plant growth and biofuel attributes 

A postdoctoral position is available in the laboratory of Sam Hazen at the University of Massachusetts 
to investigate the systems level regulation of growth rate and biomass accumulation in grasses. The 
position is part of a DOE collaborative project with Steve Kay (UCSD), John Mullet (Texas A&M), and 
Todd Mockler (DDPSC). The project seeks to identify gene networks that underlie daily growth patterns 
and cell wall biosynthesis in Brachypodium distachyon. Expected experimental techniques will test 
protein-DNA interactions, cell wall morphology and composition, growth dynamics, and involve real-time 
monitory of gene expression. A recent Ph.D. in plant biology, molecular genetics or a related field is 
required. Initial appointment is for one year and is renewable for up to three years depending upon 
satisfactory performance and availability of funds. 

The Hazen laboratory will soon move to a new state-of-the-art science building as part of an 
interdisciplinary research cluster to address standing questions in biofuel feedstock development. The 
University of Massachusetts is located in Amherst, which is often mentioned as one of the top college 
towns and neighbors the city of Northampton, an artistic, musical, and countercultural hub.
