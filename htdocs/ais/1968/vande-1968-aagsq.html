<h2>Linear EMS-dose response for induced lethals, including maternally conditioned embryonic lethals.</h2><p>

After 5 days on wet filterpaper at 2*degrees*C (to break dormancy) and
redrying on filter paper (24 hrs, 24*degrees*C), seeds of Landsberg
'erecta' were treated with 0.0, 2.5, 5.0 7.5, 10.0, 12.5, 15.0 and
17.5 mM EMS (not buffered, 24 hrs, 24*degrees*C, dark).  After 5 min
rinsing-off with tapwater, the seeds were put on agar, and the
seedlings were treated as described earlier (Van der VEEN, 1965, 1967
a).<p>

From a random sample of 100 M1 plants per item, fruits No. 5 and 6
were used to apply MULLER's embryo-test, i.e., to score the fertility
(% of ovules fertilized), embryonic lethals (% of seeds containing
lethal embryos), and chlorophyll mutants (% among non-lethal embryos).
In addition, flowers No. 5 and 6 (or 6 and 7) of a random sample of 40
M1-plants per item were pollinated with pollen from the untreated
control.<p>

The results are given in the Figure.  E.L. refers to embryonic lethals
and Chl. to chlorophyll mutants, both after natural selfing, M.E.L.
(i.e., maternally conditioned E.L.; see below) is used for embryonic
lethals found after applying control pollen. The rare chlorophyll
mutants found after crossing can be neglected.<p>

It is seen that for each of the three categories (E.L., Chl.  M.E.L.)
the observations can be represented very well by a straight line,
which originates at a point just left of the dose of 5 mM EMS.  It
should be noted that the level of this point coincides with the
control level, i.e., 0% chlorophyll mutants, and 1.5% embryonic
lethals (both, E.L. and M.E.L.).  It can be added that the fertility
after natural selfing (not given in the graph) drops linearly from
precisely the same point left of 5 mM, from a level of 92% (which
equals the control) to 15% at 17.5 mM EMS.  It is attractive to
consider a concentration just below 5 mM as a threshold, under which
no EMS-effect becomes manifest.<p>

MULLER (1966) concludes from his EMS-experiments (treatment with 2.5
mM up to 25.0 mM, 18 hrs (!), 22*degrees*C) that the frequency of
both, embryonic lethals and chlorophyll mutants increases
exponentially (n=+/-2), like a two-hit curve does.  His percentage for
recessive lethals of all types (mc in Exp. 1, Table 3, l.c.) are
inserted into our graph with crosses (x).  For ease of inspection his
concentration scale (mM) was multiplied by 0.6, i.e., his dose of 25
mM is entered at our 15 mM etc.  Except for the three lower doses
(including 0 mM), which are below our "threshold-dose", his results
can be adequately described by the same straight line.  The notion of
an exponential dose-response curve is mainly based on the three lower
doses. This in turn is due to the fact that MULLER's mutant frequency
goes down to virtually 0% (for 0 mM), in contrast to all our
experiments which gave a minimum of 1-2%.  MULLERs statement (p. 217,
l.c.) that at lower doses a larger fraction of the alkylations might
be repaired than at higher doses, seems not altogether irreconcilable
with our concenpt of a "threshold-dose".  Nevertheless, the disturbing
fact remains that GICHNER (1965), who also studied an EMS-dose range
(18 hrs, 24*degrees*C, 6 hrs post-washing), found a dose-response
curve for lethals of all types which is clearly exponential throughout
the range.<p>

A final point regards the non-recessive embryonic lethals (M.E.L.)
found after pollinating with control (C) pollen.  In a previous report
(Van der VEEN, 1967b) the percentages of embryonic lethals after 10 mM
(24 hrs, 24*degrees*C) were 1.1% for the Control, 1.7% for cxEMS, 7.1%
(!) for EMSxC and 19.0% for EMS (natural selfing).  The different
hypotheses proposed for this reciprocal difference have now been
tested. From this M1-material 120 CxEMS-fruits and 120 EMSxC-fruits
were harvested (one fruit per plant).  In each M2-family (from
crossing) 2 plants were left to natural selfing and 2 plants were
pollinated with C-pollen. The embryo-test was again applied on fruits
No. 5 and 6.  The array of genotypes is expected to be the same for
CxEMS and EMSxC, except for those mutations which were subject to
differential selection in male versus female gametes.  Indeed, after
natural selfing CxEMS and EMSxC segregated 7.5 and 5.1% chlorophyll
mutants and 11.2 and 9.1% embryonic lethals respectively. Significant
is that (CxEMS)xC and (EMSxC)xC produced resp. 5.9 and 4.8% embryonic
lethals. The latter quality leads to the conclusion that the
nonrecessive embryonic lethals are mainly caused by maternal
physiolgoical effects (induced by the impaired genotype of the
sporophyte).  The rader can easily verify that the M2-results exclude
substantial contributions of (1) autonomous effects of the embryonic
cytoplasma, (2) gene-dose effects in the triploid endosperm, and (3)
dominant embryonic lethal mutations transmitted by the female gamete
only.<p>
