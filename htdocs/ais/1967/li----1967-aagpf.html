	An abnormal progeny was obtained from X-ray irradiated seeds (50,000 r) of the Columbia wild type.  In the second selfed generation it segregatd into 69 green and 57 yellow-semilethal plants.  The progenies of 20 green sibs were further analyzed.  All repeated the abnormal ratio.  In the subsequent generation 112 normal phenotype plants were further studied; only seven of them did not segregate. The majority of the segregating families was abnormal though some displayed approximately normal ratios.<p>

	Normal phenotype individuals from abnormally segregating families were crossed reciprocally to normal testers with recessive markers.  When the testers were used as males, 46.4% (13/28) of the individuals did not segregate for the yellow-semilethal factor; in the reciprocal crosses the corresponding value was 12.9% (4/31).<p>

	It appears that the abnormal ratio is caused by two factors:  a yellow-semilethal factor and a segregation distorter which were induced in the same cell, and involving homologues of the same chromosome.  In the original cell these two factors were apparently in repulsion.  The yellow-semilethal factor is normally transmitted through both egg and sperm, but the distorter factor is generally not transmitted through the sperm.  Their relative distance can be determined by the segregation ratio and transmission data (HIRONO, 1964)<p>

	In the second selfed generation 57 (45.2%) yellow-semilethal
plants were observed in a population of 126.  If the segregation
distorter is not transmitted through the male, and the female
transmisison is nearly normal as the limtied data indicate, one would
expect 43.6% recessives if the recombination between the distorter and
the yellow semilethal is 12.9%.  (The frequency of nonsegregating
progeny is a measure of recombination between these two factors.)  In
another experiment 112 normal phenotype plants from the abnormal
families were progeny tested; only seven (6.3%) failed to segregate
for the yellow-semilethal factor.  When the double heterozygotes were
outcrossed to female testers, 87.1% (27/31) of the progenies
segregated normally for the yellow-semilethal were in coupling phase.  The difference among 6.3%, 12.9% and 18.5% could probably be due to the size of the small populations studied.<p>

	Crossing over is quite a variable phenomenon.  Exact information on recombination can be obtained in large populations only.  It appears safe to conclude that these two factors are in the same chromosome and the map distance is in between 6 and 18 units.  So far it was not successful to locate these two factors as to the linkage group established in our laboratory.  The markers an, er, gl1, gi2, and co are independent of these two factors.<p>

	Information obtained in our laboratory indicates that gametophyte factors (HIRONO and REDEI, 1965; REDEI, 1965) are frequently produced by mutagens.  The estimation of mutation rate by the use of the mutant frequencies in the second selfed generation after treatment may be loaded with different but definite systematic errors because of the presence of gametophyte factors. The poor male transmission may lead to an over- or underestimate of recessive frequencies in the second selfed generation depending whether the gametphyte factor occurred in repulsion or in coupling with the induced mutant factors.<p>
