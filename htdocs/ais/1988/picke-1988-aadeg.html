ABSTRACT<p>

Fresh and stored trinucleate Arabidopsis thaliana pollen grains
germinated on optimized agar media. The in vitro germination rate was
compared with the results of the Fluorochromatic Reaction Test.
Different conservation conditions for the pollen were tested. About
80% of dried pollen grains stored for 40 weeks at -20*degrees*C still
germinated in vitro. Conserved and rehydrated pollen was able to set
seed on male sterile plants. The lag phase of the pollen takes 10-15
minutes.<p>

INTRODUCTION<p>

In general pollen grains of angiosperms can be classified into two
groups, namely, the binucleate group with a relative easy handling for
germination and conservation, and the trinucleate group which loses
viability very rapidly and can hardly germinate on artificial media.
The taxon cruciferae is the sole trinucleate family in the order
capparidales (Brewbaker, 1967). Mature trinucleate pollen grains
generally contain the twin sperm cells and a vegetative nucleus. The
chromatin of the vegetative nucleus is usually diffuse and often
difficult to stain. Petrov et al. (1984), reported that a
Gallocyano-Chrome Alum staining easily shows clear figures of the
three pollen grain nuclei of Arabidopsis thaliana. The following work
was initiated to determine the longevity of pollen and to develop a
suitable artificial medium for in vitro germination in order to
facilitate studies on pollen conservation for gene bank resources and
for irradiation studies of this species.<p>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<p>

Pollen material: Flowers from plants of A. thaliana race Enkheim
(En-2) cultivated in a greenhouse, were picked. Only flowers during
the B4 phase (Muller, 1961) were used. Pollen grains of this
developmental stage have the highest vitality (Pickert, 1988).<p>

Pollen conservation: Collected pollen grains were put into cryovials
either with or without drying agent (SiO 2)x. Storage conditions: room
temperature + 24*degrees*C, refrigerator +2*degrees*C or freezer
-20*degrees*C. Dried pollen grains were rehydrated in a water
saturated atmosphere at 24*degrees*C for half an hour before
incubation.<p>

In vitro germination tests: The basic media were composed of tap
water, 1% agar, 20% sucrose, 80 ppm boric acid and 10 ppm
myo-inositol. Optimal pGH value was at 5.8 - 6.0 adjusted with HCl.
The heated solution (60*degrees*C) was filled into small petri dishes
(*phi* 34 mm) and cooled down (room temperature). Tap water had better
osmotic qualities than distilled water with added mineral elements.
Instead of liquid media, agar was preferred because the stigma is a
dry type (Hoekstra, 1986).<p>

Pollen germination: The open anthers were dipped carefully under a
sterioscopic microscope into the dishes with media. Thereby the pollen
grains stuck on the surface of the agar media. The closed dishes were
put in a climatic chamber (continuous light, 25*degrees*C, 75%, r.h.)
for at least six hours. After this time the pollen grains with emerged
pollen tubes were counted. Thus pollen tube had to be longer than the
diameter of the grain. Samples of at least 400 pollen grains were
counted for each experiment.<p>

Fluorochromatic Reaction (FCR-Test): Survival of pollen grains can be
indicated by intracellular retention of fluorescein produced by
enzymic hydrolysis of fluoroscein diacetate (Heslop-Harisson and
Heslop-Harisson, 1970). Fluorescein diacetate was dissolved in acetone
(2mg/ml), and dilutions prepared in sucrose solution (2g/10ml H 2O).
Pollen grains were dispersed in a drop of this solution on a
microscope slide and incubated for about 10 min. Observation was
accomplished by a fluorescence microscope (Blue Excifer Filter,
450-490 nm).<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

Comparison of viability test methods: With rehydrated mature pollen of
Arabidopsis thaliana, a good correlation of the results was observed
between in vitro germination and FCR data. For the germination on agar
media the best germination percentage was 80%, for the FCR test 87%.
The results of the staining tests were always higher than those of the
germination tests. This fact may have different causes: The
germination media used was suboptimal - or pollen grains with intact
membranes and functionary enzymes were stained by the FCR, but they
were not able to produce pollen tubes. The FCR-Test is a quick and
reliable method for assessing pollen viability in A. thaliana.<p>

It seems that race En-2 always has 10-15% lethal pollen grains. This
rate depends on the ecotypes and extremely on the culture conditions.
Temperature below 6*degrees*C or above 32*degrees*C, water deficit
during the development of microspores, insecticides or lack of boron
or copper can result in pollen lethality.<p>

Effects of storage: Pollen grains lost their viability entirely after
being stored for two days at 24*degrees*C. When the pollen was
conserved with drying agent at room temperture, 42% of the material
germinated after 2 weeks. Pollen can withstand slow desiccation
without losing viability down to 0.002 mg/l (H 2 0/air, 25*degrees*C).
The germination percentage of stored pollen is shown in Figure 1. An
immense increase of germination percentage during the first days was
observed. This may be traced back to the fact that a sucessful
germination of the pollen grains might require a drying period with
following rehydration. To my experience, prehydration of the A.
thaliana pollen is the most important step before starting germination
on agar media.<p>

Tests with stored and rehydrated pollen showed that this material
still set seeds on male sterile plants (ms-1), comparable to fresh
pollen sample.<p>

The most important environmental factors for successful pollen
conservation are storage temperature and moisture content of the
material; lowering both tends to increase the period of viability. Dry
pollen grains stored at -20*degrees*C for nearly 10 months have a
germination percentage of about 80%.<p>

The easy activation of the metabolic system of trinucleate A. thaliana
pollen before the onset of germination is demonstrated by the short
lag phase which takes only 10-15 minutes. The lag phase is the time
interval between hydration and tube emergence. Hoekstra (1982)
correlated the duration of the lag phase with the level of
mitochondrial development. In general trinucleate pollen gains have
highly or fully organized mitochondria. Pollen tube of A. thaliana
grows in vivo about 1mm per hour (Berger, 1966).<p>

The present study is a first attempt to analyse storage conditions and
viability test methods for A. thaliana pollen. In order to do this,
pollen as a "single celled unit" is a good research tool to elucidate
certain basic patterns (Whithers, 1987).<p>

and advice.<p>
