A postdoctoral position is available immediately in the laboratory of Professor Geoffrey 
Wasteneys at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver 
(http://www.botany.ubc.ca/people/gwasteneys.html). This CIHR-funded position 
provides an opportunity to understand how microtubule dynamics are controlled by the 
highly conserved XMAP215/Dis1/MOR1 class of microtubule-associated proteins. We 
recently demonstrated that the Arabidopsis MOR1 protein increases both the rate of 
growth and shrinkage of cortical microtubules. To understand this further, we are 
investigating the interactions between MOR1’s N-terminal TOG domains and tubulins 
using genetic, biochemical and live cell imaging approaches. The project is supported by 
state-of-the-art instruments and the technical expertise of the UBC Bio-imaging facility. 
The candidate should have recently obtained a PhD and must have experience in 
molecular biology, protein biochemistry that includes protein expression in heterologous 
systems and protein interaction assays. Strong interests in the cytoskeleton and structural 
biology is desirable. Enquires should be made to Geoff Wasteneys via email 
(geoffwas@interchange.ubc.ca).
