<h2>THE OCCURRENCE OF ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA IN THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS</h2><p>

am Main<p>

A group from the Forschungsinstitut Senckenberg, Frankfurt, has been
studying the flora and vegetation of the Cape Verde Islands since
1978. The main purpose of the investigations is to develop a new
phytogeographical division of biogeographic region "Macaronesia".<p>

During recent fieldwork in the Rep. de Capo Verde from 1978 until 1982
a total number of about 2600 dried plant specimens was collected by
the author. Based on actual observations and the collected material, a
new phytogeographical division of the archipelago has been published
(Lobin, 1982). Following this article, the Cape Verde Islands are no
longer part of "Macaronesia" but belong to the saharo-sindian region.<p>

A description of the different islands, their vegetation and their
biotopes can be found by various authors. e.g., Schmidt (1852),
Chevalier (1935), Lobin and Groh (1979, 1980), Lobin 1982) and
Schleich and Wuttke (1983).<p>

Among the collected material there are two samples of Arabidopsis
thaliana, both collected on the islands of Fogo. Schmidt (1852) had
been the first to report this species from the Cape Verdes. He
observed and collected it in Sto. Antao, saying it varies little from
the typical german form by having smaller peduncles, although these
vary considerably among the Cape Verdean population. Chevalier (1935)
in his thorough work did not give a new record and it was Sunding who
made in 1976 the second collection of A. thaliana in the Cape Verdes
(Sunding, 1981). He also found the plants in Sto. Antao. In 1980 I
collected the species in two localities in Fogo and Rustan and
Brochmann reported the species 1982 again from Sto. Antao and Fogo
(Rustan and Brochmann, 1984 in press). A. thaliana which seems to be a
rather rare plant is known from the archipelago for already 130 years.<p>

General Distribution:<p>

The anthochtonous distribution of A. thaliana is uncertain. It seems
most likely that the plant has been introduced into North-America and
Australia. Redei (1970) reports A. thaliana from North America, most
parts from Europe, North Africa (Morocco, Algeria, Tunesia, Libya),
East Africa and South Africa, from Middle- and South-east Asia, Japan
(after Ratcliffe 1976 probably also introduced) and Australia
(Canberra-Region only). The species is known from the Canarian Islands
and Maderia, but not from the Cape Verde Islands (Redei, 1970).<p>

Habitat:<p>

A. thaliana was observed on the Cape Verde Islands by Sunding as well
as Lobin, and Rustan and Brochmann in high altitudes. The plants were
collected at altitudes above 600 m. The majority of the samples were
growing above 1200 m. I observed the plants in a rocky wall where they
were growing in small gaps and ledges covered with moss. In the
archipelago A. thaliana does not grow in fields or similar landscape
forms as they do in Central Europe.<p>

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT<p>

I want to thank the DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) for
sponsoring our project.<p>
