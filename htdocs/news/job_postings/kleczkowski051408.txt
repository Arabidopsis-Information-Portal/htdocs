A Ph.D. student position is currently available in my laboratory at
the Department of Plant Physiology, Umea Plant Science Centre, Umea
University, Sweden. The position will generally be focused on
regulation of gene expression and protein activities involved in
carbohydrate metabolism in plants. Specific focus will be on
posttranscriptional (e.g. gene splicing) and posttranslational
regulation (e.g. phosphorylation) (see Plant Physiology 134: 912-918,
2004; Gene 389: 186-195, 2007). Other part will concern identification
and verification of cis regulatory elements (CREs) responsible for
sugar signaling in Arabidopsis, using synthetic promoters based on
specific CREs (see Plant Journal 45: 384-398, 2006).

The successful candidate must be highly motivated and have a Master’s
degree, or equivalent, and have a strong background in molecular and
cell biology or related fields. The application should include a
letter of interest, a curriculum vitae, and names and e-mail addresses
of two references familiar with the candidate´s qualifications. For
