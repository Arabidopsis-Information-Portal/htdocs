Postdoctoral Research Associate 
Ref: 00109-1 
Salary: £31,513 - £35,469 per annum (grade 7). 
 
Applications are invited for a Research Associate position to join a team studying organ specificity 
in the Arabidopsis circadian clock (see James et al. (2008) Science 322, 1832). The main aim is 
to understand protein function underlying plasticity of the clock. The work will include analysis of 
gene expression using qPCR, microarrays and promoter:reporter fusions, assessment of 
protein:DNA interactions and studies of protein modification and complex formation in vivo. 
Previous experience in molecular/cellular biology or biochemistry is essential, not necessarily in 
plants. The position is supported by a BBSRC grant to Prof. Hugh Nimmo, to whom informal 
enquiries can be made by email to h.g.nimmo@bio.gla.ac.uk. 
 
You should be available to start in the near future. More experienced individuals are encouraged 
to apply. The University of Glasgow is committed to skills training and provides a wide variety of 
courses and opportunities to advance your career. Funding for this post is available for three 
years.
