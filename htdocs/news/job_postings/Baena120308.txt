One post-doctoral position is available in the 
Plant Stress Signaling 
group at the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência 
located near Lisbon, 
Portugal (http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt). 
Starting date February 1st 
2009. 
 
Research in the lab focuses on energy 
signaling and its connection to 
environmental changes and growth. The 
Arabidopsis KIN10 and KIN11 
protein kinases play a central role during the 
stress response and are 
required for the proper integration of 
environmental cues into growth 
and development. In order to further dissect 
and understand the 
KIN10/11-mediated signaling cascade, the 
post-doc will work in one of 
the following topics: 
 
1)      Regulatory mechanisms underlying 
KIN10/11 action, in particular 
post-translational modification and 
subcellular localization 
2)      Identification of upstream and 
downstream components by functional 
genomics and yeast-two-hybrid approaches 
3)      Identification of novel components of 
the signaling cascade using a 
genetic screen of luciferase reporter plants 
 
Applicants should have a PhD in genetics, 
biochemistry or molecular 
biology, with excellent communication skills 
and a strong background 
in molecular biology and plant physiology. 
Experience in yeast-two- 
hybrid technology or plant genetics and 
mapping is a plus. Interested 
candidates should send CV, brief description 
of previous research, and 
contact information of 3 references to 
ebaena@igc.gulbenkian.pt.
