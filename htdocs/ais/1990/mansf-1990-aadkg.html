SUMMARY<p>

The free-nuclear division of the endosperm is initiated prior to the
first zygotic division forming between 4 and 8 nuclei, two of which
migrate to opposite poles of the embryo-sac. The second division
series is synchronous but thereafter asynchronous. Nuclei accumulate
on the embryosac periphery. The early endosperm cytoplasm is similar
to that of the central cell but starch reserves and small vacuoles,
observed prior to fertilization, are absent. Throughout development
ribosome density and plastid and mitochondrial volume densities are
high. The endosperm is of the helobial type, characterized by two
structurally different regions of tissue; the chalazal endosperm
contains numerous active dictyosomes, abundant rough ER and is
extremely vacuolate. Also free-nuclear divisions in the micropylar
region are prolific, whereas the chalazal endosperm undergoes a
limited number of divisions.<p>

INTRODUCTION<p>

Despite the developmental significance of endosperm for embryogenesis
(RAGHAVAN, 1976), qualitative anatomical and ultrastructural accounts
of in situ endosperm ontogeny are few and there are certainly none at
all covering the quantitative aspects of endosperm development.<p>

A light microscope account of limited detail describing endosperm
formation in Arabidopsis thaliana has been published by MARSDEN and
MEINKE (1985) but the subcellular changes of the coenocytic endosperm
in this species has not been studied. Detailed accounts have been
published for other crucifers including Draba verna and Sisymbrium
thalianum (VANDENDRIES, 1909), Alyssum maritimum (PRABHAKAR, 1979) and
Capsella bursa-pastoris (SCHULZ and JENSEN, 1974). In the latter two
species, the endosperm 'cells' undergo significant changes in
organelle structure, abundance and distribution during development,
and significant subcellular differences occur between the chalazal and
micropylar regions of tissue. Also from the work of MARSDEN and MEINKE
(1985) it is apparent that the anatomical changes that occur in
Arabidopsis are somewhat similar to Alyssum and Capsella and this may
also be the case at the ultrastructural level.<p>

This report involves a description of the free-nuclear endosperm in
Arabidopsis during early embryo growth and forms part of a detailed
study of embryogenesis in this species (MANSFIELD, 1989) relating
development to a defined time scale in hours after flowering (HAF)
(using the visual definition of flowering previously defined by
MUELLER, 1961) and intended to form a baseline for further
investigations.<p>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<p>

Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana (erecta mutant, Landsberg ecotype; MAHER
and MARTINDALE, 1980) were grown in a 1:1 mixture of John Innes
soilless EFF and John Innes no. 3 composts under controlled conditions
in a Fisons growth cabinet 600H. The plants were grown singly in
batches of 40 40 mm square pots in continuous "warm white" fluorescent
and tungsten lighting (7000 lumen m -2) at a temperature of 25 +/-
1*degrees*C. Relative humidity was kept constant at 70% and the plants
watered twice weekly with distilled water.<p>

Material for light microscopy (LM) was fixed in 3% v/v glutaraldehyde
in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 at ambient temperature for 2.5
h. After rinsing in the same buffer (4 x 20 min) the material was
dehydrated in an ethanol series to 95% at 0*degrees*C, preinfiltrated
with a 1:1 mixture of ethanol and LKB Historesin for 48 h at
4*degrees*C and embedded in LKB Histomoulds using fresh pure resin.
Thick sections from Historesin blocks (3 - 4 *micro*m) were stained
with periodic acid and Schiff's reagent (PAS staining) followed by
counterstaining with toluidine blue.<p>

Material for transmission electron microscopy was fixed and washed as
described for LM, followed by postfixation in 1% v/v OsO 4 in the same
buffer for 2 h at ambient temperature and then carried through a
standard alcohol dehydration and epoxy resin embedding.<p>

Measurements of areal fractions (and hence volume fractions) were
carried out by point-counting (using a point spacing equivalent to the
diameter of a mitochondrion, 8.0 mm) on photographic enlargements (16
- 30,000x) and used to estimate the volume density of organelles in
the endosperm cells.<p>

RESULTS<p>

After fertilization in the embryosac the primary endosperm nucleus
divides (approximately two to four HAF) to form two daughter nuclei
(Figure 1) which then undergo a further one or two division cycles
prior to the first zygotic division producing between four (Figure 2)
and eight nuclei; in the former case, two on the longitudinal walls of
the embryosac (Figure 3), a single nucleus that migrates to the
chalazal region and a fourth which divides around the micropylar
region surrounding the embryo. In the nuclei that migrate to the
extreme chalazal and micropylar poles, division is temporarily
arrested but their associated cytoplasm proliferates. Figure 4 shows
the micropylar nucleus and associated cytoplasm adjacent to the zygote
base. The second division series is synchronous, but later, with rapid
enlargement of the endosperm, divisions become asynchronous.<p>

Micropylar region<p>

A large central vacuole occupies the major portion of the curved
embryosac between the endosperm nuclei and there is also a thin
peripheral layer of endosperm lining the whole embryosac and
connecting each of the nuclei. The early endosperm cytoplasm is very
similar to the central cell cytoplasm in many respects i.e. a high
volume density of spherical to oval chloroplasts and mitochondria,
high ribosome density and abundant ER (Figure 5) (Table 1). However,
after the division of the primary endosperm nucleus, the small
vacuoles present in the nuclear-associated cytoplasm of the central
cell disappear, as do the large starch bodies of the plastids. Nuclei
are irregular in profile and possess no micronuclei or perinuclear
deposits.<p>

The quadrant embryo endosperm (24 HAF) consists of several nuclei on
the embryo-sac wall (Figure 6; serial sectioning showed the presence
of 14 nuclei), the cytoplasm of which appears structurally different
compared to earlier stages. Although the plasmalemma has a smooth
profile, small vacuoles develop throughout the cytoplasm but mainly
adjacent to the integument cell wall (Figure 7) and plastids are
elongated and larger than previously. Rough ER is the predominant form
of ER and ribosome density remains very high (Table 1). Small
embryosac wall projections develop in the endosperm cytoplasm at this
stage (not shown).<p>

By the late-globular stage of embryo development (60 HAF) the
free-nuclear endosperm attains maximum development with the completion
of nuclear divisions prior to cellularization. The endosperm tissue
extends around the whole embryosac periphery (Figure 8). Thus, prior
to cellularization the suspensor and most of the embryo-proper is
submerged in endosperm tissue (Figure 8). The endosperm 'cells'
increase in volume throughout development reaching maximum size during
this period (Table 2) but nuclear diameter remains constant. The
surface area of endosperm tissue to the embryosac wall is reduced by
means of pulling away of the plasmalemma (Figure 9). Plastid volume
density increases considerably (Table 1) and their form is highly
variable, appearing spherical, oval or lobed, and grana spacing and
orientiation changes (Figure 10). Small osmiophilic granules and lipid
globules are observed in the stroma (Figure 10). In contrast the
plastidome of the adjacent embryo cells is relatively undifferentiated
(not shown). Throughout endosperm formation, the volume density of
mitochondria remains high (Table 1) but the variation in their size
and shape increases.<p>

Immediately prior to cellularization there is a distinct increase in
the number of osmiophilic granules and lipid globules in plastids, and
cytoplasmic lipid is deposited in small bodies (_ 0.5 *micro*m - not
shown). Dictyosome number and activity also incrase, but compared to
earlier stages cytoplasmic organization decreases (not shown).<p>

Chalazal region<p>

The endosperm nucleus that migrates to the chalazal pole (Figure 2)
remains undivided for approximately 18 - 24h, although its cytoplasm
continues to proliferate, increasing in volume. As the embryo reaches
the quadrant embryo stage (24 HAF) and the micropylar endosperm
consists of several peripherally situated nuclei the chalazal nucleus
divides forming a binucleate mass of tissue (Figure 11).<p>

Initially the cytoplasm appears similar to the micropylar endosperm
but following the first zygotic division the structure of the chalazal
endosperm is modified, such that by the mid-globular embryo stage the
cytoplasm is remarkably different. Present by this stage are numerous
mitochondria, dictyosomes active in vesicle production, an abundance
of rough ER; cisternae are arranged in parallel stacks, and many
irregular vacuoles of variable size (Figure 12). Plastid size has
increased considerably (Table 2) with a concomitant increase in volume
density (Table 1). Embryosac wall projections develop in the cytoplasm
at approximately 60 HAF (mid-globular embryo) adjacent to the
degenerated antipodals and nucellus (Figure 12) and these structures
become more extensive with time. Many mitochondria, dictyosomes and
rough ER are associated with these growths (Figure 12).<p>

By the heart embryo stage (72 HAF) the chalazal endosperm consists of
between eight and 12 prominent nuclei. The most noticeable changes
include an increase in endosperm volume and plastid volume density
(Table 1). The latter organelles show a rather unusual distribution,
being positioned around each nucleus (Figure 13). The whole tissue is
extremely vacuolate, as the number of vacuoles increases but their
size decreases.<p>

The maturation period of the chalazal endosperm (72 - 108 HAF) is
characterized by a significant increase in rough ER, dictyosome
(Figure 14) and in a few ovules the occurrence of unusual crystal-like
inclusions (Figure 15). Ribosome density and plastid and mitochondrial
volume density all decrease slightly (Table 1).<p>

DISCUSSION<p>

The migration of the two daughter nuclei, formed by the division of
the primary endosperm nucleus, to opposite poles of the embryosac has
been described for the crucifers Capsella (SCHULZ and JENSEN, 1974),
Draba and Sisymbrium (VANDENDRIES, 1909). Also, as reported in this
study for Arabidopsis and previously by MARSDEN and MEINKE (1985), the
numerous endosperm nuclei formed in later embryo development always
accumulate on the embryosac periphery; a feature characteristic of
Capsella (SCHULZ and JENSEN), 1974), Cardamine pratensis and Draba
(VANDENDRIES, 1909).<p>

The structure of the endosperm in Arabidopsis is such that it could be
defined as helobial, having two structurally different regions of
endosperm, the micropylar and chalazal chambers. The latter tissue is
highly vacuolate, contains numerous active dictyosomes and abundant
rough ER arranged in parallel stacks, and free-nuclear divisions in
the micropylar region are prolific whereas the chalazally-growing
endosperm undergoes a limited number of nuclear divisions producing 10
to 15 nuclei. Additionally, cellularization is delayed considerably in
the chalazal chamber (MANSFIELD, 1989). This is similar to that
observed in Haemanthus katherinae (NEWCOMB, 1978) where the endosperm
has been characterized as being helobial.<p>

From the observations made with Arabidopsis in this study and Capsella
(SCHULZ and JENSEN, 1974) it seems reasonable to conclude that the
developmental variations occurring in the micropylar and chalazal
endosperm are induced by environmental differences existing in these
two regions of the embryosac. Perhaps the development of the
micropylar endosperm is influenced by the proximity of the embryo and
suspensor and the chalazal endosperm is influenced by the adjacent
chalazal proliferating tissue, degenerated antipodals and nucellus.
The induction of specific patterns of of differentiation in one tissue
by the presence of another closely-associated tissue is well known and
has been extensively studied in animal systems (GROBSTEIN, 1956).<p>

The distribution and differentiation of organelles is a significant
feature in the endosperm of Arabidopsis throughout early embryo
development. For example, plastids continuously increased in size and
volume density. A similar pattern of development has been observed in
Capsella (SCHULZ and JENSEN, 1974) and Alyssum (PRABHAKAR, 1979) and
it may be that differentiation of the plastidome is related to
nutrition of the embryo, since in Arabidopsis the switch to
autotrophic growth by the embryo (which may be inferred by the
presence of numerous starch-containing chloroplasts) does not occur to
much later stages of development (heart-shaped -MANSFIELD, 1989).<p>

Also of interest is the sharp decline of starch reserves in the
central cell during the first few divisions of the primary endosperm
nucleus. This suggests that these metabolites are mobilized to support
the initial burst of endosperm growth following fertilization.<p>

The endosperm in Arabidopsis may have a morphogenetic role. The
intense metabolic activity of the young endosperm, indicated by the
abundance of plastids, ER and mitochondria, may in part reflect the
production of growth factors or other substances. Although this theory
is rather speculative it is known that many different classes of
hormones are present in the nuclear endosperm of leguminous plants
(EEUWENS and SCHWABE, 1975; GILLARD and WATSON, 1976). Also in
Capsella growth substances are known to influence the early growth and
morphogenesis of embryos in vitro (RAGHAVAN and TORREY, 1963) and
studies with Arabidopsis (HUANG and YEOMAN, 1983, 1984) have shown
that the synthetic auxin 2,4 D plays an essential role in inducing
embryogenic callus).<p>

Embryosac wall projections develop in the micropylar and chalazal
free-nuclear endosperm of Arabidopsis. In the chalazal region this
probably serves to increase the absorption of nutrients from the
degenerated antipodal and nucellar cells, whereas those of the
micropylar endosperm allow for a greater influx from the integuments.
The latter situation is analogous to that described for Capsella
(SCHULZ and JENSEN, 1974) whereby integumental cells opposite the
embryosac wall projections in endosperm 'cells' gradually lose their
starch reserves, atrophy, and become fillled with tannins.<p>

In Arabidopsis small vacuoles form in the micropylar endosperm of the
quadrant embryo adjacent to the embryosac wall and a similar pattern
of vacuole development has been described for Capsella (SCHULZ and
JENSEN, 1974), but in both regions of the endosperm. This atypical
distribution of vacuoles may represent preliminary stages in the
spatial organization of the cytoplasm prior to endosperm
cellularization.<p>
