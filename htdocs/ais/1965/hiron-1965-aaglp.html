Vol 01S: <h2>Concurrent Products of Premeiotic Recombination</h2><p>

Y. HIRONO and G. P. REDEI<p>

Arabidopsis is the first higher plant in which premiotic exchange of
linked markers has been reported (HIRONO and REDEI, 1963, 1965).
Drosophila is the only other higher organism where non-meiotic
crossing over has been demonstrated (cf. WESTERGARD, 1964). In human
leukocytes there is only cytological evidence for spontaneous
chromatid exchange (GERMAN, 1964) and for mitomycin C induced
chiasmata (SHAW and COHEN, 1965)<p>

Genetic analysis of somatic cells is virtually impossible since
critical progeny tests are limited to the "germ line", in higher
plants if the differentiation of the "soma" is reversible an adequate
analysis of the mechanism may become feasible. Interpretation of the
causes of somatic sectoring requires extreme caution. The term mitotic
crossing over should be used only if the recombination yielding exact
complementary products of exchange is achieved by parameiosis (HURST
and FOGEL, 1964) i.e., meiotic type synapsis and mitotic centromere
disjunction. Unfortunately these criteria have not yet been
ascertained in any organism including the lower plants, extensively
studied.  Premeiotic or nonmeiotic exchange appears to be a better
term for the cases where interstrand reassortment of linked markers
prior to meiosis can be demonstrated, but the exact mechanism
responsible for the exchange is not identified. Since the mechanism of
meiotic crossing over is not understood (cf. WESTERGAASRD, 1964; UHL,
1965), equating two unknowns does not contribute to any knowledge.<p>

Somatic recombination may be useful as a general term to denote
sectoring. The term somatic crossing over has only historical value
since strictly somatic cells generally can not be subjected to a test
which may distinguish between the several mechnisms causing somatic
recombination.<p>

A previous study in Arabidopsis (HIRONO and REDEI, 1963, 1965)
demonstrated premeiotic recombination in a single case by the analysis
of the half product of the exchange. Recently indications were found
of the appearance of double products of the exchange. Also additional
cases of non meiotic recombination of linked markers will be reported
below.<p>

Again, recombination was induced by x-irradiation of triple
hetrozygotes (cf. HIRONO and REDEI, 1965). Seed was harvested of each
plant which displayed yellow (ch) sectors. Each seed sample was
individually analysed by progeny test to determine genotypic
frequencies.<p>

From about 2,000 seedlings of appropriate genotype, approximately 200
displayed yellow green (ch) sectors. A much smaller number of plants
exchibited spots which were only tentatively identified as pa (darker
green than normal). Twin spots were observed occasionally. In 13 cases
seed bearing shoots developed from the yellow green sectors. Two cases
appeared to be a deficiency of the ch+ allele. Because of the small
size of the shoot sectors or because of the low fertility (possibly
due to the immediate effect of the iradiation) seven plants failed to
yield enough seed to clarify the mechanism underlying the sector
formation.  None of the sectors appeared to be due to nondisjunction
since the yellow green progeny segretated for two markers. Either
deletion or mutation, or marker exchange may be responsible for these
seven cases.  Data from four plants indicated, however that marker
exchange between homologous chromatids caused the appearance of the
yellow sectors (Table 1). The yellow sector of plants No. 1 was
apparently chimeric. A small strip of tissue of the original genetic
constitution was apparently hidden in the lower cell layers and gained
expression in the few plants of non-ch phenotype. The progeny of the
other twelve yellow stem sectors did not contain non-ch plants. All
single reciprocal chromatic exchanges between the centromere and the
ch locus may give rise to twin spots. In the absence of developmental
selection, a double exchange between the centromere and ch and ch and
pa, respectively, can produce single yellow sectors. Single pa spots
may be expected if the exchange takes place bewetween ch and pa loci.
The map of this particular chromosome arm is as follows:<p>

According to the relative position of the markers, single ch spots are
expected the least frequently but were found most commonly.  Single pa
sectors are expected to occur rarely. The frequency of any type of pa
spots was low. so far only one pa shoot sector has been identified by
phenotype.<p>

A study of the progeny of certain small green shoots adjacent to
yellow sectors indicated clearly an excess of pa plants (Table 1,
Plant No.'s 1, 1111-63, 1224-1). These shoots appeared non-pa in
phenotype. An analysis of the second generation of the wild phenotype
plants obtained from the green sector of plant No. 1 revealed an
anomaly similar to that found in the immediate progeny of the sector.
The observation led first to the tentative conclusion that the product
complementary to the yellow sector was not included in the green spot
(HIRONO and REDAI, 1965). Such an anomalous sector might be due to a
cell of the original genetic constitution with one strand (gi2 ch1)
coincidentally severed by the iradiation.<p>

In the progeny of three green branches of plant No. 1111-63 2 which
originally had a different constitution, an excess of gi2 pa
phenotypes is obvious (Table 1). A similar segregation is apparent in
the progeny of a green branch of plant No. 1224-1. A comparable
situation is indicated by the analysis of the green part adjacent to
the yellow stem of plant No. 1100-6 which contained only the gi2 and
ch1 markers. Here again the gi2 class is larger than expected (Table
1).<p>

In all four of these plants the segregation of the progenies of both
yellow and some green sectors is anomalous. All four yellow sector
progenies segregate in a fashion indicative of some kind of chromatid
exchange. It appears as if the chromatid damage occurred prior to or
during the exchange. It is also striking that in all cases, certain
strands from some adjacent green sectors display poor transmission.<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol01S/vol01S-pg87-tab1.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

From 2000 irradiated heterozygotes four plants were obtained which
permitted a reasonably good progeny test of the yellow and some green
sectors. This is a frequency of 2 x 10-3. Other studies show that
after the type of irradiation used in these experiments, segregation
distorting factors (chromosome damage acting as such) affecting the
transmission of specific genes do not appear more frequently than 10-2
or -3. In this material such segregation distorters appeared in both
the yellow green (ch) sector progenies and in the offspring of
adjacent non- ch branches. The maximal estimate for the triple
coincidence is therefore 2 x 10-3 x 10-2 x 10-2 = 2 x 10-7. Similarly
the coincidence of a yellow sector and an adjacent anomalous green
sector is not expected to be more frequent than 2 x 10-7. Similarly
the coincidence of a yellow sector and an adjacent anomalous green
sector is not expected to be more frequent than 2 x 10-5. The
probablility for finding four ch sectors accompanied by abnormally
segregation green parts is (10-2)4.  This simple logic indicates that
the phenomenon characterized by Table 1 is not due to independent
events.<p>

Data of plant No. 1224-1 are also of special interest for another
reason. In the yellow green sector a chromosome defect is carried by
the non-exchange strand. The recombined strand appears normal. This
new information provides direct proof that the yellow sector did not
originate through a deletion of the ch+ allele and a simultaneous
deficiency at the pa region.<p>

The reality of premeiotic marker exchange is well demonstrated by the
few cases which offered a chance for critical tests. In the vicinity
of the yellow sectors, green sectors apparently complementary to the
former were found. Coincidence of the two sectors is ruled out on
statistical grounds. The exact mechanism of the exchange is not well
understood, however. Reciprocal chromatid translocation has been
suggested as a plausible cause of this type of somatic recombination
(HIRONO and REDEI, 1965). It is well to remember that there are
several unsolved basic problems in the interpetation of the mechanism
of meiotic crossing over. It is not known whether non-allelic and
allelic recombination share a common mechanism. Much less is known
about the machinery of mitotic exchange (cf. WESTERGAARD, 1964).
Somatic recombination in Drosphila was discovered about thirty years
ago (STERN, 1936) and a few observations which are at variance with
the crossing over interpretation still await reconciliation with the
commonly accepted view (PONTECORVO, 1958; PRITCHARD, 1963) that
meiotic crossing over and mitotic recombination are brought about by
essentially the same mechanism. Meiotic crossing over does not take
place regularly in the male Drosphila MORGAN, 1912), but ciasmata have
been observed in the spermatocytes (COOPER, 1949). Somatic
recombination is not uncommon, however, in the male Drosphila (STERN,
1936). Factors known to suppress crossing over in meiosis are inactive
in somatic recombination (LeCLERC, 1946). Chromosomal rearrangements
do not interfere seriously with somatic recombination in the regions
concerned (WALEN, 1964). The frequency of single and double exchange
apparently deviate from expectation based on meiotic map distance
(ABBADESSA and BURDICK, 1963).  The critical progeny test is not yet
feasible on the products of mitotic exchange in any other organism
where mitosis and meiosis are amenable to appropriate cytolitical
studies.<p>

Discussion:<p>

FEENSTRA: Did you ever observe recombination in this system without
irradiation?<p>

REDEI: No. Spontaneously this does not occur. This is one reason, we
think, the mechanism is not crossing over. This is some other type of
exchange.<p>

FEENSTRA: Would it be feasible to combine one of the defect
chromosomes with the normal in an F1 without irradiation?<p>

REDEI: Yes. The segment changed could have lost one factor which
controlled synapsis regularly in mitosis and when this factor was
lost, synapsis might take place in mitosis. But this is not the case
because somatic segregation does not occur again spontaneously in the
tissues of the progeny of these plants.<p>

VELEMINSKY: Did you find some dependence on the dosis of irradiation?<p>

REDEI: We used only 10 and 12 kr on 24 hr presoaked seed or 50-60 kr
on dry seed.<p>

JACOBS: Do you think that chemicals will be useful in such
experiments?<p>

REDEI: I believe EMS which produces an enormous number of chromosomal
alterations may do the same as X-rays. The reason we do not use EMS
is, that this induces many light-green and white sectors also in
homozygous material. In a few cases we got seeds from these stem
sectors, but the sterility was higher than in the X-irradiated
progeny.  In the X-rayed material generally we do not get other types
of yellow sectors, only that we expected from the genetic
constitution.<p>

ROBBELEN: This might be dependent on treatment conditions of
chemicals, too. The sterility and even the number of sectors can be
very much decreased by appropriate treatment conditions.<p>

REDEI: Probably, by low doses.<p>

ROBBELEN: The interesting fact in chemicals may be, that one could get
more insight into the process; there may be some chemicals which do
more to interfere with DNA synthesis, while radiation interferes more
with chromosome structure.<p>

REDEI: I really do not know. There are data in fungi from HOLLIDAY,
who used various kinds of treatments. In one of the last papers he
reported on mitomycin C as a specific DNA inhibitor and that increased
considerably mitotic recombination in Ustilago. We unfortunately need
some more drastic mutagens; Arabidopsis did not respond to mitomycin,
as expected.<p>

VELEMINSKY: Do you think, that the observation of ROSS, who got some
twins after irradiation of tomatoes, could be based on a similar
background?<p>

REDEI: I do not know. That has not been analysed in the same way as
this case by Dr. HIRONO. Progeny tests will be needed before direct
comparison can be made. Indeed, Dr. HIRONO's work is, I think, the
first one in higher plants, where the recombination was demonstrated
by progeny analysis.<p>

REINHOLZ: Did you try some cytogenetical experiments? Is it possible
to see in the nucleus of these cells any chromosomal recombination or
something which looks like chiasmata, or are the chromosomes too
small?<p>

REDEI: Actually we can not detect chiasmata in the mitotic cells.
Arabidopsis cytology is not so good. Dr. Lotti SEARS analysed petal
tissues where mitosis can be easily seen, and very frequently in these
cells she found only 5 chromosomes instead of 10, which was apparently
an indication that they were paired in mitosis. But the frequency of
this was not very high. There is no direct cytological evidence for
the exchange in mitotic cells of Arabidopsis. Direct evidence for
chromatid exchange in recombination, even in meiotic cells was rarely
obtained in a way comparable to the classic papers of STERN and
CREIGHTON and McCLINTOCK.<p>
