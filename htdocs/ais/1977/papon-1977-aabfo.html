Fluctuation peculiarities of the number of Arabidopsis plants are of
certain interest for ecologists, population-biologists, and
genecologists working mainly with zoological subjects. S.S.
Chetverikov (1905) pointed out that populations always undergo
quantitative fluctuation of the number of species of those
populations.  He called this phenomenon "waves of life".<p>

Arabidopsis grows in natural phytocoenosis, near forests and foot
paths, roads, and also in agrophytocoenosis with cultural plants.
Since the distribution after reproduction is restricted to small
centres it becomes possible to count the number of the plants in
invariable districts and to analyse the feature of the plants not
hurting it.  The aim of this contribution is to study data concerning
the change of the plant number in 3 populations located in a distance
of 30 to 40 km from each other.<p>

Populations M and E occupy districts along the edge of coniferous
forests. Geobotanic description in those districts makes it possible
to classify them as variegated grass meadow with weedy and forest
species.  Population E grows in greater darkening than population M.
The third population (B) is located at the side of a road, in the
non-ploughed belt of a field plot joining leaf-bearing forests.
Annually, beginning in early spring of 1968, we counted the total
number of the plants, when the plants were in the phase of flowering
and forming seeds.<p>

Figure 1: Dynamics of the plant numbers in natural populations of
Arabidopsis thaliana<p>

In Figure 1 results of observations are presented which point out the
fluctuation of the plant numbers over a period of 9 years.  In
population B the greatest number of plants was marked in 1968, when
the plants were fixed in the outlying districts of the field plot.
Another character of the plant numbers is shown by population E.
Increase of the number occurred in 1971, 1974, 1976.  In 1970, 1972,
1973, and 1975 the number of plants was minimum. The greatest change
in the number was observed in population M. The highest number of
plants was in 1974, while in 1972 there were no plants at all in early
spring.<p>

We estimated the role of weather.  Graphs of daily precipitation and
mean daily temperature were made.  Analysis of the results showed that
optimum conditions for populations M and E were in years with great
amount of precipitation accompanied by the increase of temperature.
In years of lower numbers of plants (1972, and 1975) values of the
hydrothermal coefficient in the area of populations were the smallest
in comparison with the other years.<p>

The study of seed germination in the laboratory showed that
populations differ in this indicator since decrease of the plant
numbers of populations M in 1969 correlate with low germination of
seeds (Paponova, Chermyanina, 1971) and with the break down of the
pollen regime.<p>

In years of increasing plant numbers the race structure of populations
changes; among others ephemeral forms passing the winter season are
also found in the population.<p>

Obviously, the observed fluctuations of the plant numbers may be
regarded as "waves of life"; the character of manifestation of which
is specific for each population.  In the cases examined above there is
an asynchronism of manifestation of "waves of life" that may be
regarded as one of the adaptive mechanisms in the process of
evolution.<p>
