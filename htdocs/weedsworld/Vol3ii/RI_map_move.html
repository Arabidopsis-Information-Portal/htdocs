<H1>Lister and Dean RI map database and mapping service moves to NASC</H1>

<hr>

On the 19th July, Clare Lister (John Innes Centre, Norwich, UK) formally
handed over the recombinant inbred (RI) map database for the Lister
and Dean RI lines, which she has developed
over the last four years, to the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC).
NASC will now maintain the database, display regular updates to the RI map
and continue to offer a mapping service to the community. <BR>
<BR>
Anyone can send in their mapping data to NASC for mapping. The positions
of all markers mapped by NASC will be made publically available through
the NASC WWW server. The mapping data will be run once a week and the main
map updated once a month.<BR>
<BR>
The segregation data for the <A HREF="67_loci.html">67 loci</A> described in Lister and Dean
(1993) is available at NASC and through <A HREF="/" target="_top">TAIR</A> but the central database
will not be distributed. The aim is to produce one large integrated map
rather than many non-integrated ones. <BR>
<BR>
Please note that NASC can supply information about the probes on request.
 However, NASC does not distribute any of the markers. DNA markers must
be obtained from either the <A HREF="http://aims.cps.msu.edu/aims" target="_top">Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center</A> (ABRC) or from the investigators themselves. Stocks of the RI lines are
available from <A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/" target="_top">NASC</A> and <A HREF="http://aims.cps.msu.edu/aims" target="_top">ABRC</A>.<BR>
<BR>
As promised at the 7th International Arabidopsis meeting at Norwich, Clare
has made one last version of the map. This is available as a text file, as individual postscript files for printing, or as graphics from our <a href="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/ftp/pub/RI_data/._A" target="_top">FTP site</a>. The latest map carries 592 markers.<BR>
<BR>
<H4>How to submit data to NASC.</H4>
RI mapping is conducted using Mapmaker (Lander <I>et al</I> 1987) and so the data
has to conform to the Mapmaker format. We have designed a <A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/RI_submit.html" target="_top">special form</A>
for data submission to help you send in the data in the correct format. Although the form is only currently supported by Netscape version 3.0, we are working on a version complient with all forms-capable browsers.
We recommend that you use this form for data submission and that you fill
in the information for each line. It has been designed to allow us to automatically
enter your data and so circumvents any potential problems with typing errors.
<BR>
<BR>
However, we can also receive data by email to <a href="mailto:arabidopsis@nottingham.ac.uk">arabidopsis@nottingham.ac.uk</a>.
Label your message RIDATA. If sending your information by email please adhere
strictly to the following format, indicating the numbers of the RI lines
used and including the data in (RI) numerical order. <BR>
<BR>
Enter your scores for the RI lines data into a Text file (eg. MacExcel,
or another text file) as follows:-<BR>
A = like Columbia parent<BR>
B = like Landsberg parent<BR>
H = heterozygote (if possible to score)<BR>
- = unscorable or no score<BR>
<BR>
Marker names should start with a * followed by a letter (small or capital)
ie. *w23 and should have a single space or tab between each entry. Names
MUST BE LESS than EIGHT characters. Mapmaker, the programme we use for mapping,
is not case sensitive and so reads &quot;a&quot; and &quot;A&quot; as the
same thing. Please check the current names used for Loci, so as not to generate
conflicts. 
<p>
Your file should look like this:
<pre>
RI line Number		4	5	13	14	17	25	29<br>
*A1			A	A	B	-	A	B	B<br>
*b2			B	B	B	A	H	-	B<br>
*C4			B	A	-	A	B	B	A<br>
</pre>

Save as TEXT ONLY. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For information on how to map your own data using Mapmaker, please refer to the brief description carried in the <a href="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/complete_dean_ri/how_to_map.html" target="_top">NASC on-line catalogue</a>.<BR>
