For many purposes it is desirable to reduce nongenetical variation to
a minimum. Two phases are important: a) synchronizing germination, for
which a trace of KNO3 is known to be a powerful means, and b)
unhampered seedling growth after transplanting etiolated seedlings
with agar blocks.<p>

Though the influence of many factors is widely known, I list my
procedure step by step.  It has been arrived at either by trial and
error, or by systematic variation of factors. This was done partly in
collaboration with my colleague, Dr. W. J. FEENSTRA.<p>

I should be noted that the factor-dosage given below is based on
"safety first" and "for all cases" considerations: e.g., a shorter
cold-treatment may be sufficient for breaking dormancy (depending on
variety, age of seeds, etc.).  One should, however, be also aware that
100% germination does not necessarily imply simultaneous germination.<p>

a)  Synchronizing germination<p>

1.  After-ripening up to 3 weeks in the dark at 32*degrees*C.  depends
on variety, maternal and external ripening conditions, stage of seeds
at harvest, etc.  Seeds left one day more on mother-plant, I
occasionally found to require less storage time.  Of course, one is
anxious not to lose seeds from crossing by splitting open of fruits. A
non-splitting mutant would be welcome, also for large quantity harvest
per plant. After-ripening is still the weakpoint in the procedure and
suggestions would be helpful.<p>

2.  Seeds are laid out on a 4 mm layer of agar (see below): 0,75%
Oxoid No. 3 in tapwater with 100 mg/1 KNO3 (the roots do not
penetrate).  To break seed dormancy, the petridishes are put in
refrigerator (dark 2- 4*degrees*C) for 5 days.  N.B.: If seeds have to
be dried for mutagen treatment, prior cold treatment is on water
saturated filterpaper in petridishes, and afterwards seeds are put on
agar as above and transferred to light (a3).<p>

3.  Transfer to light, e.g., 300W/m2 at 50 cm.  Temperature within (!)
dishes 24*degrees*C.<p>

Any neglect of the factors after ripening cold treatment light + KNO3,
may increase range of germination (first seeds to last seeds) up to
several days.<p>

After 24 hrs under light, germination is not yet visible.  At this
moment the seeds are well synchronized to enter vernalization
treatment (cf. NAPP-ZINN's statement that germination is a
prerequisite for successful vernalization).  I would add: good
synchronizing is a prerequisite for unambiguous vernalization results.
For unvernalized plants one proceeds after 24 hrs under light as
follows:<p>

b) Seedling growth<p>

1.  Transfer to dark (24*degrees*C).  Here visible germination
follows.  After 2 or 3 days hypocotyles are uniformly, e.g., 1-1 1/2
cm long.<p>

2.  Then transfer petridishes to light (as a3) for 1 day (vigorous
seedlings) or better 2 days.  Cotyledons turn green.<p>

3.  Soul culture in, e.g., greenhouse.  Put seedlings with blocks of
agar (use spatula) into small holes. Agar is incised (e.g., with glass
tube) before etiolation.  Press some soil over agar.  During the first
few days the seedlings are very sensitive to drying out (a main cause
of disuniformity). Agar acts as a water reservoir and decays after
some time. Soul splashing often is detrimental to uniformity, and
etiolation now enables the cotyledons to be well free from the soil.
Nevertheless use a fine spray in the beginning.  Sheltering against
bright sunlight is with a wood lattice.<p>

4.  When seedlings are well established, hard soil surace or algal
growth can spoil much, and can be avoided by a well-balanced
sterilized leaf soil mixture.<p>

5.  Uniformity of field of additional light is important, specially in
winterseason Philips TL 55 daylight type is very satisfactory for
germination (see A3), formative processes, seed setting and ripening,
but for long-day simulation incandescent bulbs are required.<p>
