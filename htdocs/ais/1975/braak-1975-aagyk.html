In order to isolate nitrate reductase-less mutants M2 offsprings of
18,000 M1 plants treated with N-methyl-N-nitrosoguanidine (NG) and
17,000 M1 plants treated with ethylmethanesulphonate (EMS) were
screened for chlorate-resistant mutants. The NG treatment yielded 1
mutant, exhibiting a lowered level of nitrate reductase activity
(chl-2) and 14 mutants of type chl-1, with a lower uptake of chlorate
(reported previously, Van der LAAN e.a. 1971; OOSTINDIER-BRAAKSMA and
FEENSTRA 1973b and 1974), 7 mutants with a lowered level of nitrate
reductase activity (isolation numbers B29, B31-1, B31-2, B33, B35, B36
and B40), and 37 mutants of type chl-1. EMS appears to be a more
suitable mutagen than NG for the type of mutations we are are looking
for.<p>

Complementation tests showed that the mutants B29, B31-2, B33 and B35
belong to the same complementation group.  All newly isolated mutants
showed complementation with the previously isolated mutants chl-2 and
B25.<p>

Linkage date obtained thus far suggest that B40 may be closely linked
with chl-2; B31-1 and B36 may be linked with chl-2, but not closely;
the mutants B29, B31-2, B33 and B35 are not linked with chl-2.  All
mutants with a low level of nitrate reductase activity showed
independent segregation with B25.  Localisation experiments with
marker lines are presently being pursued. The first results show that
B25 is probably very closely linked with the marker an, even so close
that it appears to be difficult to isolate a double mutant line. Since
an is in chromosome 1 (REDEI and HIRONO, 1964; REDEI, 1965) this
suggests that the B25 mutation and chl-2 are in different chromosomes,
since chl-2 was located in chromosome 2 (OSSTINDIER-BRAAKSMA and
FEENSTRA 1973a and 1973b).<p>

When mutants with a low nitrate reductase activity (5-10 times lower
than in the wildtype) are grown on media containing nitrate, extracts
of most of them show, when compared to wildtype, an enhanced nitrate
content and a 2-4 times higher nitrite reductase activity. The mutant
B25, exhibiting no nitrate reductase acvitity, shows a high nitrate
content and an extremely high level of nitrite reductase activity.
Enzyme induction experiments were carried out with wildtype and B25
rosettes, which, after having grown on perlite substrate with ammonium
as the N-source, were cut off and transferred to a liquid medium, to
which, after 16 hours of N-starvation, nitrate (6 mM) was added as the
only N-source.  Increase of nitrite reductase activity was more rapid
and to a higher level in B25 than in wildtype.  These results suggest
that synthesis of nitrite reductase is induced by nitrate rather than
by nitrite.  More support for this hypothesis comes from the finding
that plants of wildtype and B25, when grown on nitrite medium, show a
nitrite reductase activity about equal to that found in plants grown
on ammonium medium, and thus considerabley lower than in plants grown
on nitrate.<p>
