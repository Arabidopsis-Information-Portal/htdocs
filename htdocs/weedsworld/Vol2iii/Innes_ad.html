<hr>
 
Applications are invited for graduate fellowships in 
the Plant Biotechnology Training Program at Indiana 
University.  This program is funded by the USDA National 
Needs Fellowship (NNF) Program, and provides stipends 
of $17,000 per year, plus a full tuition scholarship. 
 <P>

	NNF fellows will be able to choose among eight plant 
biotechnology laboratories (directed by Carl Bauer, 
Mark Estelle, Roger Hangarter, Roger Innes, Cheng Kao, 
Jeffrey Palmer, Robert Togasaki, and Miriam Zolan) 
that are affiliated with the Biology Department and 
the Indiana Institute for Molecular and Cellular Biology. 
 These eight laboratories encompass a broad range of 
areas in plant biotechnology, including disease resistance 
genes, plant-virus and plant-bacteria interactions, 
genome evolution, hormones and development, plant responses 
to light and gravity, carbon assimilation, DNA repair 
and meiosis, and chlorophyll biosynthesis.  Accordingly, 
our training program provides both breadth and depth. 
 We emphasize a solid foundation in molecular genetics 
as it is applied to all organisms, not just plants. 
 This enables our students to approach questions in 
plant biology from a broad perspective, and to take 
advantage of the wealth of knowledge that has been 
garnered from animal and yeast systems and apply it 
to plants.  Broad training also allows our students 
to easily move into new areas as they progress through 
their research careers.  For more details on our graduate 
training curriculum and the research programs of the 
IU biology facult please visit our World Wide Web Site

eight participating faculty listed below. <BR>
