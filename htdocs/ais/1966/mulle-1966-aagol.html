	Presoaked seeds of Arabidopsis were treated for 30 min at 36*degrees*C with the trifunctional alkylating agent tri-2-chloroethylamine HC1 (HN3).  After treatment the seeds were soaked either in water for 3 h at 36*degrees*C or in 2 mM NaN3 for 1 h and after that in water for 3 h.  Root length reduction (r), degree of sterility (s) and frequency of recessive lethals were determined.<p>

	The hydrolysate tested was obtained by keeping 15 mM for 1 h at 90*degrees*C.  The results show that,
(1) the relation between root length reduction (inhibition of mitosis) and mutation frequency is considerably higher than after treatment with EMS,
(2) the relation between degree of sterility and mutation frequency is essentially the same as after treatment with monofunctional agents (e.g.k EMS),
(3) posttreatment with NaN3 enhance both the frequency of chlorophyll
mutations (m'b) and the frequency of embryonic lethals.<p>
