The International Max Planck Research School in Primary Metabolism and Plant
Growth

offers several doctoral fellowships

starting fall 2007

The recently founded International Max Planck Research School (IMPRS) in
Primary Metabolism and Plant Growth will focus on a systems oriented
approach with an emphasis on both the application of a variety of molecular
phenotyping technologies (Omics) and of bioinformatics, specifically on data
integration and modelling. In this joint initiative of the Max Planck
Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology and the University of Potsdam
doctoral students will receive a high level and true interdisciplinary
education covering genetics, cutting edge analytical techniques and
bioinformatics. Doctoral studies will focus to a large extent on the model
organism Arabidopsis thaliana. The programme¹s language is English and no
tuitions apply.
