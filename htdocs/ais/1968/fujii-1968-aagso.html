The killing effects of gamma-rays and thermal neutrons on seeds soaked
in water for 48 hours have been compared, and drastic effects of
neutrons were observed (FUJII, 1967).  The aim of the present
experiment was to determine whether the damage of high LET radiations
is modified by the water content of the treated material.  For these
studies irradiations with fast neutron were also included.<p>

Dry and 24 hrs presoaked seeds were used.  Thermal neutron exposures
were done with the pneumatic tube which was provided in the reactor of
the Kyoto University; the irradiation time was 10-150 sec with an out
put of 50 kW; the total neutron flux, therefore, was 3.9 x 10 12 in
minimum and 7.1 x 10 13 in maximum.  The neutron beam of the pneumatic
tube consisted of about 90% thermal neutrons and 10% fast neutrons,
with a high gamma-ray contamination.  Equal samples were also exposed
to monoenergetic 14 MeV neutrons from the T(d,n) reaction neutron
generator in our institute.  Its total neutron flux was 3.8 x 10 11 -
1.8 x 10 13 with the average intensity of 10 9 neutrons/sec; here the
gamma-ray contamination was less than 10%. Thus the neutron effect is
expected to mask over the effect of the contaminating gamma-rays
because of its high RBE.<p>

The decrease of the survival rates after the neutron irradiation is
shown in the table together with the results of the previous gamma-ray
experiment, for comparison.  In the experiment with thermal neutrons
severe killing was again observed: almost all plants died after a flux
of 71. 5x10 12 neutrons on dry seeds and similar survival rates were
observed after 35.6x10 12 on wet seeds while 37.5 kR of gamma-rays
alone had no effect on dry seeds and 16.5 kR might only slightly
affect wet seeds.  Thus the killing effect of thermal neutrons is very
high, and it seems to result from the high LET of the radiation
modified by the water content of the material.  But, the assessment of
thermal neutrons' RBE is much complicated because of its
multi-energetic condition and the abundance of contaminated
gamma-rays. The survival rates in the neutron series are rather high
compared to those of the gamma series, both in dry and wet seeds.
Moreover, 48 hrs of soaking were used in the gamma-ray experiment
while only 24 hrs in the neutron samples.  This difference may also
influence the intensity of cell or tissue killing.<p>

Fast neutron irradiations of dry and wet seeds also showed an effect
of the water content. The survival rates in wet seeds after 19 or
35x10 11 neutrons were about half of those in dry seeds. The fast
neutron doses which the seeds received, were calculated from the first
collision dose converted from the given tissue dose by using chemical
seed analyses; the dosage in rad unit is reckoned from the multiplied
total neutron flux by 5.98x10-9.  From the calculations, 3.8 and
35.0x10 10 neutrons are equivalent to 2.27 and 20l93 krad,
respectively. When the results are compared with those after
gamma-irradiation, the neutrons prove to be nearly 10 times more
effective in dry and about 5 times in wet seeds at the LD50 level.
Modifications of radiation damage by the water content are known in 14
MeV neutron exposures. But nevertheless, the modification factor is
too large in the present experiment, though the environmental
modification of radiation effects is generally very small in high LET
radiation. Further study is now underway.<p>
