*For Brazilian student only-The laboratory of Functionnal Genomics and Effector Biology invites applications at the Ph.D. level for a project in
Molecular Plant-Microbe Interaction.*
*
*

Through the *Ciência sem Fronteiras* Brazilian scholarship program our laboratory wishes to recruit a candidate to fill a Ph.D. level position in molecular and cellular biology to study plant pathogen effector biology with an emphasis on Arabidopsis immunity. The candidate should have a strong background in molecular biology and plant biology. Competence and experience in plant-microbe interaction, genomics, bioinformatics, cellular biology and Arabidopsis growth and genetics are assets. In addition, since our university is located in the French-speaking province of Québec in Canada *a good knowledge of the French language is required to apply for the scholarship competition*.

The candidate must hold, a Master Degree (or must be finishing a Master degree) or equivalent diploma, and should have a good academic record. Excellence of the candidate, both at the academic level and in research as well the fit of the candidate with the proposed project based on previous experience and interest of the candidate will be decisive factors. The candidates must provide a list of their publication in peer reviewed journal and the name of two references. Interested candidate can send their CV to *germainhugo@gmail.com*.

Located in Trois-Rivières, Qc, Canada, the University of Trois-Rivières is a research focused institution that provides extraordinary support to its graduate students. The projects hosted in the Germain lab ( www.germainhugo.com) focuses on pathogen effector biology with an emphasis on Arabidopsis immunity and intracellular targets of biotrophic pathogen effectors. Additional research is also conducted on mRNA export and nuclear proteomic.
