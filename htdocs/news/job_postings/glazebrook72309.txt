Post-Doc Position Available
Glazebrook lab, Department of Plant Biology, University of Minnesota

A post-doctoral associate is needed to work on the NSF-funded project “Analysis of the Role of CBP60 
Proteins in Defense Signaling”.  The successful applicant will take primary responsibility for the research 
related to the project.  The research goals are to understand the roles of the calmodulin-binding protein 
CBP60g and the related, non-calmodulin binding protein CBP60h in activation of salicylate signaling in 
response to pathogen attack in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana.   The position requires a Ph.D. in a 
suitable area of biology.  The successful applicant will have demonstrated ability in independent design 
and execution of molecular biology experiments, scientific writing, and working well as part of a 
research team.  

The position is in the laboratory of Dr. Jane Glazebrook in the Department of Plant Biology, University of 
Minnesota.  The University is a first-rate research institution and is well-equipped with modern 
instrumentation and computing resources.  The laboratory is located in the Cargill Microbial and Plant 
Genomics building, which has a modern open lab design, built in 2003.  The Twin Cities of Minneapolis 
and St. Paul comprise a vibrant urban area.  Some early work on the project has been published (Wang 
et al., PLoS Pathogens, 5(2): e1000301. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1000301 (2009)).  For more 
information, or to apply, contact Jane Glazebrook at jglazebr@umn.edu.
