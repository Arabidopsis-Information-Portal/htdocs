AIS Vol 02:<h2>The LAIBACH Standard Collection of Natural Races</h2><p>

G. ROBBELEN<p>

(Institute of Agronomy and Plant Breeding, University of Gottingen,
Germany)<p>

It is already 60 years since the student Friedrich LAIBACH collected
seeds of an inconspicuously small Crucifer and determined its
chromosome number to be as low as n=5.  From that time, especially in
the late thirties, Prof. LAIBACH brought together multiple races in
order to assemble a versatile collection of Arabidopsis thaliana for
developmental and genetical research.  Most of these stocks and
records, however, were lost in the last war's chaos.  But LAIBACH did
really spare no pains to fill the gaps, and the collection again
arrived at a size of more than 100 different types.<p>

Since the exponential growth of Arabidopsis research, LAIBACH
generously distributed seeds of these races to everyone.  His
collection thus gained the rank of a standard sortiment in a short
time.  Therefore it appeared desirable to place a comparative
description of its main types at everyones disposal.<p>

With this in view 120 races from 89 places were sown at the 28.- 29.1.
1964 on soil in the greenhouses of the Institute of Agronomy and Plant
Breeding, Gottingen (together with 29 forms collected from 20 places
by the author).  They were transplanted 2-3 weeks later and examined
all over their lifetime for morphological and developmental
characters. The following tables represent a compilation of these data
completed by notes kindly contributed by Prof. LAIBACH.<p>

From the beginning the races were named after the place of their
origin.  For symbolization the earlier uses have been modified, and
every newly collected type is now denoted with the first and third
letter of its name (this conditioning more combinations!).  The
original strain population) gets the suffix "O", while lines
segregating out of this initial collection are signed with consecutive
numbers.<p>

The purpose of the following presentation is threefold:<p>

1.  to make the reader familiar with the enormous variability within
this collection enabling him to select more specifically those races
specially suited for his experimental equirements,<p>

2.  to eliminate deviating types being propagated somewhere under the
original designation though heavily mixed up (please compare your
races with the descriptions and in case of differences send some seeds
to the editor of AIS for comparison!) and<p>

3.  To stimulate the collection of new races from natural locations
wherever available, for complementing the present assortment.
Everyone is kindly asked to note for each new sample collected as
precisely as possible: the place of origin, its exposition and
inclination, type of soil, association (plant community) and dominant
anthropogenic factors.<p>

57 new races have kindly been placed at the disposal of AIS in 1964 by
several active members, such as BURGER, DAHLGREN, LAIBACH, MARTEUS,
MUSCH, RATCLIFFE, ROBBELEN and JEREMIAS.  These races will be included
into the standard collection after comparative culture in 1965.  Seeds
of all races, the older as well as the new ones, can be received at
request by the way of Arabidopsis Information Service.<p>
