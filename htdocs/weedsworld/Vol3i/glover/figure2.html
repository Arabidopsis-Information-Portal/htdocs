Figure 2: Representative DNA gel blot analysis of DNA from plants from Line
178.<BR>
DNA was isolated from individual plants. The genotype of these plants was
determined by scoring in the next generation for those plants that produced
seed. Lanes are labelled as follows : MM - homozygous male fertile plants,
Mm - heterozygous plants, and mm - homozygous male sterile plants. The DNA
was cleaved with EcoRI, resolved on an agarose gel, transferred onto nylon,
and hybridised to a radiolabelled probe derived from the right border of
the T-DNA. Sizes (in kilobases) of the DNA fragments are shown on the left.
DNA representing 210 individual F2 plants was analysed in this manner. The
larger T-DNA hybridising EcoRI fragment segregated with the <I>ms</I> mutation
in these plants.<BR></body>
