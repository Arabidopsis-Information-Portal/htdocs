A method comparable to microbial techniques was devised for use with
Arabidopsis in diverse genetic, biochemical and physiological studies.
The technique will be especially useful in screening for auxotrophs,
determining resistance to chemicals, detection of environmental
mutagens, and as described below, the study of reversion.<p>

Mutant A-154 was previously reported as being sensitive to valine
(Acedo and Redei, 1976), and reversion to valine intensitivity will be
detected by germination and growth on valine.<p>

The minimal media (composition according to Redei, 1962) was
solidified with 0.6 percent agar and supplmented with 2 percent
glucose and 10E-3M valine. After autocalving for 10 minutes, the media
was poured into sterile Petri plates. Seeds of mutant A-154, after
disinfection in 5 percent calcium hypochlorite for 8 minutes were
suspended in .12 percent agar (as used by Redei and Acedo, 1976) in
test tubes. Measured amounts of seeds in the agar were poured on the
congealed media in the Petri plates and spread with an L-shaped rod.
The plates are placed in an environment favourable to germination
(kept in the laboratory, or in an incubator). Revertants which are
expected to be detected by growth on this media can be transferred to
soil in pots and grown to maturity.<p>

The technique is very simple, fast and inexpensive. The seeded Petri
plates need only a small space and millions of seeds can be tested at
a time.<p>
