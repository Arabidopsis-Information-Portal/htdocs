Dominant (and semi-dominant) chlorophyll mutations in higher plants
are rare events. The frequency of their occurrence is not more than
several percent of that for recessive chlorophyll mutations
(Gostimsky, 1981; Sidorova, 1981; Mednik and Usmanov, 1982). However,
the interest towards this type of mutation is explained not only by
its rarity and unstudied character of their genetic nature, but also
by the perspective which opens the undertanding of the genetic
determination and functioning of the photosynthetic apparatus and the
solving of some aspects of the genetic analysis in higher plants. But
the use and study of dominant chlorophyll mutations is complicated by
the difficutlties to receive them; the genetic analysis of tens or
hundreds of mutations is needed for their isolation. That is why
working out of methods allowing to reduce the mass of originally
tested material is of particular interest. In this paper data are
suggested that allow to estimate the effectiveness of isolation of
nonrecessive pigmant mutations in A. thaliana from chlorophyll
chimeras (ChCh) of the 1st generation (m 1) after mutagen treatment of
seeds.)<p>

Air-dry seeds of A. thaliana, race Enkheim (En) were soaked during 18
hours at 20*degrees*C in aqueous solution of N-nitroso-N-methylurea
(NMU) of various concentration: from 100 up to 400 mM. Then the seeds
were washed in tap water and sown on agarized medium in Petri dishes,
and at the stage of 4 rosette leaves the seedlings were transplanted
into pots with soil. Further, the appearance of chlorotic segments on
the M 1 plants was recorded and the seeds for the analysis in M 2 and
M 3 were gathered from inflourescences which were formed by these
segments. In view of the fact that high sterility of M 1-plants was
observed in the experiment, especially at concentrations of MNU higher
than 200 mM, the majority of chlorotic infloresences were additionally
pollinated by the pollen of nontreated plants, race En. The frequency
of lethal chlorophyll mutations (LChM) was scored by the method of
embryo-test.<p>

The data on the yield of ChCh and LChM are given as follows.<p>

Table 1: Total for all concentrations of NMU<p>

Chlorotic inflorescences (pale-yellow, yellow and yellow-green colour)
were formed on 26 plants, but in spite of additional pollination the
seeds were gathered only from 17 plants and from 12 of them only 2-10
seeds per plant could be gathered. From these 17 plants only 6 gave
seedlings of which fertile plants were received. The analysis of M 2
and M 3 of these plants showed the following: In the progeny of 2
plants (yellow blots on the leaves and yellow side inflorescences)
only normal plants were observed in M 2 and M 3; in this case ChCh in
M 1 were formed obviously by physiological reasons. In the progeny of
the 3rd plant (light-green side inflorescences) only one plant of
normal colour was received in M 2, in the progeny of which (M 3) the
segregation of normal and light-green plants was observed close to 3
normal : 1 light-green. This shows the recessivity of the mutation and
the formation of the light-green inflorescences in M 1 can be
explained by somatic crossingover (Rapoport and Demchenko, 1969). Data
on the segregation in other plants are given in Table 2.<p>

Table 2: Segregation in the progeny of chlorotic inflorescence.<p>

Among these plants 3 classes were observed in M 2: pale-yellow
seedlings dying at the stage of cotyledons; yellow-green vital fertile
plants and normal ones. All the plants appeared to be self fertile,
however, as they were also additionally pollinated we can draw a
conclusion on the character of inheritance only on the basis of
segregation of yellow-green self-pollinated plants, i.e., in M 3.<p>

The existence of 3 distinctly different phenotypic classes in M 2 and
M 3 clearly shows the nonrecessive character of the inheritance of
mutations 100 C4, 100 B2 and Estd2. In 100 C4 and Estd2 the
segregation in the progeny of yellow-green plants is very close to
1:2:1 (Table 2), and since light yellow seedlings die, there are all
reasons to account these to be dominant chlorophyll mutations with
recessive lethal effect. It is more difficult to explain the
segregation for 100 B2, because if one supposes the same type of
inheritance, than there is a surplus of phenotypically normal plants
and a sharp deficiency of expected heterozygotes (Table 2). However,
after the self-pollination of 8 phenotypically normal plants, in the
progeny of 5 of them again 3 classes were found. Therefore,
establishing for 100 B2 the nonrecessive character of the inheritance,
we can suppose that 100 B2 is also a dominant chlorophyll mutation
with recessive lethal effect and incomplete penetration of the mutant
character in the heterozygotes.<p>

On the whole, the method used can be accounted quite effectively for
screening of recessive chlorophyll mutations in A. thaliana. At the
isolation of the given class of mutations the main bulk of the work is
connected with the growth and analysis of M 2 and M 3. Taking it into
consideration the given method decreases many times the bulk of work:
instead of the analysis of the progeny of 1200 plants in M 1 and 130
plants in M 3 we analysed only the M 2 from 26 plants of M 1, and the
M 3 from 6 plants of M 2. It certainly compensates for some extending
of the number of procedures in M 1: the registration of ChCh and the
additional pollination of chlorotic inflorescences. The drawback of
the method is that it can not allow to isolate all the arising
nonrecessive chlorophyll mutations, as several of them arise without
manifestation of chimerism in M 1 (Salnikova and ZOZ, 1966); however,
the fraction of such mutations is not great and in most cases it is
defined by the thoroughness of the record of ChCh in M 1.<p>

The experiment carried out allows to suggest other interesting
conclusions. One could have expected that the fraction of ChCh
observed in M 1 is caused by mutations of cytoplasmic genes, however,
we could not isolate such mutations. Taking into account the fact that
80% of chlorotic inflorescences appeared to be sterile even at
additional pollination or gave nongerminating seeds (at the same time
normal inflorescences from these plants were to some extent self
fertile) we can suppose that cytoplasmic mutations in A. thaliana lead
to the sterility of maternal type, and in order to obtain the
cytoplasmic mutants it is necessary in the first place to work out the
methods to overcome this fertility. Possibly the obtaining of
regenerants from the chlorotic segments of ChCh will appear to be an
effective device in working out such methods, and, perhaps, for the
isolation of dominant pigment mutations.<p>

The data obtained allow to estimate roughly the frequency of arising
chlorophyll mutations. Summarizing the data of this study, with those
obtained earlier (Mednik and Usmanov, 1982) we see that from 241
registered lethal and vital chlorophyll mutations only 5 (i.e., 2.1%)
appeared to be nonrecessive. It is interesting to see that among these
5 mutations there is no really dominant one; among all of them the
lethality of homozygotes at the normal level of vitality of
heterozygotes is observed. The cause of the lack of dominant pigment
mutations in A. thaliana is not clear; the most possible explanation
is that with increase of the quantity of isolated nonrecessive
mutations there will be found mutations of the given class.<p>

In conclusion, the observations on chlorophyll chimerism in M 1 allow
to estimate the numbers of initial cells of the vegetative tissues of
A. thaliana. From 138 ChCh which had chlorotic blots on the leaves, 26
gave chlorotic segments in the apical inflorescence. It is clear that
the ratio of these two numbers equals (to within diplontic selection)
to the ratio of the initial cells of vegetative and generative
meristems; and as in the generative meristem of intact plants of A.
thaliana there are on an average 3 to 3.5 initial cells (Muller, 1964;
Mednik and Usmanov unpubl.) the number of initial cells of the
vegetative meristem of A. thaliana approximately equals 15.9 to 18.6.
This confirms the estimation of Redei, and Li (1969).<p>
