	In earlier experiments (CETL, DOBROVOLNA, and EFFMERTOVA, 1965; CETL, 1965) the developmental characters of natural populations were studied under artificial conditions. Thus, it appeared desirable to know the behaviour of these populations in field conditions when the usual time limits of the seed shedding were maintained.<p>

	For this purpose twelve different populations were chosen according to the percentage of generative plants and to the earliness of the generative plant fraction ascertained in laboratory experiments (25+/- 3*degrees*C, continuous illumination 1250 lux).  Among these populations there were four "summer annual" (two early: Vra, MBu, and two late:  Kr-5, DK-2), five "mixed" (two with about 50% generative plants:  Bo-1, Bi-2a, and three with about 25% generative plants:  MB, He-2, Kr-1, and three "winter annual" (Be, Bi-2b, Ne).  For comparison 9 homozygous early and late races were used (S-96, Di, Li-5, Li-2, H-55, H-48, H-51, H-68, and St. Cf. Van der VEEN, 1965; NAPP-ZINN, 1957, 1963).<p>

	All these samples were sown in 10-inch pots with 15 seeds each in three replications on March 3, 1966.  The pots were placed in the experimental garden of the Department. The early sowing was necessary for removing the differences in the earliness; in the first few weeks after sowing the vernalization requirement was fully covered in winter annual types while the summer annual ones were inhibited in development by low temperatures and by short days.  In consequence, the development was almost simultaneous in all samples.  Immediately before lowering the pots were covered with polyethylene bags for prevention of crossing and mixing of seeds. The majority of seeds was shed between June 20 and 23.  At the same time the mother plants and bags were removed.  Every week generative plants (with visible flower primordia or already flowering) were scored and removed. At the end of the vegetation period (October 19) the remaining vegetative plants were counted and classified according to size of rosettes.  Since the germination could not be pursued quantitatively during the experiment it was only possible to judge its course indirectly with the aid of this classification.<p>

	The results in the figure show that in races as well as in populations the total percentage of generative plants was diminishing from the earliest types to the latest ones.  In early races, and populations without a vernalization reaction, practically all plants flowered during summer and fall while in the late ones almost all plants remained vegetative because of their vernalization requirement.  This means that the conclusions on the developmental character according to the laboratory results correspond to the situation in nature.<p>

	It must be taken into account that the seeds of all generative plants had to germinate in a short time after shedding as it is in agreement with the visual observation of germination.  For this reason these plants could develop in favourable conditions of temperature and photoperiod.  On the other hand, the very small part of vegetative plants in early types had to germinate considerably later than the generative ones.<p>

	In late types there was a conspicuous difference between races and populations:  the majority of plants in races was represented by large rosettes which indicate that they germinated relatively early, while in the populations the plants occurred mostly as small rosettes or seedlings and showed that they germinated only at the end of the summer period.  Therefore, in natural conditions the after-ripening requirement of late (winter annual) populations seems to be greater than those of the races in which selectional changes in the direction to the shortening of the after-ripening period are possible.<p>

	Generally, it can be concluded from the given data that in field conditions the behaviour of a type is dependent not only on the earliness or lateness determined by an interaction of the vernalization and photoperiodic requirement but also on the after ripening conditions.<p>
