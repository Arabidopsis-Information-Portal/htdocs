considerable advantages to making them yourself.  The preferred 
mutagen is Ethyl Methanesulphonate (EMS) because it is a powerful 
mutagen, but causes little lethality.  EMS is a volatile, colourless liquid 
and all manipulations involving it should be carried out in an 'Atmos' bag 
in a fume hood (Atmos bags and EMS  can be obtained from Sigma.  
EMS is listed as Methanesulfonic acid Ethyl Ester).  The technique is 
straight-forward and is outlined below.  The mutagenesis procedure is 
adapted from chapter 6 of Bibliographica Genetica XXI 1969 by George 
Redei.  This chapter includes detailed information on the use of EMS 
and other mutagenic treatments in Arabidopsis.

1.  MUTAGENESIS
  (i) Pre-imbibe a known number of seeds o/n in a 0.1% solution of 
potassium chloride. (N.B. 250 Landsberg erecta seeds weigh 
approximately 5 mg.)
  (ii) Soak the seeds for 3-5 hours in a solution of 0.1M sodium 
phosphate, pH 5, 5% Dimethyl Sulphoxide, and 50-100mM EMS.  We 
have found that concentrations of EMS in this range give a high 
frequency of mutation in the M1; the use of 200mM EMS results in little 
lethality, but M1 plants are sterile.  Typically we mutagenise 5,000 seeds 
in 20 ml of the above solution.
 *  Steps (ii)-(iv) must be carried out in an 'Atmos' bag in a fume hood 
which can make  manipulating the seed cumbersome.  We use adapted 
10 ml  syringes to hold the seeds  throughout the entire procedure.  
These are  made by cutting off the front end of the syringe  and 
attaching a circle of fine nylon mesh in its place.  The seeds are placed in 
the syringe and  the plunger can then be used to draw the appropriate 
solutions through the  nylon mesh onto  the seeds.

  (iii) Wash the seeds twice in 100mM sodium thiosulphate for 15 min.  
Sodium thiosulphate destroys the EMS.  All waste solutions must be 
discarded into a beaker containing solid sodium thiosulphate.
  (iv) Wash the seeds twice in distilled water for 15 min.
  (v) Open the 'Atmos' bag, pour the sodium thiosulphate inactivated 
waste into the sink and wash down with plenty of water.  Leave  all 
beakers, etc, used in the procedure under running water for half an 
hour.
  (vi) Transfer the seeds to 3MM (Whatman) paper and allow them to dry 
out o/n.
  (vii) Dilute seed into dry sand to make their distribution easier.  Plant at a 
density of 1cm-2.
 *  This generation of plants is called the M1 generation.  An indication 
that the mutagenesis  has been successful is the appearance of 
chlorophyll deficient sectors at low frequency  among the M1 plants (1 in 
100-1000 plants).

 *  Under our conditions these plants mature in 6-8 weeks where upon 
the M2  generation can  be harvested.  Recessive and dominant 
mutations can be recovered from this generation.  In  a successful 
mutagenesis 0.5-3% of M1 plants segregate chlorophyll deficient plants 
in their  M2 progeny.

2.  SEED HARVESTING
 *  There are several strategies for harvesting the M2  seed.  The most 
appropriate method will  depend on the nature of the mutant screen you 
want to carry out.  The two extremes of the  spectrum are:
  (i) to keep the seed harvested from each M1 plant separate and 
generate a collection of M2 families.
  (ii) to pool all the seed harvested from the M1 plants to give a bulked M2 
population. (Lehle seeds supplies a bulked M2.).
 *Although harvesting and screening each M2 family separately is labour  
intensive there are two  main advantages to this approach.  Firstly, it 
offers the possibility for recovering mutations  which are infertile when 
homozygous via the heterozygous siblings of the mutant  plants.   
Secondly, this strategy guarantees the independence of all mutants 
isolated.  This ensures  that mutations isolated from the M2 collection 
that are subsequently found to be allelic are  known to be different 
alleles at the same locus rather than 2 isolates of the same mutational  
event.

 *  If the mutants you are looking for are unlikely to be infertile or if the 
screen  you are carrying  out would be much more difficult to do with 
individual families then these advantages may be  outweighed and a 
compromise strategy of screening groups of M2 families together might 
be  preferable.

 *  It is impossible to predict in advance the frequency at which a new 
mutant class will be  observed in the M2.  Similarly, it is impossible to 
assess how large an M2 population  should be  in order to be sure of 
finding one or more mutants.  In practice such screens are usually limited  
by the effort involved.  If a mutant class is rare, increasing the size of M1 
may increase the  probability of recovering it more than simply screening 
a greater number of M2 plants from the  same mutagenesis.  For 
example, if a particular trait cannot be found in a M2 population twenty  
times the size of M1 it probably cannot be recovered from the
