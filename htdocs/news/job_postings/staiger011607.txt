Research associate Plant Molecular Biology

 
Bielefeld University, Germany

 
A position is open for a research associate to work on Arabidopsis or other 
Brassicaceae.

Possible areas of research include the molecular basis of circadian rhythms and 
interaction of the circadian system with the environment, plant stress 
responses, post-transcriptional control mechanisms or related topics.

Our group enjoys strong collaborations with the Department of Physics as part of 
the collaborative research program SFB 613 “Single molecule processes and 
molecular recognition” to study RNA-protein interaction and subcellular 
localization.

The position is available for 3 years initially with the possibility of a long 
term extension.

Applications are encouraged from candidates with a strong background in 
molecular biology, plant physiology, tissue culture and experience in transcript 
profiling.

The candidate will participate in the teaching program and the supervision of 
Bachelor, Master and PhD students.
