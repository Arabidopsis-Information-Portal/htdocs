Nitrate reductase negative mutants of Nicotiana tabacum have been
isolated in cell cultures by Moller and Grafe (1978) using a
chlorate-containing medium with amino acids as nitrogen source. The
mutant cells are unable to grow on a standard medium containing
nitrate as sole nitrogen source or on media with ammonium, with or
without nitrate. When a low level of enzyme activity is left the
mutant cells can be cultured on a medium with ammonium as nitrogen
source. In the investigations reported here the growth of cells of A.
thaliana on a medium with nitrate and ammonium (PG2; Negrutiu et al.,
1975) was compared with growth on other nitrogen sources as part of an
attempt to isolate nitrate reductase-less mutants of A. thaliana by
selection for chlorate resistance in cell cultures. These
investigations were stimulated by the observation that in cultures of
A. thaliana kept in the dark the concentration of the mutagenic
nitrite was three times as high as in cultures kept in light. Since
most cells are cultured in dark other nitrogen sources than nitrate
might be desirable for a stable culture.<p>

In the table presented the results are given of some growth
experiments of wildtype and a nitrate reductase-less mutant of A.
thaliana isolated in plant stage (B25; Oostindier-Braaksma and
Feenstra, 1974).<p>

As can be seen in Table 1, growth of wild type cells on a medium with
amino acids as nitrogen source is comparable to that of medium with
nitrate and ammonium. B25-cells exhibit a low level of enzyme activity
and therefore may be expected to use ammonium as nitrogen source
without being effected by ammonium toxicity. As expected B25 shows an
increase in growth on a medium with amino acids.<p>

nitrogen sources<p>

Amino acids as nitrogen source also appear to have a positive effect
on the sensitivity of cells of A. thaliana for chlorate. The first
results indicate that cells cultured on PG11 are sensitive to chlorate
concentrations above 100 ppm. whereas cells grown on PG2 show no
effect of chlorate with concentrations up to 500 ppm. This increased
sensitivity to chlorate can shorten the period of selection and
prevent damage by chlorate without reduction to chlorite but due to
accumulation in the cells to toxic concentrations.<p>

From the results reported here it was concluded that when selection
for chlorate resistance is used to isolate nitrate reductase-less
mutants of A. thaliana in cell cultures use of a medium with amino
acids as nitrogen source gives sufficient growth of the cultures with
an increased sensitivity to chlorate and avoids ammonium toxicity.<p>
