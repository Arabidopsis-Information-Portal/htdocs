INTRODUCTION<p>

In this study we are dealing with the effect of gamma irradiation on
seeds of plants from natural populations of Arabidopsis thaliana
growing at different altitudes. The habitat of the populations is the
southern slope of Gissersky mountain ridge (Pamiro-Alay). USMANOV et
al. (1978) have considered in great detail the climatic conditions of
this region and the temporal characteristics of population's
vegetation cycle. According to these authors, natural populations of
Arabidopsis growing in Tajikistan differ markedly from one another in
a number of traits and in the fraction of cross polinating plants.
Populations growing at different altitudes have also been shown to
differ in the relative number of winter and spring forms. The latter
fact is of considerable interest for further studies of the genetic
control of this character in plants (USMANOV et al., 1978; Khurmatov
and Shevchenko, 1981). Cetl (1979) studied Arabidopsis populations of
Khodga-Obi-Garm and Moravia and revealed certain heterogeneity between
them in the onset of flowering.<p>

MATERIAL AND METHODS<p>

The subject of the present study were Arabidopsis seeds originating
from three regions of Tajikistan: Kondara (1100 m), Khodga-Obi-Garm
(1800 m) and Sorbo (2200 m above sea-level).<p>

Table 1: Effect of gamma-rays on germination capacity of seeds and
survival of seedlings in Arabidopsis thaliana from three natural
populations growing at different altitudes.<p>

The seeds were studied with regard to their resistance to gamma
irradiation (doses: 40, 80, 160 and 240 kr). The population studies
displayed significant differences from one another in their
radioresistance analysed under laboratory conditions following
irradiation of air-dried seeds (moisture content 5%) at different
doses. The parameters assayed were germination capacity, viability,
rate of growth (length of root on 7th day) and some others.<p>

RESULTS<p>

As it is shown in Table 1, irradiation at 240 kr produced little
effect on the germination capacity of seeds from all three
populations. The exceptionally high radio resistance of A. thaliana
seeds seems to be due to the small size of the chromosomes and seeds,
as well as to the complete type of embryogenetic charactristic of
Arabidopsis seeds (Ivanov, 1974).<p>

We also studied dose-response reltionships for the three populations
Table 1 and Figure 1 present data on germination capacity and plant
survival as detrmined in the cotyledon phase of growth. Irradiation of
seeds caused death of plants at very early stages. According to Ivanov
(1974), this is due to radiation injury of meristematic cells in the
embryos. As can be seen from Figure 1, the Khodga-Obi-Garm population
(1800 m) is the most resistant by the survival criterion.<p>

Figure 2: Relative length of root (control - 100%) depending on dose
(1- Kondara, 2- Khodga-Obi-Garm, 3-Sorbo)<p>

Table 2 and Figure 2 show plant growth rate for the three populations
measured as the length of root 7 days after the onset of germination.
The Khodga-Obi-Garm population is the most resistant by this
criterion, too. The dose resulting in a 50% reduction of growth rate,
as detrmined from the dose-response curves, equals 35 kr, 60 kr and 46
kr for the Kondara, Khodga-Obi-Garm and Sorbo populations,
respectively. We also identified doses which induce stimulation (up to
40 kr) or inhibition (over 160 kr) of plant growth and development.<p>

CONCLUSION<p>

It is demonstrated that natural Arabidopsis populations growing at
different altitudes differ in their radioresistance. The 1800
m-population is the most resistant one, while those inhabiting higher
or lower altitudes are less resistant. Supposingly, the altitude
function of radioresistance is not linear but rather has a maximum
which may be due to the existence, for each plant species, of a set of
optimum conditions (including, in particular, the habitat altitude)
that ensures maximum radioresistance. Another contributing factor in
Alpine populations may be the selection of plans particularly
resistant to physical factors whose intensity increases with altitude
(temperature differential, high intensity of UV and cosmic radiation).
The authors see their future objective in a more detailed study of
radioresistance of A. thaliana and some other plants as a function of
habitat altitude, as well as in a research into the genetic nature of
radioresistance differences in plants.<p>
