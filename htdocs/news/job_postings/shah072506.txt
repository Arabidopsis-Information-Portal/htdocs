Postdoctoral position in Plant Biochemistry and Molecular Biology

 

Kansas State University is seeking a full-time postdoctoral research associates to study plant 
defense response to pathogen and insects.  The research emphasis will be on the identification and 
characterization of function of plant genes associated with defense response, and the involvement of 
lipids and other metabolites in plant defense (Makandar et al. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 19:123-129, 
2006; Shah, J. Annu Rev. Phytopathol. 43: 229-260, 2005;

Pegadaraju et al. Plant Physiol. 139:1927-1934, 2005; Nandi et al.  Plant-Microbe Interact. 18:363-370, 
2005; Nandi et al. Plant Cell 16:465-477, 2004; Nandi et al. Plant Cell 15:2383-2398,2003;  Nandi et al. 
Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 16:588-599, 2003; Shah, J. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 6:365-371, 2003).

 

We seek a candidate with a Ph.D. in biochemistry, molecular biology, plant pathology or a related field.  
Applicants should have expertise in biochemistry and molecular biology.  Candidates with experience 
working in the area of plant defense to pathogen and/or insects are preferred.  The successful candidates 
must be able to independently design and conduct experiments. Excellent oral and written communication 
skills and the ability to work well in a team-based/collaborative research atmosphere are essential.   
Applicants should be available to begin work on the project beginning January 2007.  Screening of 
applications begins September 1, 2006 and will continue until position is filled.



A complete application must consist of 

1) A cover letter detailing your qualifications and how they relate to the advertised position. 

2) A professional resume

3) Reprints/preprints of publications

4) Names and contact information for three referees
