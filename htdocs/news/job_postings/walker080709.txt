Two postdoctoral positions are open in the Walker Lab in the Biology 
Department at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst (see 
http://www.bio.umass.edu/biology/faculty/ewalker.phtml for a brief 
overview). The first position will be to investigate the *Yellow Stripe-Like 
* family of genes in maize.  The second is to perform transcription 
profiling experiments to identify key genes for the production of the 
chemotherapeutic drug taxol.  Each uses a combination of genetics, 
bioinformatics, and biochemistry. 
 
 
 
Applicants with previous plant molecular biology experience are preferred. 
 
 
 
To apply, please send the following materials to ewalker@bio.umass.edu: 
 
 
 
1.  A cover letter explaining specifically why you are interested in joining 
the group, what skills and knowledge you would contribute, and what you 
think we could offer in terms of training.  In addition, please describe 
your career goals. 
 
 
 
2.  A CV with three or more references and their full contact information. 
 
 
 
3.  A brief proposal (a few paragraphs is enough) for a possible project in 
the lab.  This need not be detailed, but should indicate that you have read 
enough of the literature to be sincerely interested in some aspect of our 
research, and that you can think independently and creatively about your 
work.  This can be part of the cover letter.
