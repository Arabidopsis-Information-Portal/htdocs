INTRODUCTION<p>

Pigment mutations of higher plants are widely used as experimental
objects for studying the peculiarities of inherent determination of
plant physiological functions. The genetic collection of various races
and mutant forms of Arabidopsis thaliana set up in the Departmeht of
General Genetics of Cotton, allows to get some new data on the genetic
regulation of the photosynthetic process.<p>

It was aimed by this work to study the laws of the race and mutant
variability of characters at the molecular organization level (the
quantity of the chlorophyll and its distribution in the native forms)
and the photosynthetic activity (reaction centers of the
phytosystems).<p>

MATERIAL AND METHODS<p>

The following races of Arabidopsis thaliana were used as objects of
investigation: Enkheim (En-2), Dijon (Di), Limburg (Li) and Columbia
(Col). The most exhaustive characteristics of the above mentioned
races was reported by Kranz (1978).<p>

A number of pigment and morphological mutants of race En, i.e., mutant
*gamma*-40 (with irregular yellow blots on the surface of the leaves),
8/15, 202/5, V-76 (with yellow-green leaves, 15/1, (with back
orientation of pods on the stem), and of race Col, i.e., mutant vc, er
and vc'er, of which detailed descriptions were given by Redei and
Hirono (1964), were examined in our experiments. The mutant V-76 was
received by Robbelen (see Kranz, 1978) and the mutant 15/1 was kindly
suggested by Yanushkevitch (Faculty of Genetics, Moscow State
University).<p>

All the mutants mentioned, according to our data and references cited
above are controlled by point mutation. The experimental plants were
grown in spring in open air of wooden boxes (30 x 40 cm) filled with
flower soil.<p>

At the budding stage the amount of the chlorophylls a and b in the
rosette leaves was measured by spectrophotometry of extracts
(Wettstein, 1957). The data on the relative concentration of
chlorophyll native forms were received by the decomposition of the
absorption spectra (640-720 nm) of leaves infiltrated by water (for
the decrease of light-scattering) for the constituent bands and by
subsequent calculation methods, suggested by F.F. Litvin and others
(Gulyaev et al., 1973).<p>

For estimating the photosynthetic activity of the reaction centres of
the photosystems, photoinduced changes of absorption at 700 nm
(photosystem I) and the induction of fluorescence (photosystem II)
(Karapetyan, 1974) were measured. The measurements were carried out on
the isolated chloroplasts with use of the one-ray differential
spectrophotometer, constructed on of principles, described by
Verkhoturov and Kononenko, 1974).<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

As it is shown in Table 1, race Col among the races studied has the
maximum chlorophyll content, and in race Di it is minimum. The
broadest range of race variability is characteristic for the
concentration of chlorophyll a. The content of chlorophyll b in the
races studied is more stable. The activity of the photosystem I is
maximum in chloroplasts of race Di, and minimum, in the races Col and
Li. The range of variability of this index reaches about 200%. The
changes of the activity index of photosystem II in the races studied
exceed 300%, from 0.25 (En) up to 0.81 (Col).<p>

chloroplast photosystems in Arabidopsis thaliana.<p>

As the data of Table 2 suggest, mutation of nuclear genes can lead
both to the increase of pigment content in the leaves and in the
majority of cases to the decrease of this index. The changes of the
chlorophyll proportion a to b in the mutants are independent (mutants
of race Col and mutants (*gamma*-40, 51/1, and V-76, race En) or
parallel (mutants 202/5 and 58/15, race En). The activity of the
photosystems resulting from the mutations can be both increased or
decreased, but the range of mutation variability of these indexes, as
a rule, does not exceed the limit of the differences observed in the
ecological races. We observed that the distribution of the chlorophyll
in native forms of Arabidopsis thaliana is similar (Table 3). The
mutations also change these characteristics of the plastidal pigment
apparatus slightly (Table 4). The observed decrease of the comparable
content of the form with the absorption maximum at 650 nm (mutants
202/5 and 58/15) can be explained by the increase of the ratio of the
chlorophylls a to b. These mutants also reveal an increase of the
comparable content of the native forms of chlorophyll a, ch1 671 and
ch1 676.<p>

Appraising the results of the work carried out and comparing them with
the experimental data from the literature, we concluded generally
about the genotypic dependence of variability of the photosynthetic
apparatus (Nasyrov, 1975; Giller, 1982). All the mutants of
Arabidopsis thaliana studied, as mentioned earlier, have the nature of
genic point mutations, for which the location to chromosomal linkage
group is known. The mutations er and 15/1 belong to the linkage group
2, vc and *gamma*-40 to the linkage group 4, and allelic mutations
58/15 and V-76 are at one and the same locus which is localized in the
linkage group 5 (Usmanova and Usmanov, 1983, this volume).<p>

Table 4: The mutant variability of the distribution of native
chlorophyll forms (%) in Arabidopsis thaliana lines.<p>

Here we come across the typical example of the presence of a
heterogenic group (Timofeev-Ressovski and Ivanov, 1966), i.e., the
group with differently located genes, the mutations which control the
different links in the chain of chlorophyll biosynthesis, their
distribution in native forms and the variant activity of reaction
centres of the photosystems. At the same time the mutations studied
have pleiotropic effects of gene action on morphological and
physiological characters of Arabidopsis thaliana. Altogether this
shows the complexity of interactions between genes and characters,
defining the photosynthetic apparatus and the necessity to study the
complex effects of gene action on these characters.<p>
