POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH ASSOCIATE 
PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND PROTEOMICS 

A postdoctoral research associate position is available in the Division of Biology at Kansas State University. 
The successful applicant will investigate the role of steroid lipids in cellulose synthesis by applying 
various systems biology and proteomics technologies in Arabidopsis. The research associate will join a 
multidisciplinary team of scientists, and will have the opportunity for international exchange in our 
collaborating laboratory in Sweden. This project will involve interaction with the Kansas Lipidomics Research 
Center and Biotechnology Core Facility in the Department of Biochemistry. Kansas State University houses 
several interdisciplinary academic programs relevant to the project, such as the Molecular and Cellular 
Developmental Biology Program, the Genetics Interdepartmental Program, and the Evolution and Genomics Program. 
In addition to understanding the fundamental membrane requirements for the function of the cellulose synthase 
complex in higher plants, our laboratory is investigating lipid signaling pathways that act via steroidogenic 
acute regulatory protein-related lipid/sterol transfer (START) domains. For further information, see 
http://www.k-state.edu/schricklab/. 

Minimum requirements include a Ph.D. in biology, biochemistry, chemistry, or related field. The applicant 
must be a citizen or permanent resident of the United States. To apply, provide a cover letter and CV in an 
email message to biology@ksu.edu, using "Schrick position" in the subject line. In addition, arrange for 3 
letters of recommendation to be sent to the same address. Review of applications will begin immediately, and 
will continue until the position is filled. Kansas State University is an equal opportunity employer and 
actively seeks diversity among its employees. Background check required.
