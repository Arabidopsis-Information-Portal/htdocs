In previous publications the isolation of chlorate resistant mutants
of A. thaliana was described (Oostindier-Braaksma and Feenstra, 1973,
1974). In these studies M 2-families were grown on a medium containing
3 meq nitrate and 3 meq ammonium per 1. When seedlings were 6 days old
NaC10 3 was added to medium to a final concentration of 2 mM. This
concentration kills wild type plants.<p>

Contrary to expectation, plants grown on a medium with ammonium as the
sole nitrogen source (3 meq/1) proved to be more sensitive to chlorate
than plants grown on media containing ammonium nitrate. Both wild type
and mutants were sensitive to 2 mM chlorate when grown on ammonium
medium (Oostindier-Braaksma and Feenstra, 1973).<p>

When we exposed wild type seedlings grown on ammonium medium to
different amounts of chlorate, concentrations of 0.09 mM and higher
proved to be lethal. A concentration of 0.09 mM was also lethal for
the nitrate uptake mutant B1. Seedlings of the nitrate reductase
deficient mutant B25 showed retarded growth at 0.3 mM and were killed
by 0.5 mM chlorate.<p>

Doddema and Telkamp (1978) showed the existence of two uptake systems
for nitrate in Arabidopsis. In mutant B1 the second system, operating
at concentrations above 1 mM, is disturbed. The first system, active
up to 0.1 mM nitrate functioned normally in this mutant. It is
conceivable that the absence of a functioning uptake system I would
confer resistance to low concentations of chlorate to the plant.
Therefore, M2-plants were screened for this type of resistance. 170
M2-populations, each population being the progeny of M1-plants and
comprising about 150 seeds were sown. The chlorate (to a final
concentration of 0.1 mM) was added after the plants had grown on
ammonium medium for 6 days. (Mutagenic treatment was as described by
Oostindier-Braaksma and Feenstra, 1973, with 40 mM EMS substituted for
1 mM nitrosoguanidine). In 20 M2-populations apparently resistant
plants were found; altogether 24 such plants were found, among which
were 5 chlorophyll mutants. There were many plants showing clear-cut
resistance and good growth as long as they remained in the petri
dishes in which they had been sown. After transplantation into soil
the great majority of them died, apparently from desiccation. Seeds
could be harvested from 5 plants only, one of which showed a
morphological abnormality (long hypocotyles). Progenies of the 4
normal looking plants were tested for chlorate resistance. Only 2
progenies were homogeneously resistant. Plants from these M3's were
tested for nitrate reductase activity after growth on ammonium nitrate
medium. The activities amounted to 10% (in vitro) and 20% (in vivo) of
the wild type activity and thus were in the same range as those of
mutants, isolated previously on media with nitrate (Braaksma and
Feenstra, manuscript in prep.). Presently it is tested whether the
mutant genes are allelic to genes which are already known to affect
nitrate eductase activity.<p>

As it was considered possible that resistant M 2-plants which died
after transplantation represent an intresting class of mutants it was
tried to devise a culture method which would keep such mutants alive
and allow the harvest of seeds. Growing plants continuously on perlite
in a closed jar did not result in the formation of selfed seeds, but,
in two cases, made it possible to harvest some hybrid seeds after
artificial pollination by wild type. F 1-plants showed normal growth.
F 2's were grown on ammonium medium and subjected to 0.1 mM chlorate.
In both cases about 25% of the plants were chlorate resistant, showing
that the resistance is monogenic and recessive.<p>

Since biochemical tests on plants grown on chlorate containing medium
may be unreliable and comparisons with wild type, grown on this
medium, are impossible, we now use the larger supply of resistant
plants from the F2's to develop a culture method which will result in
the harvest of selfed seeds from the mutants. Moreover, cell cultures
will be started as a means of obtaining larger amounts of plant
material for extraction.<p>
