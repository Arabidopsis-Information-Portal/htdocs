available at the Plant Biology Division of the Samuel Roberts Noble
Foundation beginning early 2012 to work on the N-acylethanolamine (NAE)
signaling pathway in plants. This is a DOE-funded position in collaboration

North Texas. Renewal for a second or third year is contingent on continued
funding by the DOE as well as first year performance. The research involves
understanding the mechanism of NAE action in plant development/stress
responses using biochemical, genetic, cell biological and genomic
approaches. Please see publications regarding our on-going NAE research

using Arabidopsis will be advantageous. The id!
 eal candidate should demonstrate strong communication skills, be
self-motivated, and have the ability to work independently.
