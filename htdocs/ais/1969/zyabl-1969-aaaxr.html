The only purpose of this brief report is to inform Arabidopsis
research workers of our current studies on taxonomic relations within
this genus.  Two different approaches to this problem seem to be
promising: (I) studies on interspecific hybrids, and (II) application
of methods of numerical taxonomy.  These two approaches may provide
independent and complementary information on the taxonomic relations
under question.  By means of the former method some conclusive data
were already obtained by KRIBBEN (1965). Certain advantages of the
latter, at least for the purposes of examination of interstrain
relations, were recently illustated by CROVELLO (1968)<p>

In our studies a comparison of several species of the genus
Arabidopsis, and several subspecies of A. thaliana on the background
of variation between morphological mutations obtained in race Enkheim
is carried out. Five of the nine species found in the USSR (A.
thaliana (L.) HEYNH., A wallichii (J. D. HOOK) BUSCH, A. pumila
(STEPH.) BUSCH, A. griffitiana (BOISS.)  BUSCH, and A. korschinskyi
BOTSCH.) and represented by twelve natural populations from the
North-west and Central regions of the European part of the USSR and
from the Middle Asia are included, as well as five morphological
mutations of the race Enkheim. The degree of similarity of the
studied taxons is estimated on the basis of twenty eight different
quantitative characters specifying the shape of cotyledons, the shape
and number of rosette and stem leaves, the type of leaf margins, the
number of stems, lateral branches, siliques, seeds, etc.<p>

Except for purely taxonomical problems the results of such comparison
may comprise a basis for further population genetical, population
geographical and microevolutionary studies.<p>
