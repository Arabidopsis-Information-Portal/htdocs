A three-year NSF-funded postdoctoral position is available immediately in the 
laboratory of Dr. Jean-Michel Ané (http://agronomy.wisc.edu/symbiosis/) to study 
ion fluxes in response to symbiotic signals using the model legume Medicago 
truncatula. Relationships with changes in the phosphoproteome and the metabolome 
will be investigated.
 
This is a collaborative project of two other laboratories: Dr. Michael Sussman 
(Biotechnology Center - Genetics - Biochemistry, UW Madison); Dr. Joshua Coon 
(Chemistry, UW Madison). The successful candidate will take advantage of the 
collaborative environment between the three research groups.
 
The candidate must have a Ph.D. with some background in electrophysiology and 
calcium imaging as well as basic molecular biology, biochemistry and cell 
biology. Previous experience in a plant system would be appreciated but is not 
essential. The candidate should have strong oral and written communication 
skills in English.
 
If interested, please send (or e-mail) your cover letter, CV, as well as names 
and e-mail address of three references to:
