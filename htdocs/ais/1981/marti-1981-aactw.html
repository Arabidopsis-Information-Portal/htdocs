An examination of seed size distribution in wild type, 2,
4-D-resistant mutant aux-1 (Maher, 1977; Maher and Martindale, 1980;
Martindale and Maher, 1980) and F2 seed populations was undertaken,
after it was noted that mutant seeds appeared to be bigger than those
of the wild type. An attempt was made to quantify this size
difference.<p>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<p>

Initially, only wild type and aux-1 seed samples were examined.<p>

3163 wild type and 5253 mutant seeds were separated by size using a
set of Endecotts test sieves with sieve spacings as follows:<p>

In an attempt to minimise any inter-plant variation seed was collected
from 6 individual plants of each genotype and pooled. Wild type and
mutant plants were grown to maturity over the same period in the
greenhouse and the seed was harvested on the same day.<p>

F2 seed was harvested from 6 F1 plants of the cross (wild type x
aux-1).<p>

RESULTS<p>

Immediately after harvesting, samples of pooled seed were taken using
a small spoon, hence the difference in seed numbers. The seed was then
placed in the top sieve and the tower of sieves was tapped and shaken
for 3 min to ensure good separation. Seeds falling into different size
classes were counted and the distributions were plotted as histograms.<p>

Table 1 shows how many seeds of each genotype fell into the different
size categories.<p>

Table 1: Seed size distribution: wild type and aux-1 populations<p>

Figure 1a (wild type) and 1b (mutant) show the distributions
represented as histograms.<p>

This experiment demonstrated that selfed seed from mutant plants is,
on average, bigger than selfed seed from wild type plants.<p>

and (b) mutant aux-1.<p>

As an extension of this study seed from the different size classes was
sown on 0.75% agar 0.1mM KNO3 and germinated in the growth cabinet.
Root lengths were measured at 72 hours and the distribution plotted.
Figures 2a, b and c show the results for the wild type seed size
classes 250-280 micro m, 212-250 micro m and 200-212 micro m
respectively. This series of histograms shows that bigger seeds
produce seedlings with longer roots after 72 hours in the growth
cabinet confirming the results of Mirza and Maher (1980).<p>

Figures 2 and 3: The distribution of root lengths after 72 hours in
the growth cabinet of seedlings derived from wild type seed from size
classes (2a) 250-280 micro m (2b) 212-250 micro m (2c) 200-212 micro
m, and from mutant aux-1 seed from size classes (3a) 300-355 micro m
(3b) 280-300 micro m (3c) 250-280 micro m.<p>

The same relationship holds for the mutant seed size classes 300-355
micro m, 280-300 micro m and 250-280 micro m as shown in Figures 3a, b
and c respectively.<p>

The only appreciable overlap between genotypes is in seed size class
250-280 micro m. Seedlings derived from this class show considerable
differences in root length between genotypes on plain agar (compare
Figures 2a and 3c). This may result from differences in the
distribution of seed sizes within this size class or from an effect of
genotype on root growth unrelated to seed size.<p>

Figures 4 and 5: The distribution of root lengths after 72 hours in
the growth cabinet on agar plus 0.3 micro m 2, 4-D of seedlings
derived from mutant aux-1 seed from size classes (4a) 300-355 micro m
(4b) 280-300 micro m (4c) 250-280 micro m and from wild type seed from
size classes (5a) 250-280 micro m and (5b) 212-50 micro m.<p>

The effect of seed size on the growth of seedling roots in the
presence of 2, 4-D are shown in Figures 4a, b and c (mutant) and
Figures 5a and b (wild type). Seed from the seed size classes shown
was sown on agar/KNO 3 + 2,4-D (0.3 micro m) and root lengths were
measured after 72 hours in the growth cabinet.<p>

Again, bigger mutant seed produced seedlings with longer roots.
However, both wild type size classes were greatly inhibited.<p>

It is important to note at this stage that dose response data (Maher,
1977) could be confounded if, by chance, small seeds were selected for
control plates and large seeds for the test plates, or vice versa.
However, these major size differences were not noted until after most
of the dose response and growth rate (Mahr and Martindale, 1980)
experiments had been completed. Once it was realised that seed size
played a major role in seedling growth, seed from seed size class
250-280 micro m only was used to represent both wild type and mutant.
This was the size class with sufficient seed of both genotypes for
most experiments.<p>

To test the effect of genotype on seed size, and to complete the seed
size study, it was decided to examine an F2 population of seed,
originating from selfed F1 plants (wild type x mutant). Again, 6 F1
plants were selected, harvested and the seed pooled.<p>

The seed was sieved as for wild type and mutant samples. Table 2 shows
the distribution of seed sizes under the same classification as Table
1.<p>

Figure 6 shows the histogram plotted from the data in Table 2.<p>

This result suggests that seed genotype might be responsible for seed
size. Seed from F1 plant would fall into one of three classes with
regard to resistance to 2, 4-D namely wild type homozygous dominant,
F1-type heterozygotes or mutant homozygous recessive (2, 4-D
resistant) in an expected ratio 1:2:1. Close examination of Figures 6,
1a and 1b suggests that F1 parent plants produce seed representative
of seed size classes of both wild type and mutant.<p>

Figure 7: The distribution of root length after 72 hours in the growth
cabinet on agar plus 0.3 micro M 2, 4-D of seedlings derived from F2
seed from size classes (a) 300-355 (b) 280-300 micro m (c) 250-280
micro m and (d) 212-250 micro m.<p>

F2 seed from different size classes was sown on agar/KNO 3 plates
containing 2, 4-D at a concentration of 0.3 micro M and root lengths
were measured at 72 hours. Figures 7a, b, c, and d show the results
represented as histograms. Table 3 gives the segregations of 2, 4-D
susceptible to 2,4-D resistant seedlings with the relevant *chi*sq. values.<p>

Table 3: F 2 segregations, 2, 4-D susceptible: 2, 4-D resistant for
different F2 seed size classes.<p>

If auxin sensitivity and seed size were pleitropic a preponderance of
aux-1+/aux-1+ genotypes would be expected the smaller size classes
with aux-1/aux-1 genotypes in the larger size classes. Table 3 shows
clearly that this is not the case suggesting that seed genotype does
not govern seed size and that, therefore, the parental (maternal)
genotype may be the main factor in determining the differences in seed
size distributions shown in Figures 1(a), 1(b), and 6.<p>

CONCLUSION<p>

The major point of the value which emerged from these experiments was
the realisation that bigger F2 seed provided a bigger differential
between resistant and susceptible seedling root lengths, after 72
hours on 2, 4-D containing plates, than did smaller F 2 seed samples.
This finding could be of particular value in the identification of
segregating resistant seedlings where a less resistant mutant is
concerned.<p>

Workers using Arabidopsis thaliana as a research tool should be aware
that seed size variation could be a possible source of experimental
error. It is suggested that seed size standardisation would be a
useful procedure in Arabidopsis research.<p>
