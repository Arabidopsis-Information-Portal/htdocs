	Dr. HACCIUS made very intresting observations on chemically induced phenocopies. She successfully reduced the number of several floral parts by phenylboric acid.<p>

	In our laboratory an increase in petal number was occasionally observed.  It is not known which environmental factor has the major role in the induction of polypetaly.  Certain genotypes are specially susceptible to these factors.  In one winter, on mutant an nearly 60% of the flowers displayed polypetaly.  Sometimes not a single abnormal flower is found on the same genotype plants.  The attached picture (taken a few years ago) illustrates the extent of the anomaly.<p>
