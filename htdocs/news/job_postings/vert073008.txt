A 32-month post-doctoral position funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR) is 
available starting January 2009 in the department of Plant Biochemistry and Molecular 
Physiology (BPMP) in Montpellier (France).  
 
We are looking for a highly motivated post-doctoral scientist to study the regulation of a well-
characterized iron transporter in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The project will 
notably focus on the molecular mechanisms driving the trafficking of the protein in the cell, 
with an emphasis on post-translational modifications and on the isolation of interacting 
proteins.  
The successful candidate should be able to work both independently and co-operatively with a 
team, and thrive in a competitive environment. An expertise in molecular genetics, molecular 
biology, biochemistry and cellular biology (confocal live-imaging) is highly recommended. 
He/she must have published articles in top ranking scientific journals. Knowledge of the 
French language is not required. 
 
The BPMP department (http://www.montpellier.inra.fr/ibip/bpmp/english/index.htm) is part 
of the Institute for Integrative Plant Biology located in Montpellier (south of France), one of 
the most attractive city for research scientists in France. Based on experience, salary will start 
from 30,000 €/year (equivalent to $47,000/year) including benefits. 
 
Candidates should rapidly send a brief summary of research experience, a CV, a list of 
publications, and names and e-mail addresses of three referees to Gregory Vert 
(Gregory.Vert@supagro.inra.fr). Review of applications will begin immediately and continue 
until the position is filled.
