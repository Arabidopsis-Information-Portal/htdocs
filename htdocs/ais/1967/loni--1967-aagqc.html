	As reported in a previous paper (BONOTTO, JACOBS, and LEDOUX, 1965) Arabidopsis seeds incubated in the presence of a labelled heterologous DNA (Escherichia coli 3H-DNA) absorbed an amount of radioactivity increasing linearly with the time.  It was observed that the absorbed DNA had a sufficiently high molecular weight to induce eventual biological effects (SCHAEFFER, 1964).  In another paper LONI and BONOTTO (1966) reported a statistically significant inhibition of the growth of primary roots of Arabidopsis following a treatment of seeds with calf thymus or commercial DNA.  In this paper further results are presented on the effect of an heterologous DNA on the growth of the primary roots.<p>

	The seeds of Arabidopsis (Wil-2) were incubated for 42 hours at 24 +/- 1*degree*C in the dark in a 0.01 M NaCl solution containing 2 mg/ml of calf thymus DNA.  The control groups were incubated in a 0.01 M NaCl solution.  The seeds were then washed three times in a 0.01 M NaCl solution and placed on Petri-dishes (cf. MULLER, 1964) for germination at 24 +/- 1*degree*C under constant illumination (Tubes Phytor, 5,000 lux) and in 60% relative humidity. The root length was measured after 5 days.  Under these experimental conditions the maximum root length observed in the control was 25 mm, but only 14 mm in seeds incubated in the heterologous DNA solution; i.e., the mean root length of the treated series was 47.55% as compared to the control.  Moreover, Figure 1 demonstrates that the treatment with DNA induced an important shift of the distribution towards the classes with shorter roots. A statistical test was done on the two groups of roots.  A logarithmic transformation was necessary in order to obtain the homogeneity of the two variances. The analysis of variance of logarithms gave the following result:<p>

	We observed, however, no effect of the DNA treatment on the stem length which appears to be very similar in both the control and treated plants (Figure 2.)  This might be related to the fact that the spical meristem grows very slowly compared to the root meristem (MULLER, 1964) and that, therefore, it could represent a poor material to reveal an eventual early effect of DNA.<p>

	The observed growth inhibition of the primary roots of Arabidopsis could be due to a mutagenic effect of the absorbed DNA (OEHLKERS, 1953).  We cannot, however, exclude the presence of a more complicated mechanism as, for instance, some interaction at the molecular level between the DNA of the plant and the absorbed heterologous DNA.<p>
