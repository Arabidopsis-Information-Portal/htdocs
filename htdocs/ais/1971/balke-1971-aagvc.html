<h2> Does Arabidopsis follow the sun?</h2><p>

Arabidopsis plants of the race Li2 were grown in the greenhouse in
September 1970.  The rosette leaves were radially arranged till they
came into contact with neighbouring pots or plants, and started to be
twisted (see photo).  They were all twisted in the same direction,
independent of the phyllotaxis, as if the stem had been twisted in a
clockwise direction leaving the leaf tips behind.  Illustrations of
twisted mutants (REINHOLZ, 1947) also show a clockwise twist.  This
may be related to the movement of the sun.  In that case plants in the
southern hemisphere should twist anticlockwise.<p>
