<h2> Estimation of induced mutation rate in Arabidopsis</h2><p>

In search for relationships between empirical data on mutant
segregation and the number of mutations induced in embryonic meristem
of autogamous plants, plausible assumptions are required concerning
(a) the mean number of the germ line cells in the embryonic meristem,
(b) the pattern of distribution of mtuations in the initial cells, and
(c) the genetic structure (either chimeric or not) of the gametogenic
tissue of single M1-flowers, within which the selfpollination takes
place.<p>

All the available data indicate that the number of germ line cells (n)
in embryonic meristem of Arabidopsis seeds is more than 1, which makes
possible the chimerism of M1-plants (MULLER, 1965).  Independent
estimations of different authors give n close to 2 (LANGRIDGE, 1958;
LI and REDEI, 1969; NIKOLOV and IVANOV, 1969; IVANOV, 1971; RELICHOVA,
1972).<p>

Single flowers are generally not chimeric, however.  This may be
inferred from the close agreement with the 3:1 expectation of the
segregation in M2 of induced chlorophyll mutations, e.g., among 1783
embryos in mutation bearing pods we found 1368 normal and 415 mutant
embryos, i.e., 3.3:1.  In order to obtain an unbiased estimate of
segregation ratio, only data on pod progenies from M1-plants bearing
single induced mutations were included.<p>

Considering the induced mutations in meristematic cells of
Arabidopsis, it seems reasonable to expect that the distribution of
mutations follows the Poisson series as proposed by A.J. MULLER
(1965).<p>

It is to be pointed out, that a non-chimerical structure of single
flowers is an important additional assumption for the direct
application of the Poisson distribution of induced mutations in M2,
when formulae<p>

m = -ln(1 - mb) and
m = -ln(1 - mc)/f (MULLER, 1965a)<p>

are decuced, where M is the mean number of mutations per initial cell,
ma-frequency of M2 plants with mtuants in the first five siliquae,
mb-grequency of segregating M1 pod-progenies, mc - M2 mutant
frequency, and f - mean frequency of mutants in progeny of
heterozygous (non-chimeric) plants.<p>

Assuming n = 2, it may be found, that M = -ln(1 -ma)/n = -0.5 ln(1 -
ma), where ma is the frequency of segregating M1 plant-progenies.<p>

With overall mutation rate being low, the Poisson mean (M) does not
differ significantly from the frequency of mutuation bearing cells
(m).  Then, instead of the above formulae, the following approximate
relationships may be applied:<p>

The latter relationship is essentially similar to those proposed by J.
LANGRIDGE (1958) and S.L. LI and G.P. REDEI (1969).<p>
