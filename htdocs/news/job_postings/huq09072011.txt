POSTDOCTORAL POSITION AT UT AUSTIN

A postdoctoral fellow position is available for three years to work on the
phytochrome-interacting basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor
(PIF1) that is involved in controlling photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis.
The research involves understanding the mechanism of post-translational
regulation of PIF1 by light using biochemical, genetic and genomic
approaches. Applicants should have a recent Ph.D. in molecular genetics
and/or biochemistry. Prior experience in Arabidopsis is advantageous but not
essential. Salary and benefits will be competitive and commensurate with
experience. Interested applicants should send a CV, brief summary of
research experience, and names and email addresses of at least three
referees preferably by email to huq@mail.utexas.edu
<mailto:huq@mail.utexas.edu> .
