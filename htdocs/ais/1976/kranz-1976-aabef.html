Schemes of in vitro phototransformation and kinetic models of the
phytochrome system presented previously by several authors show:<p>

i) at low temperature the pathways of intraconverstion of Pr and Pfr
involve one initial photoreaction of the chromophore followed by three
dark reactions of the holochrome, and six different intermediates for
both directions;<p>

ii) six phytochrome groups are distinguished, the precursor Pr, the
destroyed Pfr, the inactive Pr, and activated Pfr and two pools of
intermediate Pi connected by different rate constants (Figure 1).<p>

In the following study preliminary results showing certain
photochemical in vivo properties of phytochrome transient forms are
demonstrated in etiolated young and old seedlings of Arabidopsis
thaliana.  Use of certain mutant genotypes, red/far red irradiation
technique at 20+/-1*degree*C, calculation of difference and derivative
spectra, and comparison with certain defects of red induced
photomorphogenesis, allow identification of at least seven transient
forms. The details of our measurement equipment are demonstrated in
Figure 2.<p>

Difference spectra for the reversible photoreaction of the phytochrome
(Pr Pfr intraconversion), repeated two times in sequence) in etiolated
Arabidopsis seedlings of 6 genotypes yield the following: there are
several pronounced peaks in the range of Pr (at 650 to 680 nm) and a
larger number of peaks in the long wavelength absorption of Pfr (at
690 to 750 nm).  Absorption of the first range (Pr) is comparatively
higher than that of the second range (Pfr) after 5' far-red light at
730 nm, and the absorption of these ranges is approximately the
reverse after 5' red light. These difference spectra correspond to the
first reported in vivo difference spectra (BUTLER et al., 1959; KROES,
1970) and leave no doubt that the reversible red/far-red transformable
photochrome system really functions in our material. But this result
is not valid for every genotype studied; e.g., in the genotype ch+
these absorption changes are not realized, and the other genotpes show
deviations to a certain extent. Thus, the distance between the curve
in the red and in the far-red part of the spectrum (corresponding to
the absorption difference) is highest in the genotype ch3 and En2nf1y
and lowest in V81v2 and in ch1.<p>

Table 1: Wavelength (lambda +/- std. dev. lambda) of maxima and minima
in difference spectra of Arabidopsis genotypes after 5 minutes fr-or
r-irradiation as revealed by the zero-transitions of the first
derivative curve.  100 old and young seedlings per sample germinated
for 2 rsp. 1 week(s) in absolute darkness in 10E-3 M GA3 plus 10E-3 M
c-AMP were studied in two experiments (75-8 and 76-3).  In 75-8 six
and in 76-3 four genotypes were included. Deficits of maxima and
minima were indicated by +) for genotype ch+, y) for En2nf1y, 3) v)
for V81v2, 1) for ch1, and 2) for ch2.<p>

If we treat the seedlings with far-red light (5'fr1) for the first
time, high maxima of absorption are produced at 665 and 705 nm (exp.
no. 75-8 in Table 1), and low minima can be shown at 666 and 719 nm in
comparison with the former absorption of etiolated seedlings in the
dark. Further but smaller maxima are produced at 729 nm and additional
minima are demonstrable at 699 nm. This represents the appearance
(maxima) in the r- and fr-spectrum. &#160;Two additional maxima at 675
and 681 are produced belonging evidently to the transformation forms
of chlorophyll as it has been demonstrated with this subject in
previous experiments (KRANZ, l1973).  Treating the seedlings
immediately with 5'r leads to two peaks (maxima at 665 and 696) and
the disappearance of the maximum at 656 nm. The reaction can be
interpreted as demonstrating that P696 is formed in the
phototransformation from P656; this interpretation is in agreement
with the earlier findings of KROES (1970), PRATT and BUTLER (1970)
obtained under quite different conditions.  Phytochrome P696 is a
transient form between the r-and fr-absorbing state of this pigment,
and to that extent it seems to be unstable isomer of Pr (MOHR, 1972).<p>

Peaks of the longwave range corresponds after fr1 and r1 in both
experiments. Furthermore, there are reversions of maxima to minima
(P704, P726-729) and vice versa (P717-719) showing that these pigments
are also transient forms of the phytochrome.  However, in the whole
sample of the 6 genotypes studied their appearance or disappearance is
not exactly correlated with the r- or fr- quality of the actinic light
in the sequence of our experiments. As it is shown by the maximum and
minimum at 726-728 and 730-733 nm, pigment forms of this kind cannot
be transformed in certain mutants. The data presented show that
genotypic defects of this kind are realized only in certain
developmental stages of the seedlings.<p>

Comparison of the difference spectra also demonstrates the differences
between the genotypes studied mainly in the long-wave range of the
spectrum. That accounts for genotypic control of the photoconversions
and/or dark reversions of the Pfr-forms. To examine this hypothesis
more precisely, we have calculated the difference spectra between the
genotypes ch+, ch3, and En2nf1y after 5'r and after 5'fr-actinic light
(figure 3). The curves also indicate that on the whole the Pfr-Pr
transformation of ch+ and En2nf1y is reduced in comparison with ch3.
The data presented account for quantitative differences in the cycling
of the transient forms.  Our results provide evidence for relatively
incomplete phototransformation of the Pfr-and the Pr-forms in the
wildtype ch+, and the longwave transient phytochrome (Pfr) only in its
mutant line En2nf1y compared to ch3.<p>

Now we may discuss the question, what is the normal (standard) and
what is the defective (mutant) pathway of the in vivo phytochrome
transformation in Arabidopsis?  In answering this question we are
confronted to the following problem: defects of the photychrome system
may be both qualitatively and quantitatively controlled by the
genotype and its developmental stage. Cycling of the phytochrome
system and the morphogenetic efficiency of this system are intensified
by mutation in young seedlings of Arabidopsis (e.g., En2nf1y).
Another mutant (ch3) lost the capability of P725-reversion or
destruction in this developmental stage; this Pfr-defect is recovered
in older seedlings. Evidently, the wildtype (ch+) is the most anormal
genotype with respect to the phytochrome system; both pathways between
Pr and Pfr are involved in old as well as in young seedlings.
Consequently, this standard mother line of many radiation- and
chemically induced mutants of Arabidopsis may be the most different
type compared to the classical subjects (mustard, Pisum) in
phytochrome research.<p>

Our preliminary results can be discussed and summarized in the
following conclusion: Six groups of phytochrome were distinguished in
dicotyledonous seedlings as well as grass seedlings, the precursor
group Pr, the destroyed Pfr, and between them two pools of both Pr and
Pfr connected by different rate constants. The most important
differences between grasses and dicots may be the different rate
constants of phytochrome destruction after binding to a pelletable
protein fraction (X0, which seems to be controlled by limiting
(grasses) and non-limiting amounts (dicots) of a "destruction enzyme"
(SCHAFER et al., 1975).  Our present findings, based on studies of the
phytochrome in vivo transformation in young and old Arabidopsis
seedlings, also provide experimental evidence for the existence of 6
to 7 groups of phytochrome. They can now be summarized and discussed
in a tentative scheme (Figure 4).  Furthermore, the figure shows where
the various blocks of the genotypes studied may be localized.<p>

It is generally accepted that P660 and P730 are the basic states of
the phytochrome system, and therefore they are the so called "Pr" and
"Pfr" of the photostationary stage mostly studied (BRIGGS and RICE,
1972). The group of P655-58 and P717-19 are products transformed by
the first far-red (5'fr1) and (5'r1) tratment respectively (Table 1).
Actinic light of 5'r transforms the P655-58 mainly to P696-99;
evidently, the last resembles "lumi-R" of the new terminology recently
published by SPRUIT et al. (1975), as it is additionally conncected
with the loss of "meta-Ra" (P704-10). However, the appearance and
disappearance of P664-67 after 5'fr and 5'r respectively is a new
result not previously published; it provides experimentally
unequivocal evidence for the existance of additional reactions in the
phytochrome system<p>

i) which lead back to the basic state of P655-58 after 5'fr or in the
dark, and<p>

ii) in which the P664-67 can be phototransformed to P704-10 and after
that to P717-19.<p>

Realization of the P664-67 reactions obviously depends on the
developmental stage of the seedlings, since both transformations are
incomplete in young seedlings.  Young material of this kind exhibits
an additional pigment form (P648-52).  Presently, we cannot truely
decide whether P648-52 is the precursor of the phytochrome or of the
chlorophyll.<p>

Figure 4: Proposed scheme of a kinetic model of the phytochrome system
in Arabidopsis seedlings. Assumed genetic blocks are indicated by +
for ch+, 3 for young seedlings of ch3, and V2 for old seedlings of
V81v2.  Abbreviations: hv, photoreaction; X, receptor of the
chromophore.<p>

This fact must always be kept in mind in interpreting the mentioned
results; we are really dealing with a mixture of different forms and
amounts of phytochrome and probably chlorophylls in the difference
spectra demonstrated.  Otherwise, under condition of low irradiation
as it was applied in our experiment, the synthesis and amount of
chlorphyll is very low in the etiolated Arabidopsis seedlings. The
nearly exact reversibility of the peaks in both ranges of the spectrum
after the different r/fr-treatments is a new result.<p>

However, the use of genotypes which differ in photomorphogenesis as
well as phytochrome transformation provides further evidence that the
proposed model is probably correct.  In comparison with En2nf1y, the
"abnormal" wildtype ch+ cannot transform sufficient rates of P698 to
P704-10 after 5'fr1; therefore a smaller amount of P718 is produced in
the experimental sequence. During development this block leads to a
deficit of P656 in old seedlings, since the transformation of P704-10
back to P664-67 is reduced in this genotype.  Otherwise, the mutant
En2nf1y exhibits higher rates of the P696-99-transformation in young
seedlings, and remarkable deficits of P704-10 and P728-33 in old
seedings of V81v2 which inhibits the phototransformations of P655-58
and P664-67, consequently, leading to a deficit of P728-30; in young
seedlings, however, only the P664-67-transformation is involved. This
result accounts for quantitative differences in the cycling of the
seedlings. Further studies will be necessary in order to clarify the
physical and chemical background of these gene-controlled
developmental differences.<p>
