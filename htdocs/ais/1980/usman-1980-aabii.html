In the complex program of studying the biological influence of solar
irradiation the works on clearing up the genetic effects of natural
UV-rays have their particular place. Our task was to investigate
genetic consequences of the influence of UV-rays on pollen seeds of
Arabidopsis thaliana. The experiments were carried out at the Alpine
station of Rui-Dasht, where the level of UV irradiation is 30% more
than above sea level (2500 m above s.l.).<p>

Plants of Arabidopsis thaliana, race Enkheim, were grown in soil
culture. During the period of appearance of buds and flowering, using
the binocular microscope, stamen threads with anthers were extracted
from the buds of certain numbers of maternal plants. As a rule buds
(2-4 per plant) from the basal part of the inflorescence were used. At
the same time unopen flowers from the other plants were picked up.
They served as the source of pollen for performing corresponding
experiments. The flowers were dried in Petri dishes at 24*degrees*C
for 24 hours and then the pollen was shaken out of the anthers and
distributed by monolayer on the glass. Then the pollen was exposed to
UV-irradition of the sun.<p>

The experiments involved 2 variants: with the filter allowing UV-rays
and the filter cutting the UV-rays off. The pollen after the
irradiation was immediately put on to the stigma of pistils. Pods grew
on artificially pollinated plants. On the 9th to 10th day after
pollination embryos of the pods were analyzed according to the method,
described in the study of Usmanov and Muller (1970). In preliminary
experiments we determined upper limits of viability of pollen, exposed
to the UV-irradiation of the sun. It equaled 8-10 hours.<p>

Table 1: Influence of Alpine UV-irradiation on the frequency of
haplophasic and diplophasic dominant embryonal mutations in
Arabidopsis thaliana.<p>

Two series of independent experiments were performed with the
following conditions of UV-irradiation of pollen seeds: 0.5; 2; 3; 4;
5; 6 hours. Exposure was held beginning with 11 a.m. As both
experiments gave similar results, we prersent the results of one of
them.<p>

The Table 1 shows that increasing time of exposure of the pollen leads
to increasing frequencies of haplophasic and diplophasic dominant
lethal mutations. It is discovered, that in the phenotypic spectrum of
the induced mutations sterile mutations were dominant. They were
caused by full inactivation of pollen seeds by UV-rays of the sun
(haplophasic lethals). Then mutations of the type sicca and brevis -
early embryonal lethals blocking the development of the embryo of the
seed on the quadrant and octant stage of development.<p>

Thus, it is discovered that UV-rays of the sun have mutagenic
activity. The question of whether the UV-rays of the sun can induce
recessive embyronal, lethal and chlorophyll mutations will be answered
by carrying out further experiments.<p>
