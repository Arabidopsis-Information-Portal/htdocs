<h2>The influence of gibberellic acid on the germination of irradiated and non-irradiated Arabidopsis seeds</h2><p>

	In No. 3 of this newsletter KUCERA described that Arabidopsis seeds (race ST 56 and BP 4-1 pre-irradiated in an air-dried state with X-ray doses as high as 36 and 72 kR, respectively, showed a significant improvement in germination percentage and germination rate after treatment with cystein, whereas the effect of gibberellin was not equally clear cut.  BP 4-1, the race being more sensitive to radiation, even showed a reduction in its germination ability if the seeds were soaked in a 0.01% solution of gibberellin for 12 hours.  This was found for irradiated series as well as for the non-irradiated controls.<p>

	For this reason some of our results concerning germination responses of Arabidopsis seeds (race Enkheim) after treatment with gibberellic acid may be of interest.  In those experiments gibberellic acid in the whole concentration range tested showed promoting effects; but in no case any evidence for an inhibition of germination was obtained.  Stimulation of germination after treatment with gibberellic acid was also observed by KRIBBEN (1957) in seeds of the bastard A. suecica x A. thaliana requiring after-ripening.<p>

	For the germination, the seeds (at least 500 per series) were kept in Petri-dishes on filterpaper soaked with water and gibberellic acid solutions (MERCK), respectively.  Light and temperature conditions were varied for the different series.<p>

Figure 1:  Day light - room temperature<p>

	As shown in Figure 1a, the curves for the rate of the daily germination, at room temperature (20+/- 2*degrees*C) and during a natural day (June 1966), were lowered when doses as high as 100 to 800 kR were applied.  Treatment with 0.002% aqueous solution of gibrates, however, still lagged significantly behind the controls.  But with a saturated solution of gibberellic acid (0.02%) a germination rate of at least 95% was reached for both irradiated samples and their controls on the sixth day after soaking.<p>

Figure 2:  Continuous light - 16 degrees C <p>

	In continuous light, En-seeds show less germination than in a light-dark change (REINHOLZ, 1947).  Non-irradiated seeds of the above mentioned En samples at 16*degrees*C and 500 lux continuous light (incandescent bulbs) showed a germination rate as low as 57%, while less than 25% germination was recovered after irradiation with doses ranging between 60 and 160 kR.  A 0.002% solution of gibberellic acid improved the germination ability (Figure 2b); with the saturated solution, which proved to be the most efficient concentration, the rates of the daily germination were identically high for both irradiated samples and their controls (Figure 2c).  These data indicate that an inhibition of germination caused by pre-irradiation with X-rays and amplified by continuous illumination can be overcome by an application of gibberellic acid.<p>

Figure 3:  Darkness - room temperature<p>

	Even in complete darkness where non-irradiated En-seeds show a germination rate below 4% (REINHOLZ, 1947 and Figure 3a), the application of gibberellic acid results in the normal germination of non-irradiated and irradiated seed samples.  Gibberellic acid had the same efficiency when applied 20 days after soaking of seeds in water.  48 hours after application germination started with the same rate as if applied at the beginning of soaking.<p>

	The gibberellic acid response of the race Hm, having an obligate light requirement for germination, revealed a quite analogous behaviour.  KRIBBEN (1957) already reported on a promoting effect of gibberellic acid on the germination of non-irradiated seeds of Hm kept in darkness.  With a concentration as low as 0.0001% which was used by KRIBBEN, we found, however, no response.  The concentrations showing good response in our experiments were one to two orders of magnitude higher.<p>
