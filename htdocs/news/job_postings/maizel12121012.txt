The Maizel and Russell groups are looking for a highly motivated 
post-doctoral scientist to study the structural determinant of small RNA 
biogenesis and action in Arabidopsis thaliana. 

Our groups are using a variety of computational, genetics and biochemical 
approaches to address the structural basis of ARGONAUTE protein action. The 
candidate will be appointed in both groups. We seek a scientist able to 
work both independently and co-operatively with a team, and thrive in a 
competitive environment. An expertise in biochemistry, molecular biology 
and computational structural biology would be highly appreciated. He/she 
must have published articles in top ranking scientific journals. 

The groups are part of the Center for Organismal Studies (Maizel) and 
Bioquant (Russell) of the University of Heidelberg which feature a truly 
multidisciplinary environment. 
The position is available from January 2013 and funded for 2 years. 
Applications will be done exclusively by email ( 
alexis.maizel@cos.uni-heidelberg.de). Please enclose in a single PDF file: 
a CV, a list of publications, a brief summary of research experience, and 
names and e-mail of 2-3 referees.
