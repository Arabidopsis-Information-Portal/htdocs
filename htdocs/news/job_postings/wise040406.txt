Postdoctoral Position Available
Iowa State University
Functional Genomics of Plant Disease Defense

A postdoctoral research position is available immediately in the Iowa State University Center for 
Plant Responses to Enviromental Stresses under the direction of Drs. Roger Wise and Steve Whitham.  
The overall goals of the NSF-Plant Genome project "Functional Genomics of Plant Disease Defense 
Pathways" http://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0500461 are to utilize functional 
genomics tools and resources available to barley, rice, and the model dicot Arabidopsis thaliana, 
to accelerate comparative analysis of disease defense pathways important in agriculture.

Candidates will work with a team responsible for molecular, genetic, and functional characterization 
of gene-specific sequences associated with and required for R-gene mediated resistance responses 
using barley powdery mildew as a model system. Approaches include utilization of the 22K Affymetrix 
Barley1 GeneChip to characterize the transcriptional networks regulated during powdery mildew 
induced programmed cell death and subsequent high-throughput reverse genetic systems in barley and 
Arabidopsis to functionally validate candidate genes in resistance pathways of both monocot and 
dicot plants.  All of the above approaches will be facilitated by well-characterized, high-resolution, 
recombinant mapping populations, accelerated cell-death mutants, RNAi and TILLING silencing systems, 
BAC, cosmid, and cDNA library resources.

Funding is available up to three years. Salary is commensurate with experience.  Ph.D. required in 
genetics, molecular biology, plant physiology, plant pathology or related field.  Experience in 
bioinformatics/computational/statistical analysis, single-cell transcript profiling, RNAi mediated 
gene silencing, cell biology, and/or high-throughput gene mapping is desirable.  Highly motivated 
individuals should send curriculum vitae, research interests, and reprints to the address below:
