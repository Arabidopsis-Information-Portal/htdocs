Session 2: Signal Transduction</H1>

<H4>
Chair: Jeff Harper, Scripps Institute, La Jolla, USA</H4>
<B>email:</B> <A HREF="mailto:harper@scripps.edu">harper@scripps.edu</A>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>The session had three themes: Calcium signals, ion channels, and receptor
kinases. The talks all emphasized combining biochemical and genetic approaches
to make Arabidopsis more than just another small genome. The session was
very "mooo..ving".

<P>Janet Braam discussed progress on understanding the role of calcium
binding proteins in the mechano-sensory response in <I>Arabidopsis</I>.
One important direction being pursued is a biochemical understanding of
the potential role of "touch induced" calcium binding proteins in modulating
enzyme activities. Jeff Harper discussed how Calcium-Dependent Protein
Kinases sense and respond to calcium signals. Evidence indicates that they
are activated by a mechanism involving intramolecular binding of the calmodulin-like
regulatory domain -- a model suggesting that CDPKs are fundamentally different
from a typical calmodulin- dependent protein kinases. Zhen Ming Pei, who
discovered a new chloride channel activated by CDPK phosphorylation, presented
his most recent work on patch clamp analysis of ion channels in <I>Arabidopsis</I>
guard cells. This technical achievement, in combination with the analysis
of <I>Arabidopsis</I> mutants, promises to reveal important new insights
into the electrophysiology of guard cell turgor regulation.

<H3>
Six short poster talks followed.</H3>

<H4>
Channels:</H4>
Bern Mueller-Roeber reported on a novel potassium channel that is regulated
by calcium binding to EF-hand motifs present on the same polypeptide.

<P>Bryan Lewis provided electrophysiological evidence that cold shock opens
a calcium channel in the plasma membrane.

<P>Rebecca Hirsch announced the first genetic disruption of a potassium
channel in a higher plant and showed that this channel was important for
potassium uptake by roots.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H4>
Receptor Kinases:</H4>
Zhen-Hui He presented evidence that a Wall Associated Kinase (<I>WAK1</I>)
is essential for plant development and provides a potential signal transduction
link between the cell wall and cytoplasm.

<P>Eileen Maher reported on the use of dSpm transposon tagging to disrupt
TMK, a receptor-like kinase with leucine rich repeats.

<P>Julie Stone reported on progress toward identifying the phosphorylated
sequence in RLK-5 (receptor-like kinase-5) which is recognized by KAPP
(a type 2C protein phosphatase)
