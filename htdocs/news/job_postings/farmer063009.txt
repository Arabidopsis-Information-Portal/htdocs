A postdoctoral position is available for research on the roles of electrical signaling in the wound 
response in the model plant Arabidopsis. The work involves collaboration between the dedicated 
electrophysiology laboratory 
of Stephan Kellenberger (http://www.unil.ch/fbm/page28923_en.html) 
and a laboratory studying the molecular genetics of the wound response in Arabidopsis (Edward 
Farmer; http://www.unil.ch/dbmv/page8006_en.html). The Farmer laboratory has recently found 
extremely fast biochemical responses to wounding that may be initiated by ion fluxes (J. Biol. 
Chem. 283, 16400). We seek someone to conduct electrophysiology experiments on intact plants 
(extra- and intracellular recordings, in some experiments combined with current injection). One 
aim of the project is to test whether electrical activity is critical in the wound response. This 
multidisciplinary project is situated in the vibrant Lausanne biomedical research community. 
Lausanne and nearby Geneva offer a superb lakeside environment. A PhD and published 
experience in electrophysiology is essential. Applications, including the names of three referees 
should be addressed by email to Stephan Kellenberger : E-
