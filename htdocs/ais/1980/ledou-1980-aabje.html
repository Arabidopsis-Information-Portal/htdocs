The metabolism of thiamine has been explored in yeast (Lewis and
Brown, 1961), Neurospora (Eberhart and Tatum, 1963), E. coli (Kayama
and Kawasaki, 1973) and M. denitrificans (Kawasaki et al., 1977).<p>

With these materials it has been shown that a pyrimidine compound ( 2
methyl-4 amino-5 hydroxymethylpyrimidine=HMP) is phosphorylated twice,
then coupled with a oncephosphorylated thiazole derivative into
thiamine monophosphate. In E. coli, thiamine monophosphate is directly
pyrophosphorylated to thiamine pyrophosphate (= cocarboxylase) without
producing free thiamine. Thiamine added exogenously is transformed to
thiamine pyrophosphate by successive steps. In the other organisms,
thiamine monophosphate is first dephosphorylated into free thiamine
which is pyrophosphorylated into cocarboxylase.<p>

To study thiamine biogenesis in Arabidopsis, a thin layer
chromatography method was developed, which allows an efficient
separation of pyrimidine, pyrimidine-P, pyrimidine-PP, thiamine P,
thiamine and thiamine-PP in one step. Pyrimidine phosphates wre
prepared following Leder (1962). M. Winand (I.R.E.) prepared a [3H]HMP
(3 Ci/mol). The other compounds were of commercial origin. Merck
DC-Alufolien Kieselgel 60F 254 was used with a solvent containing:
diethanolamine-methanol-glacial acetic acid water (1:15:1:4).<p>

Groups of 20 sees were sterilized and incubated for 3 days in a
sterile 10E-5M solution of [3H]HMP, then grown on perlite in axenic
conditions, at 22*degrees*C, for different periods of time. After
harvest, plantlets were homogenized with a micro Potter in the
presence of 0.1 N HCl. After deproteinization by chloroform and
centrifugation, the water-soluble compounds (85%-90% of the total
plant radioactivity) were chromatographed together with a mixture of
unlabelled purimidine and thiamine derivatives. After drying, the
plates were examined under UV light to localize the spots. They were
then cut into 0.5 cm strips which were shaken with water, in Packard
vials. The clean aluminim strips were removed. The vials were filled
with a suitable Phosphor and were counted in a Packard liquid
spectrometer.<p>

Results show that most of the [3H]HMP is used for thiamine biogenesis.
Little radioactivity (1-2%) can be found outside the spots
corresponding to the thiamine precursors or derivatives, even after
bidimentional chromatographies made with various solvents.<p>

A kinetic study of uptake and use shows that characteristic
radioactivity profiles are obtained, which describe a stationary state
of distribution. This keeps during the entire vegetative period, while
the proportion of [3H]HMP turned into thiamine linearly increases. The
amount of precursors remains high (&gt;=90%) during the entire period.
When the [3H]HMP supplied varies from 10E-5M to 10E-3M, the obtained
profiles show independency to concentration. This shows that the
conditions correspond to a constant influx of precursors. In such
conditions, all specific ratioactivities should be equal and the
measured ratioactivities should measure the actual concentrations.<p>

When an excess of unlabelled thiamine is added, the radioactivity is
found to accumulate in the thiamine fraction and to drop in the
thiamine-PP, with little change in thiamine-P. This indicates that
thimaine is an intermediate to cocarboxylase, as in Neurospora or
yeast. After feeding the plants with [14C]thiamine, radioactivity
distributions are obtained which parallel those observed after [3H]HMP
feeding. This confirms the existence of a stationary state of
equilibrium between the different related substances participating to
the thiamine metabolism.<p>

Several strains have been studied at 3 temperatures
(16*degrees*-22*degrees*-28*degrees*C) and in different ecological
conditions. We shall deal here with wild type Wilna, 1018-6 (th-2
viable mutant) and th-1 31, tz2 gl2 and py 431 lethal mutants. In
general, temperature has little effect on the observed distributions
even if it affects chlorophyll content and variegations (for 1018-6).
Wild type and HMP-supplemented wit MHT, incorporates the 3H HMP as
well as does the wild type, but presents a different distribution of
the 3H derivatives, characterized by an increased thiamine content.
With th-1 31, very little radioactivity can be found outside the 3H
HMP precursor and the addition of 10E-7 thiamine to the medium does
not improve much the 3H utilization. When treated with 14C-thiamine,
th-1 31 shows distriutions parallel to those of wild type. This
suggests that th-1 31 might lack the possibility to phosphorylate HMP.<p>

When the viable mutant 1018-6 is treated with 3H HMP, the observed
distribution shows no accumulation of the direct phosphorylated
derivatives but a characteristically low thi-PP content (at all
tempertures). No accumulation of thi nor thi-P can however be found
and the more striking difference to the wild type consists in a
general reduction of the 3H found in the three thiamine compounds.
When 14C is supplied, 1018-6 utilized it to produce thi-PP as well as
do wild type, py 431 and th-1 31. It, however, shows an abnormally
high proportion of 14C thi-P.<p>

The effect of an addition of MHT (10E-7 to 10E-4M) was tested at
16*degrees*C. No modification was observed in the 3H distribution
found in 1018-6, while it profoundly affected the distributions in the
other strain tested, where increase thi-PP content was observed.<p>

These results suggest that in 1018-6, the lesion might be in the MHT
section of the thiamine pathway (phosphorylation or coupling to
HMP-PP).<p>

To check further this possibility, M. Winand (I.R.E.) tritiated for us
some MHT. From the extensive study which was done with the ratioactive
compound so produced, it appears that tritiation did unfortunately
modify the molecule of MHT, making it improper for thiamine synthesis.
One the other hand, 14C MHT which we chemically produced by splitting
14C-thiamine was of low specific activity and could not be traced with
a sufficient accuracy in our experimental conditions. More sensitive
methods are presently being tested.<p>
