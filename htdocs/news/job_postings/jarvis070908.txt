Available immediately for 36 months 
 
Ref: R3818 
 
A BBSRC-funded postdoctoral position is available immediately for a strongly motivated 
individual to study the mechanism of chloroplast protein import in the model plant, 
Arabidopsis thaliana. Receptor components of the import machinery have multiple 
isoforms, and previous work indicated that these different isoforms define distinct, client-
specific import pathways. This project aims to define these different pathways in greater 
detail. Experience of molecular biology research will be essential, and experience of 
research on Arabidopsis and/or organelle biology will be highly desirable.
