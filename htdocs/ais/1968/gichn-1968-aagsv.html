Monofunctional HOEMS and MOEMS as well as bifunctional DEPD induce
high frequencies of embryonic and chlorophyll mutations. The high
frequency of mutations induced by DEPD may be caused by the fact that
this compound is not crosslinking but is able to provoke two
independent ethylations.  The mutagenic efficiencies of these
compounds, using mutation rate vs. sterility as a criterion, is
approximately on the same level as that of EMS and much higher than
after the X-ray treatment. The mutagenic effectiveness, using molar
concentration vs. mutation rate as a critrion, is for HOEMS and MOEMS
much lower than for EMS and it is in line with their alyklation rate.
The mutagenic effectiveness of DEPD is lower than the effectiveness of
EMS, although the alkylation rates of DEPD are higher.<p>
