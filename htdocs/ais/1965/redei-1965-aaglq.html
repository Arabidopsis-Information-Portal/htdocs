Vol 01S: <h2>Genetic Basis of an Abnormal Segregation in Arabidopsis</h2><p>

G. P. REDEI<p>

In normal meiosis the chromosomes and genes are faithfully reproduced
and the bivalents segregate at random to opposite poles.  Recognition
of the genetic consequences of this mechanism, unknown at that time,
is a monument to the ingenuity of GREGOR MENDEL. There are numerous
apparent exceptions to the 2nd Mendelian law but most of them do not
violate the priniciple of random chromosome segregation and are
brought about by post meiotic selection. Mechanism which may produce
such an "exception" will be discussed. Part of the experimental
details are given elsewhere (REDEI, 1965).<p>

In an X-rayed family carrying a 2nd linkage group marker, py (REDEI,
1961), an unexpected phenotypic ratio was observed. Selfed
heterozygotes segregated in back-cross like fashion. In some of the
descendants the anomaly reoccurred; from others it disappeared. The
degree of abnormality in the 67 single plant progenies tested was
highly consistent (Probability of the homogeneity test: 0.80). In F2
populations (Gf +/+ py selfed) totaling 11,694 individuals, the
recessive mutant class (5968) significantly exceeded that of the wild
type (5726). Some plants heterozygous for the py marker (Gf py/+ +)
when selfed produced only a few homozygous recessives. It was obvious
that the irradiation produced a "segregation distorter" factor. The
two kinds of abnormal populations reflect the linkage phase of the
"segregation distorter" (Gf) and the recessive marker (py). Gf is
revealed only by the abnormal segregation of second linkage group
markers (Table 1). A four point cross + er as su/Gf + + + produced the
following ratios of the linked recessive markers in the F2: +/er -
0.85; +/as - 1.3; =/su - 1.5 indicating that er is the closest to Gf
on the chromosome.<p>

Since chromosomal aberrations are the most common cause of abnormal
marker segregation and affect primarily the male in plants, 188 plants
from 5 abnormal families were examined for microgametophytic viability
by acetocarmin staining. Less than 1% of the pollen was abortive
(Table 2).<p>

The silique fertility of both normal (+ +/+ py) and abnormal (Gf +/+
py) heterozygotes was determined (Table 3). Normal plants contained an
average of 34.4 seeds per silique, Gf carriers only 21.3 or 61.9% of
normal. Seed germination in the abnormal families was slightly higher
but the difference was not significant. Thus the results of the seed
abortion count reflect correctly the female fertility.<p>

Male tansmission of the Gf strand was determined with appropriately
marked female testers (+as/+as [female] x Gf+/++ [male]). The second
generation provided the required information. In all, 520 chromosomes
of the male gametophyte were studied. Only 166 Gf gametes were
successful in fertilization instead of the expected 260 (the pollen
did not appear abortive by staining). It appears that the non Gf
pollen had a selection coefficient larger than 2. A very small
experiment gave some indication that recombination between Gf and
linked markers take place in the male with normal frequency (Table
4).<p>

Female transmission was determined by the following test-cross: (+ py
+/Gf + +*female* x (+ + as) *male*. The genetic constitution of the
386 chromosomes of the female was ascertained by a subsequent serfing.
No Gf strand came through the egg. Its transmission could be easily
detected since it has good expression and is sufficiently close to Gf
to appear in considerable excess of 25% in the presence of the
"segregation distorter". In F2 populations carrying as and Gf the
frequency of as homozygotes was around 40% (cf.  Table 1 second group
from the top).  There is only 0.0001 probability that the Gf factor
would be transmitted through the female in 1%. This is in sharp
contrast to the relatively good male transmission of 32%.  This is a
36% reduction from the maximal 50%.<p>

Another unexpected effect of the Gf factor was revealed by the
transmission tests. The recombination value between Gf and py was 25.5
+/- 2.7 in the male; in the female only 16.0 =/- 1.0% exchange was
observed in the same region. The significance of the difference is
well established (P = 0.01).<p>

With this genetic information in hand, an attempt to determine the
mechanism involved may be undertaken.<p>

Distorted segregation in plants is commonly brought about by
gametophyte factors which lower the transmission of the affected
chromosomes or sometimes eliminate certain gametic classes. Male
gametophyte factors were located on nearly every chromosome of maize
(cf. COE, 1962). It is likely that certation (pollen competition) is
also involved in the low male transmission of Gf since pollen abortion
was not observed. This type of selection can not account, however, for
some other observations. In maize, the genetically best analyzed
higher plant, only one female gametophyte factor has been studied
(SINGLETON, 1932). Gf is similar to this "lethal ovule" factor in that
both are transmissible only through the male. A "lethal gene
interpretation" might explain the anomalous marker ratios observed but
would be obviously incorrect in view of the seed set data. Assuming
random chromosome segregation in meiosis and regular megasporogenesis
the maximal fertility of abnormal plants (which do not transmit one of
the homologues) can not exceed 50% of that of the normal genotypes.
Experimentally, however, 62% fertility was observed. The difference is
significant beyond the 0.001 probability level.<p>

The anomalous segregation of linked markers and the higher than 50%
seed set in the absence of female transmission of one particular
chromosome could be caused by megaspore competition (cf.  RENNER,
1921).  Megaspore competition can not be responsible for the
difference in crossing over between the female and male sporocytes
(Figure 1). There is also direct embryological evidence against
megaspore competition. In all the ovules sectioned only one, the
chalazal megaspore, appeared functional (Figure 2).<p>

The lower recombination value detected in the female and the
relatively high egg viability could be caused by a longer inversion.
Crossing over in the inverted segment may result in bridges (cf.
Figure 3). The dicentic deficiency chromosomes because of the "tie" at
anaphase I may have difficulties entering the two outside nuclei, and
may be retained in the two middle cells of the linear tetrad (cf.
BEADIS and STURTEVANT, 1935). This mechanism would not account for the
lack of transmission of one chromosome.<p>

Furthermore recombinants should be rare also in the offspring of the
abnormal pollen parent, which is not the case (Table 4). Thus the Gf
effect can not be attributed to an inversion.<p>

presence of a lethal factor. Only one parental chromosome and only
half of the cross overs are transmitted. Female fertility may reach
e.g., 60%.<p>

Figure 3: An anaphase I bridge in inversion heterozygoes may keep the
cross over strands tied and should result in nearly normal female
fertility and low recombination frequency. Only non-cross over
chromosomes are expected to segregate to the basal pole.<p>

Partial sterility is commonly caused by reciprocal translocations.
The frequency of alternate distribution may control the degree of
sterility in both female and male. Alternate disjunction is expected
to perpetuate the rearrangement also through the female. A
non-reciprocal translocation or a duplication or a deficiency might be
responsible for part of the observations if the chromosomal
aberrations are involved in preferential segregation. Chromosomal
aberrations are not very likely to be involved since these are
deleterious primarily to the male gametophyte.<p>

The Gf factor may pleiotropically control meiotic or post-meiotic
selection.<p>

Preferential segregation of heteromorphic bivalents is detectable
cytologically in maize and results in abnormal transmission of genetic
markers through the female (cf. RHOADES, 1952).  Preferential
segregation might well explain the higher than 50% seed set in the
absence of transmission of one of the homologous chromosomes. It may
perhaps modify the frequency of recombination in the megasporocytes.
In maize the knobbed chromosomes are pulled to the poles ahead of the
rest of the complement because of the neocentromeric activity. If, in
such a material, the diakinesis would be initiated precociously a
reduction of recombination may result. In maize, preferential
segregation does not appear to affect crossing over, however
Cytological information concerning preferential segregation is not
available in Arabidopsis. It would be very difficult to ascertain such
a mechanism because of the small size of the chromosomes and the lack
of appropriate cytological markers. There is no evidence available
which would rule out preferential segregation as a basis of the
apparently non-mendelian segregation.<p>

The observed anomaly may be brought about by a different mechanism,
postmeiotic selection. The studies of ovules collected from
populations segregating abnormally demonstrated the presence of twin
megasporocytes (Figure 4). If chromosome segregation is random and
only one of the twin sporocytes produce a functional megaspore, an
opportunity is provided for selection (KAPPERT, 1935). The selection
may take place between the haploid secondary sporocytes derived from
twin megaspore mother cells or between the chalazal megaspores of the
reversely oriented tetrads. This mechanism can produce more than 50%
seed set even if one of the strands is never transmitted through the
female (Figure 5).<p>

tetrads.  Selection may take place either at B or C stage and increase
seed set above 50%.<p>

Only speculations are possible on the cause of the unequality of the
recombination frequency in the two sexes. In several animal species
crossing over is suppressed in the heterogametic sex. In the male
Drosphila (MORGAN, 1912) or in the female Bombyx TANAKA, 1915) there
is no normal recombination. In the dioecious Melandrium, however, even
the sex chromosomes may recombine (WINGE, 1931). In monoecious plants
the recombination frequency generally is not modified by sex; if a
difference was found, the lower crossing over values occurred in the
female (GREGORY, DE WINTON and BATESON, 1923; STADLER, 1926; RHOADES,
1941). It is conceivable that pachytene pairing is either less
intimate in the megaspore other cell than in male sporocyte or
diakinesis is precocious, thus either space or time or both may hinder
crossing over.  Another possibility is that there is meiotic selection
against crossover strands in the linear tetrad.  If the
terminalization of certain chiasmata is tardy, synaptic forces may
keep the exchange strands close to the equatorial plate even at the
beginning of enaphase I. Thus even in the second division the exhange
strand has a somewhat reduced chance to be pulled to the basal pole.
Perhaps in the female an exchange between Gf and the centromere
interferes with a second exchange betwen Gf and py.<p>

Summarizing the discussion: an unusual female gametophyte factor
failed to transmit through the eggs, and in apparent violation of the
2nd Mendelian law, the seed set was in excess of the expected maximum,
50%. In the light of the available information the phenomenon may be
interpreted as the result of (1) preferential chromosome segregation
in the two meiotic divisions or (2) post-reductional selection of
secondary sporocytes or of basal megaspores developed from twin
megaspore mother cells. Cytological evidence in support of hypothesis
(1) is not available. Embryological information favors hypothesis (2).<p>

Discussion:<p>

ROBBELEN: Do you have any estimate how frequent these events are?<p>

REDEI: I don't have any accurate estimates, because the gametophyte
factor doesn't have any phenotype, except segregation distortion. I
just used a material which was supposed to contain a relatively high
number of the special class which I selected on the basis of the
genetic markers. I did not fix the buds from single plants separately.<p>

ROBBELEN: May I ask for the method: Did you do any orientation of the
silique while sectioning? The difficulty in cutting these ovules is,
that they are turned aside by the septum in an undefinite manner, so
it is by chance that you cut them median.<p>

REDEI: Yes, I'm sure, half of them are lost. I use paraffin sections,
fixed in Allen B 15 and stained by HEIDENHAINs Haematoxylin.<p>

FEENSTRA: You mentioned recombination data. Does the Gf factor
interfere with crossing over?<p>

REDEI: Markers in coupling with Gf are detected in reduced frequency,
while those markers which are in repulsion appear in excess.  In the
male and female there is a differential recombination between Gf and
py. I do not know how much it modifies recombination in general
Apparently it modifies recombination in some other regions too: it
suppresses in certain regions and increases in some other regions.<p>

KRANZ: What do you say about your scheme of chromosome bridges and the
fact that an inversion might be involved? Is there any chance to see
inversions?<p>

REDEI: You cannot see most aberrations; but inversions, of any
considerable size, would form bridges which certainly would be
detected.  Dr. Lotti SEARS actually found some inversions in
Arabidopsis; the bridges were clear.<p>

ROBBELEN: Only to mention: the technic that Dr. SEARS has elaborated
is very efficient indeed. The pictures you get when using additional
phase contrast microscopy are very clear.<p>
