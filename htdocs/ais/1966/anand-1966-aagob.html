	Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana were germinated aseptically in petri-dishes to be transferred directly into different culture media.  The seeds were sterilized with 5% Chlorox, washed twice with sterile double distilled water, and then transferred into sterile autoclaved petri-dishes containing three layers of filter paper soaked with sterile water.  The dishes were wrapped with rubber petri-dish seals and kept at 4*degrees*C for 48 hours.  They were then placed in a culture room kept at a constant temperature of 27+/- 1*degree*C, with a 16 hour photoperiod.  The light source was cool white flourescent tubes with a light intensity of 350 ft-c. at the petri-dish level.  Under these conditions seeds germinated after 48 hours.  A variety of media both solid and liquid containing various growth hormones were used in an attempt to obtain callus growth of the seedlings.  WHITE's medium (WHITE, 1943, here abbreviated as W), supplemented with coconut milk (DM) and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), was found to callus the seedlings.  The resultant growth of the callus yielded free clusters of cells.<p>

	Next optimum concentrations of CMN and 2, 4-D, for maximum callus growth were sought.  Combinations of CM at 10%, 15%, and 20% with 2,4-D at 10E-4M, 10E-5M, 10E-6M and 10E-7M were tried.  A measure of the increase in fresh and dry weight of the callus after three weeks growth showed 2, 4-D at 10E-6 and CM at 15% concentrations to be best.  Also liquid medium supported greater growth than the solid.  125 ml flasks containing 50 ml of the medium shaken at 130 rotations per minute yielded only a nonfriable type of tissue.  These callus clusters contain modified cells like tracheids and cells rich in starch grains, in addition to parenchymatous cells.<p>

	Interesting results were obtained with 10E-7M 2,4-D and 15% CM.  In this liquid medium the callus produced a large number of root primordia over the entire tissue surface.  In the course of two weeks these primordia grew out as roots, and after two months of growth their length had increased tremendously.  This observation is of particular interest since TORREY and SHIGEMURA (1957) reported previously that 2, 4-D suppresses organisation of roots.<p>

	For histological study differentiating root primordia were fixed in formalin-acetic acid-alcohol (FAA) and dehydrated through butanol-ethanol-water series, embedded in paraplast and sectioned at 8 microns  Sections were stained with safranin fast-green.  Examination of these slides revealed that the roots originated from a row or two of thin-walled cambial-like cells which were located between tracheidal cells within and parenchymatous cells rich in starch outside.  Further study is being pursued and should elucidate the sequential development of roots from this unorganized mass.<p>

	Recent reports show that modified MURASHIGE and SKOOG-medium induced Arabidopsis thaliana callus to form roots and shoots (YOKOYAMA and Jones, 1965).  However, I have been unable to obtain shoots in MURASHIGE and SKOOG-medium with kinetin and IAA in different combinations. Roots developed profusely from the undifferentiated callus with IAA 10E-6M and kinetin 2 x 10E-8M, 10E-7M, 2 x 10E-6M, and 10E-5M.  These roots, however, differ from the ones obtained with CM and 2, 4-D in that they do not show root hair elongation although small hair initials are seen.<p>

	Subsequent work should throw more light on the nature and cause of these roots, which seem to be a unique feature of this tissue.<p>
