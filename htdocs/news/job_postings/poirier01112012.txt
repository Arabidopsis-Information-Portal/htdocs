Postdoc and PhD positions on phosphate transport and homeostasis 
Department of Plant Molecular Biology 
University of Lausanne, Switzerland 

A postdoctoral and a PhD position are available 
in the laboratory of Yves Poirier at the 
Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University 
of Lausanne. These positions are available April 
1, 2012 or soon thereafter. The research projects 
are centered towards the understanding of the 
mode of action of the PHO1 gene and of its 
homologues in phosphate transport, phosphate 
homeostasis and the adaptation of plants to 
phosphate deficiency. The projects involve the 
application of genetics, molecular and cell 
biology. Further details about the laboratory can
