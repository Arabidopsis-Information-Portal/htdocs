Postdoctoral Position, Indiana University, Bloomington

Biochemistry, Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics of Plant-Pathogen
Interactions

Two postdoctoral positions are available in the laboratory of Roger Innes to
study the molecular mechanisms that mediate disease resistance in plants.

These positions are funded by two different NIH grants. The first focuses
on the RPS5 disease resistance protein of Arabidopsis, which mediates
detection of the AvrPphB protein from Pseudomonas syringae. RPS5 belongs to
the NBS-LRR superfamily of resistance proteins. Current questions under
investigation are how RPS5 is activated and, once activated, how RPS5
triggers plant defense responses. The second project focuses on the
regulation of programmed cell death during pathogen infections, with an
emphasis on understanding endomembrane trafficking and possible links to
autophagy. Additional information about these projects and the Innes
Laboratory, including publications, can be found at
