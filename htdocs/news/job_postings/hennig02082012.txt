Postdoctoral position in epigenetic control of development 



A position for a full-time postdoctoral researcher is available in the 
laboratory of Prof. Lars Hennig at the Department of Plant Biology and 
Forest Genetics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences ( 
www.vbsg.slu.se&lt;http://www.vbsg.slu.se&gt;). 



A multidisciplinary approach using a combination of molecular, cell 
biology, biochemistry and genomics methods will be developed to study 
Polycomb Group proteins and regulation of flowering time. 



We are looking for a highly motivated candidate with a PhD degree, a strong 
background in plant biology, molecular biology or biochemistry, and a good 
record of peer-reviewed publications. Excellent writing and oral 
communication skills are essential. 

Previous experience in epigenetics and genomics is a plus, but not a formal 
requirement. 



The laboratory is based in Uppsala, Sweden's fourth largest city. Uppsala 
has two universities with together ~40'000 students and is less than an 
hour away from Stockholm, the Venice-of-the-North. Stockholm international 
airport is also close by, 20 minutes by train from Uppsala, and has 
frequent connections to the rest of Europe as well as to other continents. 



Applications, including (1) CV with full publication list, (2) a 
description of research experiences, (3) a statement of scientific 
interests as well as (4) contact information of three referees should be 
submitted by e-mail as a single pdf file to Lars.Hennig@slu.se. Reviews of 
applications will begin immediately and the position will remain open until 
filled.
