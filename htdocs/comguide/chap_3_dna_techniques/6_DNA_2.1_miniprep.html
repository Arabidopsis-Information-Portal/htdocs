*  The original maize DNA miniprep protocol (version 1) and its 
successor, version 2, is used quite extensively for many plant species 
and different tissues.  We prefer this slightly modified version (2.1) for 
most DNA extractions.  This procedure has the advantage of speed, its 
use of inexpensive reagents and its environmental soundness since no 
phenol or chloroform waste is generated.

1.  MATERIALS
  (i) EXTRACTION BUFFER (EB)
50mM Tris, pH 8
10mM EDTA, pH 8
100mM sodium chloride
1% SDS
10mM beta-mercaptoethanol

liquid N2
3M potassium acetate
isopropanol
80% ethanol
3M sodium acetate
Miracloth (Calbiochem 475855) filters cut about 4 cm2
Falcon 2059 tubes or equivalent
Corning 8441 centrifuge adaptors cut 3/4 length
1.5 ml microfuge tubes
mortar and pestles
powder funnel (15 mm stem)
65oC temperature block or water bath

2.  METHOD (Miniprep)
  (i) Dispense 7 ml EB in Falcon 2059 tubes for the number of minipreps 
required. 
  (ii) Place 0.5-2 g (1 g is ideal) of plant tissue in mortar and add an excess 
of liquid nitrogen.  When the nitrogen evaporates, grind the tissue 
thoroughly into a fine powder.
  (iii) Transfer the powdered tissue from the mortar into the Falcon tube 
containing EB solution.  (This can easily be done using a metal spatula 
and powder funnel whose stem fits snugly into the Falcon tube.)  
Quickly mix the powdered tissue and EB with the spatula.  
  (iv)  Cap the tube, shake vigorously, and incubate at 65oC while the 
next tissue is ground and extracted.  
  (v) After all the tubes have incubated at 65oC for at least 5 min, add 2.5 
ml of 5 M potassium acetate.  Cap, shake vigorously, and incubate tubes 
on ice for at least 15 min.
  (vi) Spin the tubes at 8,000xg at 4oC for 10 min.
 *  The Falcon tubes can be centrifuged in fixed angle rotor (e.g., JA-17 
or equivalent) using  rubber adapters (e.g., Corning 8441) that are cut 
3/4 their length to accommodate the Falcon  tube and cap.  Alternatively, 
the tubes can be spun in a swinging bucket rotor.

  (vii) With a 5 ml pipette, carefully remove the supernatant and filter 
through Miracloth into a Falcon tube containing 5 ml isopropanol.  This is 
done by forming a Miracloth funnel by pressing the center of the square 
into the Falcon tube with the pipette tip.  Slowly filter the supernatant 
through the Miracloth funnel.
  (viii) Cap the tubes and invert several times to precipitate the DNA.  Spin 
the tubes at 8,000xg to pellet DNA.  (see Note (i)) 
  (ix) Rinse the pellet with 80% ethanol and if necessary respin to pellet 
the DNA.  Air dry the pellet by inverting the tubes on paper towels for 
several minutes then redissolve DNA in 500 ul TE (10mM Tris, pH 8; 
1mM EDTA).  Transfer the DNA solution to a microfuge tube.  
  (x)  Reprecipitate the DNA with 50 ul 3M sodium acetate and 500 ul 
isopropanol.  Pellet the DNA by brief (30 sec) centrifugation in the 
microfuge, wash the pellet with 80% ethanol and redissolve in 200-300 
ul TE.
  (xi) Before using the DNA for restriction or PCR analysis, spin the DNA 
solution for 5 min in the microfuge to pellet insoluble materials.

3.  NOTES
  (i)  An even quicker version (2.2) of the above procedure can be done 
when the DNA forms a single clump after the first precipitation, which it 
usually does.  Remove the DNA from the Falcon tubes with a glass hook 
(made by flaming the end of a Pasteur pipette) before the pelleting step.  
While the DNA is still on the hook, carefully rinsed with 80% ethanol from 
a squirt bottle and transfer directly into the microfuge tube.  (The glass 
hooks can be reused by cleaning and sterilisation.).  This DNA air dried 
and redissolved in 200-300 ul TE and used directly for restriction or PCR 
analysis.
  (ii) For restriction analysis, 7 ul of miniprep DNA (approx 3 ug) is 
adequate for single copy Southern analysis.  Include DNase-free RNase 
in the restriction reaction to remove residual RNA.
  (iii) For PCR analysis, 1-2 ul of miniprep DNA is sufficient to amplify 
single copy genomic sequences.  Occasionally, inhibitors of the PCR 
reactions are present in some DNA minipreps from some species.  
These inhibitors can be removed by including PVP in the extraction 
buffer (Jychian Chen, pers. comm.) or by passing the final miniprep DNA 
sample through a spin dialysis column (Sepharose CL-6B) before PCR 
analysis.
  (iv) For genomic cloning, further purification of miniprep DNA is 
sometimes necessary for maximum ligation and packaging efficiencies.  
Size fractionation by glycerol gradient centrifugation or by gel 
electrophoresis gives DNA that ligates and packages extremely well.  
Recombinant lambda libraries (>106 recombinants per ug DNA) are 
routinely obtained using size fractionated miniprep DNA.
  (v) For critical work such as PCR and cloning, mortars and pestles are 
best used a single time then soaked in a dilute bleach solution 
immediately after use until cleaning.  After cleaning and thorough rinsing 
cover the mortar and pestle with aluminum foil and bake to sterilise.  For 
standard Southern analysis, the same mortar and pestle can be reused 
several times to grind multiple tissue samples by carefully wiping the 
surfaces clean between samples.  Falcon tubes can also be reused for 
non-critical work.

4.  MICROPREP version 2.3
 *  A scaled down version of the miniprep (microprep) can be performed 
entirely in microfuge  tubes very efficiently.  

  (i) *This procedure requires a hand-drill or better yet a table-top drill-
press.  Connect a microfuge pestle (Kontes Sci., Vineland, NJ; item 
number 749520) to the drill.  Place a small amount of leaf tissue directly 
in a microfuge tube.  Add liquid N2 to freeze and when the N2 
evaporates, quickly grind the pulverise the tissue to a fine powder.  Have 
a squirt bottle of EB ready and add EB to the tissue to bring the volume 
to about 750 ul.  I do this while rinsing off the pestle.  Vortex to suspend 
tissue in buffer.  Incubate at 65oC for 10 min.  Add 200 ul 5M potassium 
acetate, vortex briefly and incubate for 20 min on ice.  Spin in the 
microfuge for 10 min, transfer to a new microfuge tube and precipate 
DNA with an equal volume of isopropanol.  Immediately spin out 
genomic DNA for 2 min in microfuge, wash with 80% ethanol and respin 
if necessary.  Dry pellets and redissolve in 50 ul TE.  I recommend 
passing the DNA through CL-6B spin columns before PCR.  Restriction 
digest and Southerns can be done immediately 1/10 volume of 40 mM
