Vol 01S: <h2>Isolation of Biochemical Mutants in Arabidopsis</h2><p>

M. JACOBS<p>

The different mutants recovered in flowering plants can be
conveniently classified into three groups: 1) morphological mutants,
2) pigment mutants (including chlorophyll and carotenid deficiencies
and pigment changes in flowers and seed coat), and 3) physiological
mutants (concerning essentially growth rate, flowering time,
resistance to ecological factors or various diseases). Among these
types of mutants some are lethal and die before maturity.<p>

In these mutants of higher plants biochemical analysis generally
proved difficult due to complex genetic system of the organism with a
longer generation time. So, opposed to many results obtained with
bacteria, algae or fungi, there are relatively few examples of mutants
that have been found to control metabolic defects in higher plants.
These examples include the findings on the thiamine deficiency in
tomato (LANGIDGE and BROCK, 1961) accumulation of some compounds such
as tryptophan, nicotinic acid and lysine in endosperm mutants of maize
TEAS and NEWTON, 1951; MERTZ, BATES and NELSON, 1964), recovery of
cetain chlorophyll deficiencies with aspartic acid and leucine in
barley (WALLES, 1963), examination of biosynthesis of the authocyanes
in Antirrhinum and of the alkaloid tomatin in tomati (STUBBE, 1959),
and various gibberellins deficiencies in peas, barley and maize
(PELTON, 1964).<p>

In Arabidopsis, which is a very convenient material for this type of
study, LANGRIDGE (1958) described a number of lethal and semi-lethal
mutants which appeared in the absence of thiamine, choline or more
complex requirements. FEENSTRA (1964) and REDEI (1962) also obtained
thiamineless mutants and REDEI (1963) reported about a cysteine-
sensitive mutant.<p>

The purpose of the present paper is to report three methods which have
been used in the biosynthetical study of Arabidopsis.  Modifications
of LANGRIDGE's culture media (LANGRIDGE, 1957), substrate type,
culturing conditions have been reported in the first issue of
Arabidopsis Information Service (JACOBS, 1964).<p>

The "rescue" method for obtaining nutritionally deficient mutants is
presented in Table 1. In this case, screening is based upon the fact
that the mutant plants exhibit a better growth or/and a more standard
growth habit on supplemented media than on the minimal medium.<p>

Another related procedure consists of limiting the number of
metabolites of complete medium. By this manner, it is possible,
immediately after second generation to test the plants on singly
supplemented media. Substances involved are: two bases: adenine and
uracil, four vitamins: nicotinic acid, thiamine, inositol and
paraminobenzoid acid, and four aminoacids: arginine, histidine,
methionine and tryptophan. another way of obtaining mutants is the
"total isolation" method in which treated seeds are directly sown on
complete medium. By this manner, the possibility of obtaining larger
spectrum of mutants and to avoid selection against nutritional
heterozygotes is expected.<p>

of Arabidopsis thaliana (L) HEYNH.<p>

Secondly, the method termed as "delayed rescue method" deals with
chlorophyll and morphological mutants previously obtained.  Bearing in
mind that inheritable chlorophyll or morphological defects are the
phenotypic expression of physiological processes under gene control,
we set out to test such mutants. Chlorophyll mutants are grown either
on minimal medium, on minimal medium supplemented with thiamine and on
complete medium. Morphological mutants are tested on minimum and
complete medium. Potential responses to a particular medium are
recognized by measurement of growth and from the habit, flowering time
and fertility of plant. Single supplemented media are then performed
according to the need.<p>

In the third method, named "anticipation method" analysis of monogenic
morphological mutants for their content in amino acids is made. In
fact, some examples of relationships between morphological characters
and relative amino acids amounts have been reported in tomato (MATHAN
and COLE, 1964) and in barley (SARKISSIAN, SHAH and STEBBINS, 1962;
WIJEWANTHA and STEBBINS, 1964). Comparisons between free amino acid
content of wild types and mutants could indicate the kind of
supplement that should be tested.<p>

Table 2: Illustration of "rescue method"<p>

Preliminary results obtained with rescue method are presented in Table
2. Out of ten chlorophyll mutants tested with "delayed rescue method",
one has been proved to be thiamineless. For the mutants mentioned,
confirmation of the requirement, study of the growth in relation to
the concentration of required metabolite, and crossing programmes are
now underway.<p>

In microorganisms biochemical mutants proved to be invaluable in the
elucidation of biochemical pathway and gene fine structure, or as
genetical markers and tools in bioassays. Obviously, Arabidopsis
provides good opportunity to study these processes just so in a
flowering plant. It would also be necessary to look for mutants which
are useful to elucidate problems specific for higher plants and solve
some of the questions arising during the early developmental processes
"sensu lato". The partially "leaky" or "laggard" mutants having a
reduced growth in minimal medium, are often discarded in
microorganisms, but they look like useful tools in the study of gene
action in higher organisms. The change of enzyme activities in these
mutants may be a link in a chain of events leading from the gene to
the trait.<p>

Discussion:<p>

FEENSTRA: You told us that with your rescue method you supplemented
your medium with organic compounds after 2, 4 and 6 days.  My question
is, in what stage are your plants then? When we grow them in a similar
way we hardly can see the first normal leaves after the cotyledones. I
wonder whether in this stage you can make the distinction between
normal and abnormal growth.<p>

JACOBS: I make the selection at cotyledon stage when the first leaves
begin to develop, considering growth rate, coloration and relative
development. Some seedlings look very leaky at this stage.<p>

FEENSTRA: You supply your compounds at a rather early stage.  Have you
any idea about the period of starvation these mutants (not the
thiamine mutants) can stand? When you add organic compounds later than
6 days, can the mutants then still recover or do they die?<p>

JACOBS: That depends essentially what kind of mutant is considered. If
a chlorophyll mutant is not very depressed it is possible to keep it
on minimum medium more than six days. with other mutants such as
methioninless it is impossible to get them after the cotyledon stage.<p>

FEENSTRA: I asked this question because we used, as you know, the same
method; only we did the selection between normal and abnormal at a
later stage, that is at 8 days. At that stage you can see the first
normal leaves. But we found up to now only 15 mutants which react to
thiamine. Maybe that we waited too long; but on the other hand we were
afraid to lose too many mutants. So we selected at this stage, because
earlier we can't make distinctions between normal and abnormal.<p>

REDEI: What is the fertility of these mutants you mentioned?  Can you
maintain the thiamine and uracil mutants by seeds on complete medium?<p>

JACOBS: Well, from both we got some seeds. The uracil mutants we have,
present some variegated aspect. There are spots on leaves, like the
maculata type.<p>

REDEI: What is the frequency with which you get these mutants?<p>

JACOBS: There are some difficulties of appraising because I have not
yet tested all the apparent mutants on singly supplemented media. Up
to now, some mutants only respond to a global medium as vitamins or
amino acids solutions. An approximate amount would be 0.7 to 0.8%.<p>

REDEI: Is that on seed basis?<p>

JACOBS: This number arises from the ratio of presumptive mutants found
to the total number of seedlings observed in this method of selection
(approximately 25,000).<p>

LANGRIDGE: This frequency of M1-plants is segregating mutants in the
second generation! These 0.7% are a very high frequency!<p>

REDEI: It is as high as in fungi! With similar non-selective
techniques BEADLE and TATUM (Amer. J. Bot. 32, 678, 1945) obtained
0.6% biochemical mutants in Neurospora and BONNER (Amer. J. Bos. 33,
788, 1946) 0.4% in Penicillium.<p>

BROWN: In your rescue method, when you supplement the media in the
second generation, you do not expect to get clear genetic segregation
ratios because of the chimeric structure on the plant in M1. How can
you be sure that these seedlings you supplement are really genetic
mutants?  You made the assumption that the seedlings 6 days old may
require something and then you add something and obtain seeds in some
cases on such supplemented plants. But did you in further generations
check the need for supplement because then segregation would be clear?<p>

JACOBS: In every stage of the schedule I cultivate the plants on
minimum medium to prove whether the selection is good or not.<p>

LANGRIDGE: Although not directly related to this paper, I should like
to mention a method of growing Arabidopsis which is very effective for
isolating certain sorts of mutants. Plants may be grown from seed
completely submerged in sterile solution in gas-washing flasks. They
receive minerals, 2% sucrose (to replace photosynthesis),
sulphanilamide (5*micro* g/ml to make reversible miniatures), a
synthetic hormone such as indole-butyric acid (to inhibit growth), and
sterile air bubbled through a sintered glass disc at the base of the
flask. One thousand plants may readily be screened, especially for
resistance mutants, with one litre of solution.<p>

VELEMINSKY: How do your mutants look like, are they chlorophyll
deficient or normal green?<p>

JACOBS: Thiamine, uracil and nicotinic acid mutants appear with
chlorophyll defects like variegation. In the case of amino acids
requirements, histidineless or one of the argineless look like viridis
or maculata at the cotyledon stage, but soon they die.<p>

FEENSTRA: We found that on minimal medium in some cases the growth was
better than on supplemented media. Did you have the same experience?<p>

JACOBS: Yes. From a physiological point of view, it seems to be of
interest to note, that for some plants vitamins or more often casein
hydrolysate give an inhibition of growth and morphological
alterations.<p>

VELEMINSKY: Is not this kind of reaction a question of osmotic
pressure!<p>

JACOBS: I have not tested this point, but for all the plants, we use
the same temperature and media conditions.<p>

VELEMINSKY: I noticed the effect of agents as inhibition.<p>

FEENSTRA: We followed up a few of these cases and traced what compound
should be responsible. Especially adenine is in many cases inhibitory.
Indeed there were mutants which were inhibited while the wild type was
not inhibited. On the other hand we might see that in the thiamine
mutants also thiamine in very low concentrations causes a very strict
inhibition in the wild type.<p>

REDEI: In what concentrations are these supplements added to the
mutants? How much do they tolerate? What is the minimum concentration
they responded to?<p>

JACOBS: I tested the response of mutants to a concentration gradient
of the required products. The different concentrations used have been
mentioned in No. 1 of "Arabidopsis Information Service", and the
detailed method will be published in the Bull. Acad. Roy. Sci.
Belgique.<p>

REDEI: What is the average concentration you tested?<p>

JACOBS: For example the methionine concentration is 0.6 mg per 100 ml
of mineral medium.<p>

LANGRIDGE: Thank you for these contributions. I was very much
impressed to see the progress today. It took me a couple of years to
find just one mutant, and Dr. JACOBS received the half dozen in
minimum.<p>
