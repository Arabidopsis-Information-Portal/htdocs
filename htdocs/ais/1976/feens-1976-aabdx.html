Nitrate reductase (Nar) activity in Arabidopsis thaliana is enhanced
in the presence of nitrate.  The genetic control of nitrate reduction
thus forms an object for the study of the genetic control of a
regulated physiological process in a higher plant.<p>

The first step in the experiments was the isolation of mutants unable
to carry out nitrate eduction, using chlorate resistance as a
selection criterium. Since Arabidopsis can use both nitrate and
ammonium for growth, such mutants can be grown to maturity using the
latter compound as a source of nitrogen. After mutagenic treatment of
seeds with nitrosoguanidine or EMS, chlorate resistant plants were
selected in the M2.  Progenies were tested for Nar activity. Two types
of mutants were found: (1) with a normal to slightly increased
activity, and (2) with a decreased activity.<p>

Chlorate resistance of the first type is caused by a reduced uptake of
chlorate. Sevral mutants of this type were found, presumably all
mutated in the same gene (chl-l) showing 14% recombination with an on
chromosome 1 (Oostindier-Braaksma and Feenstra, 1973a).  It later
turned out that these mutants also show a reduced uptake of nitrate.
They are now used for studying the physiology and genetic control of
the uptake of nitrate (Doddema et al, 1975).<p>

The second type was found less frequently and involves mutation at
different loci.  Mutation of the gene chl-2, located on chromosome 2
by its linkage to er (12% recombination), gives a reduction of Nar
activity to about 20% of wildtype (Oostindier-Braaksma and Feenstra,
1973a and b).  Growth on substrate containing nitrate as the only
nitrogen source is rather poor.<p>

Mutation of the gene rgn (mutant B25) gives a reduction of the enzyme
activity in 10 days old seedlings to 0-10% of wildtype and a very poor
growth on a substrate with nitrate as the sole nitrogen source. Growth
on ammonium nitrate is about equal to the growth of the wildtype on
this substrate, and different from the growth of the later type on
substrates with amonium only. The gene rgn is tightly linked to an and
is thus presumably located on chromosome 1, and not on chromosome 2,
as was concluded from preliminary experiments (Oostindier-Braaksma and
Feenstra, 1974).  Next to these mutants a few more were isolated in
which Nar activity was more or less reduced (Braaksma and Feenstra,
1975a).<p>

From the comparison of Km values for nitrate and NADH of nitrate
reductase from wildtype and from the chl-2 type it could not be
concluded that the properties of the enzyme in this mutant are
different from those of the wildtype enzyme.<p>

Revertants of the rgn mutant were isolated, in the expectation that
their properties would form a clue as to the nature of the rgn gene.
After mutagenic treatment revertants were looked for both in M1 and
M2.  No revertants were found in M1, but they could be isolated in M2.
Selection is simple, revertants show good growth on a substrate with
nitrate as the sole nitrogen source.  Up till now a number of
independently isolated revertants were obtained, 7 of which were
studied further.  Next to good growth on nitrate, a criterium for
reverison is sensitivity to chlorate. From some of these revertants
nonsegregating revertant lines could be obtained in the M3.  In these
cases, from analysis of the F2 after crossing of revertant by
wildtype, it could be shown that a suppressor mutation is resposnible
for the reversion. The suppressor segegated independently from the rgn
gene.<p>

The suppressors su-3 and su-4 proved to be recessive, both when tested
for chlorate sensitivity and by analysis for growth on nitrate as
nitrogen source. Suppressors su-1, su-5, and su-6 turned out to be
recessive as to chlorate sensitivity, but dominant when tested for
growth on nitrate.  Presently only speculations can be made as to why
such revertants were not found in the M1.  Revertants R2 and R7 kept
segregating ammonium-requiring plants in successive generations after
selfing. Complementation tests carried out with su-1, su-3, and su-4
indicate that these genes are allelic. Experiments to establish
linkage relationships of the suppressor loci are under way.<p>

The recombinant types su-1 su-1 rgn+ rgn+ and su-3 su-3 rgn+ rgn+ were
obtained by repeated test-crossing and progeny analysis, starting from
the double heterozygotes.<p>

The revertant lines show differences in Nar activity.  It has yet to
be determined whether these are specific for the suppressor genes
present.  In vitro Nar activity of plants of the R1 line (having su-1)
grown on ammonium nitrate, is about equal to that of wildtype, but
plants of R3 (containing su-3) showed a 2 to 3 times higher activity.
Both on ammonium and on nitrate alone differences are less pronounced.
Lines having the suppressor genes on a wildtype background do not
differ considerably from wildtype itself.  Results of Km studies on
nitrate reductase from wildtype and revertants do not suggest that the
enzyme from the revertants is different from that of wildtype. From
the above results the tentative conclusion is drawn that rgn is a
regulatory element in the control of the synthesis of nitrate
reductase. The possible working mechanism of rgn and suppressor genes
will be discussed.<p>
