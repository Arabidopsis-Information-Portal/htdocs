Postdoctoral position starting 1/2013, funded initially for 2 years 

Within the Dusseldorf-Cologne Excellence cluster, a postdoctoral positon 
will be available to investigate the transcriptional control of plant 
meristem functions and their evolutionary origin. The postdoctoral scientist 
will mainly work at the Heinrich-Heine University in Dusseldorf, but in 
close collaboration with research teams at the Max-Planck-Institute for 
Plant Breeding in Cologne and the Research Center Julich. The project will 
comprise plant phenotyping, tissue and RNA isolation via laser 
microdissection and application of next-generation sequencing technologies. 
The postdoctoral researcher will team up with computer scientists and 
mathematicians for data analysis and interpretation. 

The position also offers the possibility to apply for independent research 
projects. Career development will be strongly supported through dedicated 
postdoctoral programmes of the excellence cluster. Candidates should have a 
solid background in plant evolution and development.
