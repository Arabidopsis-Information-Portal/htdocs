The desiderability of auxotrophic mutants to any genetic program is
illustrated by their profound impact in the development of bacterial
and fungal genetics. Auxotrophs in higher plants are rare; only few
have been reported. There are some mutants in Arabidopsis (thiamine
pathway, nitrate reductase/uptake system, leaky tryptophan mutants, a
nonspecific arginine requirement, invertase, and a few others; ref
Langridge, 1955; Feenstra, 1964; Redei, 1975; Feenstra and Braaksma,
1976; Jacobs, 1967; D'Souza and Maher, 1976), in tomato (thiamine,
Langridge and Brock, 1961), in Zea mays (Gavazzi et al., 1975) and a
few other ones of no major significance. The analysis of mutation
spectra has been discussed previously (Li et al., 1967).<p>

Several researchers postulated that plant cell tissue culture, by
combining haploid cultures, in vitro mutagenesis and selection
followed by regeneration of complete plants, may provide the
microbial-like experimental system, which would allow the isolation of
auxotrophic plants and cell lines (Gresshoff and Doy, 1972; Negrutiu
et al., 1975; Carlson, 1970). Nothing of substance really has come of
this approach (Widholdm, 1978).<p>

Here I propose a coupling of the conventional, seed-based technology
with some in vitro and general biological considerations. The thoughts
expressed here are meant to stimulate discussion and hopeful
experimentation. Possibly, dialogue on this matter may clear up this
paradox regarding the limited spectrum of auxotrophs in higher plants.
The described thought experiment may be viewed as an extension of the
mutant isolation studies as reported by Jacobs (1965, 1967).<p>

The conventional mutant isolation procedure involved: seed
mutagenesis, rearing of M1 generation in soil, harvest of M2 (selfed)
generation, selection, rescue by nutritional supplementation and
finally characterization of progeny. Several parts of this technique
may select against the chance of recovery of a non-leaky auxotroph in
the M2. These are: 1) 'Rescue'-medium may be inadequate because of:-
(a) antagonism of metabolites at high concentrations; (b) uptake
barriers (possible ammonia control??); (c) supply of insufficient
amounts (difficult to determine the precise requirement because of
lack of auxotrophs (a catch 22 situation); (d) microbial breakdown and
competition for supplied nutrients.<p>

2) Seed storage for required substance may be insufficient to allow
germination to 'rescuable' stage. Thus many partially developed
seedlings or nongerminators (lethals??) may be in this category.<p>

3) "Diplontic selection" (Balkema, 1971) against heterozygous (+/-)
cell lineage in chimeral M1 plant (+/-//+/+) caused by loss or
decrease of reproductive "fitness". This is based on a GECN
(genetically effective cell number, Redei, 1975) for Arabidopsis in
the mutagenized embryo being 2. Heterozygosity for alleles in amino
acid/nucleotide metabolism of lower eukaryotes (Chlamydomonas,
Aspergillus, Yeast, etc.) leads to decreased specific activities and
cell generation times as compared to the homozygous wildtype (+/+)
diploid control. This effect on cell growth and division may alter
reproductive "fitness" at the stage of flowering, seed set, fill and
nutritional storage. This, additionally, even if seed set and
development was complete, may lead to seed with decreased storage (see
point 2 above). Thus only mutant alleles, which fail to affect the
"fitness" of a cell lineage (e.g., because of cross feeding from
wildtype cell lineage, leakiness of mutant allele, decrease cellular
requirement or structural (morphological) characteristics) are
transmitted and expressed as homozygous recessive diploids in the M2.
External nutritional supplementation during M1 growth may overcome
this problem.<p>

The above leads to the following suggestion for a mutant isolation
experiment with Arabidopsis thaliana. Other small seeded plant species
may be attempted as well (i.e., Petunia, clover, tobacco). The thought
experiment is as follows:<p>

(i) mutagenesis seeds (surface sterile) (ii) rear M1 aseptically in
supplemented medium containing few, non-antagonistic nutrients (e.g.,
tryptophan, arginine, lysine, thymidine) at non-lethal concentrations.
Such levels as well as a verification of uptake and nutritional
"effectiveness" can be obtained by antimetabolite reversal
experiments. Furthermore, an alternative nitrogen source to nitrate
may be desirable, if nitrate reductase deficient mutants are to be
isolated by selection for chlorate resistance; (iii) allow mature and
complete seed development on all plants. Leave extra time to give some
of the slow ones a change as well. These may be those heterozygotic
'chimerae'.  (iv) harvest selfed M2 generation; (v) germinate and grow
M2 aseptically on a defined medium containing a limited amount (i.e. 2
p.c.) of previously used nutritional supplements (point 2, avove).
Score and select for retarded growth relative to control and/or for
chlorate resistance. Rescue by transfer to complete medium; (vi)
characterise plants to ascertain auxotrophic mutation.<p>

Mechanically the above is possible. One can "plate" Arabidopsis seeds
in soft-agar (0.5 p.c. Difco) in an overlay methods similar to
phage-platings. Large dessication dishes with glass covers or plastic
foil function well as bulk culture vessels.<p>

It is hoped that the above thought experiment provides stimulus and
food for discussion, if not experimentation.<p>
