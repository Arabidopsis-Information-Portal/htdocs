    A postdoctoral position is available to study the relation between cell wall
    structure and morphogenesis. The project uses the emerging model grass,
    Brachypodium distachyon. We are characterizing a set of mutants with
    aberrant root morphology and we are inactivating genes that are known in
    other species to be important for expansion anisotropy. Finally we are also
    imaging the cell wall at high resolution with SEM. The position requires a
    Ph.D. in a relevant area of biology and preference will be given to
    candidates having experience with either molecular genetics of grasses or
    ultrastructure (especially AFM or high resolution-SEM). The Baskin lab
    participates actively in the University of Massachusetts-Amherst
    Interdisciplinary Program in Plant Biology and also in a cluster of campus
    scientists on working on B. distachyon. The University of Massachusetts is
    an Equal Opportunity Employer and I encourage all qualified persons to
    apply. To apply, please send your cv to <a
