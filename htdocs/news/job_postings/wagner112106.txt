A post-doctoral position is available to study chromatin remodeling in the laboratory of Dr. 
Doris Wagner in the Department of Biology at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling ATPases are important transcriptional co-regulators in multicellular 
eukaryotes. The precise role of these proteins in the organism has remained poorly understood because 
null mutants in most are embryonic lethal. Recently, we isolated viable SWI/SNF ATPase null mutants 
in Arabidopsis. Our studies revealed that these chromatin remodelers regulate multiple developmental 
pathways. In addition we observed a remarkable degree of functional specificity for SWI/SNF chromatin 
remodeling in individual developmental processes.

This postdoctoral position is to extend these studies and to address the following two central questions:
• what are the developmentally important targets of SWI/SNF ATPases in the organism?
• what is the precise mechanism by which SWI/SNF ATPases control their target genes in vivo?
The qualified candidate is expected to use and develop state-of-the art forward/reverse genetic and 
genomic approaches to address these questions. Individuals with experience in these approaches are 
strongly encouraged to apply.

To apply please send a CV and three reference letters via email to wagnerdo@sas.upenn.edu.
