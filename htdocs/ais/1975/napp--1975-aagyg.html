In the last AIS issue KRANZ (1974) communicated some genetical aspects
of Pfr - and GA3-induced seed germination.  On this occasion I report
briefly about the actual situation of some series of our experiments
which are still in progress.  One of these series concerns the
genetical basis of the light requirement of seed germination in the
race Hannovrsch-Munden (hm) of Arabidopsis thaliana.  With the same
intention, KUGLER (1951) had crossed this race with several others
which, however, germinate not only under light but also in constant
darkness. But KUGLER did not draw any conclusions with regard to kind
and number of genes involved because of the behaviour of the F1
generations and the segregations in back crosses and F2.  As far as
reciprocal F1 hybrids were concerned, a maternal influence at least
(probably of the plasmon, but hardly of the testa) could not entirely
be excluded.<p>

Hm is a summer annual race; in the context of certain vernalization
experiments it was desirable to transfer its light requirement of seed
germination into a winter annual race (Stockholm = St).  A number of
F1 plants resulted from a cross St x Hm (H10 x H5).  Seeds were
separately harvested from 55 descendants (obtained by spontaneous
selfing) of the F1 plant, H176.  A test sowing of 18 to 36 days old
seeds from 17 of these 44 F2 plants under light or darkness,
respectively, showed that there was still an important requirement of
after-ripening (also originating from Hm) in many of the F3 families.
Therefore, another sowing was done when the seeds of those 55 F2
plants were 308 to 526 days old, i.e., when after-ripening, according
to KUGLER, should already have been completed for a long time. The
seed was sown, as usual, in Petri dishes of 9 cm diameter upon filter
paper moistened with 2 ml of distilled water. Then it was kept at
20*degrees*C in darkness for 7 days.  Only in one of those 55 F3
families - H226s - not a single seed (among 192) germinated within a
week. &#160;This result suggests that three gene loci might be involved
in the light requirement of Hm, - a conclusion that, for the rest,
SHIFRISS and GEORGE (1965) had also drawn from their investigations in
two cucumber cultivars.<p>

In order to test whether the "aim" of breeding had been attained,
plants of the just mentioned F3 family, H226s, were grown until
flowering. Their average age at flowering equalled that of the summer
annual parent, Hm (approximately 44 days from sowing), but the
variation was much greater. Again, seed was harvested from 70 H226s
plants (K11 through K80).  Among the resulting F4 families the
earliest ones flowered 9 days earlier and the latest ones 9 days later
than Hm. The flowering age of all these 70 F4 families was far from
that of the winter annual parent, St. (approximately 120 days).
Therefore, it may be supposed that the major gene loci for
vernalization requirement (NAPP-ZINN, 1957) could be situated in the
same chromosomes as those loci competent for the light requirement of
seed germination.<p>
