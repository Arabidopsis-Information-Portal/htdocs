The usefulness of Arabidopsis thaliana as an assay plant to screen
compounds for plant regulatory (p.g.r.) activity has been described by
Brown (1972). The response of the plant grown over a 20 day period
from seed germination to flower formation on an agar nutrient medium
containing a test compound has proved a convenient indicator of
effects on roots, shoot growth and development (Brown et al., 1972;
Phillips et al., 1981).<p>

Recently a study of the influence of sub-lethal doses of growth
regulators on the progeny of treated Arabidopsis plants was initiated.
This involved extending the normal assay period from the flower
formation stage (day 20) to the mature plant seed harvesting stage
(day 50) so that effects on seed yield and viability could be
determined. This communication reports the effect of the growth
retardant chlormequat chloride on seed yield (weight/plant).<p>

Arabidopsis thaliana (cv. Estland) was grown on an agar nutrient
medium (Brown, 1972) into which laboratory grade chlormequat chloride
was incorporated at 0,1,2,4 and 10 micro g/ml. Single plants were
grown under sterile conditions in test tubes and illuminated
continuously under fluorescent lights at 24*degrees*C. Pods were
harvested from mature plants 50 days after initial seeding. Seed from
each plant was stripped from the pods, weighed and tested for
viability by reseeding on fresh agar nutrient.<p>

In addition to the greatly reduced shoot growth noted earlier (Brown,
1972), there was an increase in seed yield and pod number as compared
with untreated control plants but no change in seed viability (Table
1).<p>

of A. thaliana.<p>

Statistical analysis of the seed yield data indicated that there was a
highly significant (P<.001) positive seed yield response to increasing
concentrations of the growth retardant. The results are consistent
with the stimulating effect of chlormequat chloride on seed, pod and
fruit yield that have been observed in the field (Nickell, 1982). This
suggests that the Arabidopsis assay, when extended to include seed
harvesting, could be an indicator of potentially useful yield
enhancing agents which are active under root uptake conditions.<p>
