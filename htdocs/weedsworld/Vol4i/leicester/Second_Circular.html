      <h1>European Symposium on Photomorphogenesis</h1>
      <h2>July 12 - 18, 1997</h2>
      <h2>To be held at
The University of Leicester
Leicester, UK
URL:<A HREF="http://sun2.botany.le.ac.uk/" target="_top">http://sun2.botany.le.ac.uk/</a>
</h2><hr>
      <h2>Second Circular</h2>


      <h2>European Symposium on Photomorphogenesis</h2>

      <p>For the last three decades, a series of Symposia on Plant Photomorphogenesis have been held at a range of European centres.   Initially held annually, and attended by small numbers of plant scientists, these Symposia have come to be regarded as the most successful regular meetings in this field.   The organisation of these meetings has been described as "democratic anarchy", since there is no committee, no parent society or institutional body, nor is there a continuing fund to support the meetings.   Traditionally, individual research groups have offered to host these meetings, and for 1997, the honour has fallen to the University of Leicester.  
</p>
      <p>Although based in Europe, the ESOP meetings have from time to time been very international in scope and content, and for 1997 we wish to provide a truly international atmosphere, and to attract to the meeting participants, from anywhere in the world, who are interested in the responses of plants to light signals.   The scientific programme will be wide-ranging, allowing maximum opportunity for contact and interaction between the participants.   Setting the scene will be a number of Plenary Lectures by invited speakers, but the body of the meeting will consist of submitted oral papers presented by both established workers and those in the early phases of their careers.   There will be NO concurrent sessions, and specific time slots will be provided for poster viewing.  
</p>
      <h3>Scientific Programme</h3>

      <p>The ESOP meetings have always been centred on the responses of plants to light signals mediated by the phytochrome and cryptochrome photoreceptor families.   In the last few years, major advances in understanding have been made possible by the application of molecular biological and genetical approaches, and it is expected that these aspects will form the core of the programme.   The emphasis will be on fundamental science, although ecological, evolutionary and biotechnological aspects will be covered.   Applications of photomorphogenesis in agriculture and horticulture will be represented only in so far as they contribute to the scientific knowledge base of the overall subject.
</p>
      <h3>Special Issue of Plant, Cell and Environment</h3>

      <p>All participants will receive a complimentary copy of a Special Issue of Plant, Cell and Environment that is being published to celebrate the 20th year of the journal.   The Special Issue will comprise a series of invited Minireview Articles featuring the latest results and concepts in Plant Photomorphogenesis; its publication is timed to coincide with the 1997 ESOP Meeting.

	  <h3>General Information</h3>

	  <h4>The Conference Venue</h4>

	  <p>The venue for the 1997 ESOP meeting is the Conference Centre at the University of Leicester.   The Centre, comprising several, closely-linked buildings used during the academic session by students, is surrounded by attractive gardens, and bordered by the 16 acre Leicester University Botanic Garden.   Accommodation (<A HREF="Accommodation_Booking_Form.html">booking form</a>) is available either in standard student rooms, or in en-suite rooms at a slightly higher cost.   All the lectures and poster sessions will be held at the Conference Centre.   Food, though English in nature is, by all accounts, very good!   A congenial - possibly even convivial - bar will be available each evening, and a conference dinner will be held on the last evening.</p>

	  <p><b>Bowder Court</b>  is a purpose built block providing en-suite accommodation in single study bedrooms which have tea and coffee making facilities.  <b>Cost per delegate: &pound;225.</b></p>

	  <p><b>Stamford Hall</b> is a purpose built block providing single study bedrooms - all rooms have wash basin and shaver point, tea and coffee making facilities.  Bathroom facilities are shared. <b> Cost per delegate:  &pound;185.</b></p>

	  <h3>Electricity Supply</h3>
	  <p>Outlets in most of the Halls will only accept round 3 pin 2 amp plugs.  Any equipment of a high wattage will fuse the sockets.  Shaver sockets are to be found in study bedrooms or nearby bathrooms.  The Hall Manager keeps a small supply of adaptors:  these are available on loan on payment of a returnable &pound;5 deposit.</p>

	  <p><em>NB. There are no double rooms available.  Please contact the Conference Secretary if you wish to receive details of local hotels.</em></p>

	  <h3>Local Facilities</h3>
	  <p>There are branches of most major banks and building societies, a post office, various shops, public houses and restaurants in Oadby village, which is within about 20 minutes' walking time from the Halls.  Squash and tennis courts are available and there is a swimming pool within easy walking distance.</p>

	  <h3>Car Parking</h3>
	  <p>Limited parking space is available within the grounds.</p>

<tr>

		<p>The phytochrome photoreceptor family regulates plant architecture in response to environmental light signals.  Phytochromes mediate the shade avoidance syndrome, in which plants react to far-red radiation reflected from neighbors by elongation growth, occurring at the expense of leaf and storage organ production.  We show that transgenic overproduction of phytochrome A in tobacco suppresses shade avoidance, causing proximity-conditional dwarfing.  At high densities in the field, assimilates show an enhanced allocation to leaves, with a concomitant increase in harvest index.  Transfer of this approach to other crop plants could provide significant improvements in productivity.</p>
