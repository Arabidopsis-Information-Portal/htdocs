Sterile seeds have been treated, under continuous illumination, with
Escherichia coli DNA2H3H obtained from the C.34 strain, thymineless,
adapted for growth on deuterated water and grown in about 1
microCi/micromg (2.5 x 10.6 dpm/microg); its bouyant density in CaCl
being 1,730 g/cm3.  The DNA has been isolated from Arabidopsis
thaliana (d=1.698 g/cm3) by a method using pronase for
deproteinisation (LEDOUX, 1968)<p>

a) Treatment of seeds.  Dry sterile seeds or sterile seeds
preincubated for 24 h in water were treated with the labelled DNA for
3 days. The plantlets were then washed with sterile water and further
grown on mineral medium for 2 days.  Fig 1a and 1b show the result
obtained.  It can be seen that the uptake is much larger in the dry
seeds than in the wet ones.  Fig 1c shows that the seed coats contain
less ratioactivity than the seedlings and that this radioactivity
corresponds to depolymerised E. coli DNA 2H3H.<p>

b) Treatment of apex. Fig. 2 shows a comparison between the results
obtained with mature plants coming from treated seeds (Fig. 2a).  It
can be seen that with the latter method a higher amount of radioactive
molecules can be recovered, but that their quality is very similar in
both cases.<p>
