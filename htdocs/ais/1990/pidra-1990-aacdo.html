INTRODUCTION<p>

Nitrates as the most important source of nitrogen in higher plants are
metabolized by means of nitrate reductase (NR) and nitrite reductase
(NiR) to ammonia whose NH2 group are used to form proteins.
Considerable amount of harmful nitrates accumulated in vegetable food
of man become to be a serious problem today.<p>

Some environmental effects are known to support an uptake and
accumulation of nitrates in plants. Weak intensity of illumination,
high level of nitrate in soil and lack of oxygen are known to be
leading to enhance the amount of NO 3- in vegetables grown in
greenhouses (PRUGAR and PRUGAROVA, 1985). While no differences in NO
3-uptake were found either in light or darkness, no activity or NR was
observed in darkness (PRUGAR and PRUGAROVA, 1985). The nitrite
reductase activity is always higher than that of nitrate reductase
(STULEN and LANTING, 1976) and so the nitrate accumulation in plant
tissues is mainly limited by NR activity. But genetically determined
speed of growing of tissues and NO 3- imput also affects the final
content of nitrates. The synthesis of both enzymes is induced by NO 3-
substrate (ONDREJ, 1985). A scheme of supposed regulation of uptake
and metabolisation of NO 3- in plants was suggested by DODDEMA,
HOFSTRA and FEENSTRA (1978).<p>

The genetic control of NO 3- dynamics in higher plants appears not to
be simple. In A. thaliana and some other higher plants several mutants
were induced with suppressed NR activity (OOSTINDIER-BRAAKSMA and
FEENSTRA, 1973, 1974) and also revertants were induced and studied
(BRAAKSMA and FEENSTRA, 1975, 1979, 1980; FEENSTRA and BRAAKSMA,
1976). But no mutants are known in NiR activity. These studies suggest
that NO 3- content in plant tissues seems to be controlled by various
genes.<p>

Aimed selection of favourable genotypes from the point of view of
nitrate accumulation appears to be desirable in vegetable breeding
programs nowadays. In the present paper we try to evaluate an effect
of several environments that differ in an intensity of illumination
and nitrate fertilization on leaf nitrate content and leaf area on one
hand, and on the other the effect of different genotypes on the same
values. The set of A. thaliana lines differing in many respects served
us as a suitable model for this study.<p>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<p>

Seven lines of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. were used in our
experiments: Da(3)-13, Jm(2)-14 (selected from Moravian natural
populations), H-55 (supplied by NAPP-ZINN), Di-G (supplied by
MUELLER), La-0, Nd-0 and Wil-2 (supplied by KRANZ and KIRCHHEIM).<p>

The plants were grown in polystyrene boxes (8x12x24 cm) filled by a
mixture of soil, peat and sand (1:1:1). Twelve plants were planted in
each box. All the above mentioned lines were grown in four different
environments. Differences between environments were caused by
different illumination intensity and different nitrate supply. As a
source of light high pressure sodium-vapour lamps were used. NO 3-
fertilization was performed by watering with 0.5% solution of KNO3.
Characterization of all environments is in Table 1.<p>

As soon as the first blossom had appeared all the rosette leaves were
cut off. We measured length and width of the ten largest leaves and
calculated the leaf blade area. Then the leaves were desiccated and NO
3- content was estimated by means of ion selective electrode (SENKYR
and PETR, 1979) according to the procedure of KRALOVA (1988).
The results of NO 3- content estimation and leaf blade area
measurement were processed with the help of stability parameters
calculation method developed by FINLAY and WILKINSON (1963) and
adapted by EBERHART and RUSSEL (1966). The stability parameters b i
(regression coefficient) and s 2di (deviation from linear regression)
were determined by procedure according to WOLFRAM (1973) and HAUFE and
GIEDEL (1978). According to this procedure each environment was
characterized by its environmental index I j.<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

There is the nitrate accumulation in rosette leaves of A. thaliana
lines in various environments demonstrated by Figure 1. The Figure 2
represents the same demonstration for the rosette leaf blade area. The
environments are represented by their environmental index values (I j)
on x-axis. The environments stimulating lower nitrate accumulation
(Figure 1) or smaller leaf blade area (Figure 2) lie on this axis left
from zero, the environments stimulating higher nitrate content and
larger leaves are situated on the opposite side. From comparing these
facts with environments' characteristics in the Table 1 has resulted
that nitrate fertilization influenced both nitrate content and leaf
area more than the illumination intensity. From the point of view of
the nitrate accumulation the best conditions were in environment 2
(high illumination intensity, no fertilization), the worse conditions
were in environment 3 (low illumination intensity, fertilized).  The
reactions of the individual genotypes in different environments were
approximatelly similar, e.g. there was small genotype-environment
interaction. This conclusion results also from Tables 2 and 3, where
the analysis of variance for nitrate accumulation and leaf blade area
are summarized. The mean square for interaction was not calculated but
in both cases the residual mean square is small in comparison with
those for genotypes and environments. Effects of genotypes both on NO
3- accumulation and leaf blade area was smaller than that of
environments but highly significant.<p>

The average values (y i) and coherent stability parameters (b i, s
2di) both of nitrate content and leaf blade area are summarized in
Table 4. The best genotypes from the point of view of nitrate
accumulation are those with low average value of nitrate content (y
i), good adaptability to unfavourable environments (b i<1) and high
stability (s 2di is small).<p>

Only two lines of the tested set approached these parameters: H-55 and
Da(3)-13. But from comparing the average values and stability
parameters of the leaf blade area, we can see that line H-55 has
larger leaves and lower stability parameters than the line Da(3)-13.
It means that in the line H-55 the great deal of nitrates is
metabolized and used for the leaf growth. As the nitrate reduction is
limited by a nitrate reductase activity (STULEN and LANTING, 1975) we
suppose that there is an enhanced NR acitivity in this line. On the
other hand the line Da(3)-13 has smaller leaves and higher stability
parameters for leaf blade area.  Therefore, the low nitrate content in
its leaf tissues is probably caused by a low uptake of NO 3- from the
soil. Thus, the geno-types as H-55 would be desirable in vegetable
breeding programs from the point of view of low nitrate accumulation
in leaf tissues.<p>
