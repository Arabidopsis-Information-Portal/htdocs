The analysis of the great number of mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana
(L.) HEYNH. revealed several main morphotypes of the membrane systems.
These morphotypes have been compared to the chloroplast membrane
system of some existing taxons (Fig. 1).  The scheme demonstrates the
similarity between the variability of mutation of Arabidopsis thaliana
chloroplasts and the membrane system of some other plants. The
chloroplast membrane system of the well investigated plants
(Chlamydomonas reinhardi Hordiumvulgare, Posum sativum, Zea mays.
Lycopersicum esculentum, Nicotiana tabacum, Oeoothera) is much alike
to the morphotypes of the membrane system in Arabidopsis thaliana.
This information suggests that chloroplasts of the well investigated
plants have homological variability in their membrane systems. This
homology makes worthy a study of the wide range of the plastom mutants
to seek answer to the problem whether the morphotypes of their
membranes would be similar to those of the nuclear mutants.<p>

Such a study may shed light on the origin and evolution of the
chloroplast membrane system in the plant world.<p>
