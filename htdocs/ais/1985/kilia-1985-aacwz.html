INTRODUCTION<p>

Former publications referring to the population genetics of
Arabidopsis thaliana have exhibited marked differences between
populations, especially as regards flowering time. These differences
were habitat dependent (Jones, 1971) and related to temperature and
altitude gradient (Cetl, 1978). Interpopulation variability was also
observed with respect to a range of other traits (Jones, 1971; Usmanov
et al., 1978). However, the number of papers concerning variability of
a set of characters jointly is limited. Utilizing multivariate
analysis investigations concerned differentiation between strains of
Laibach collection (Crovello, 1968) and relation between characters in
population (Fershtat et al., 1971). The main purpose of carrying out
the present studies is an attempt to designate patterns of
interpopulation variability of A. thaliana from Poland with the use of
multivariate statistical methods.<p>

MATERIAL AND METHODS<p>

Analysis included 21 A. thaliana populations from 4 geographical
regions of Poland and laboratory line Wilna-2 (WT). The geographical
distribution of the populations is shown in Figure 1.<p>

III - Upper Silesia; region VI - Beskid Wysoki Mts.<p>

Thirty plants of each population sample were grown individually from
seed in plastic pots containing a mixture of soil and sand. The
cultures were run in a completely randomized block design with 3
replications in a glasshouse with supplementary fluorescent lighting.
Each plant was analyzed for 5 phenological and 20 morphological
traits: 1- germination, 2- budding, 3- beginning of flowering, 4-
setting of the first silique, 5- ripening of the first silique, 6-
number of rosette leaves, 7- maximum length of the rosette leaf, 8-
maximum width of the rosette leaf, 9- number of stem leaves,
10-maximum length of the stem leaf, 11- maximum width of the stem
leaf, 12- distance between the first laterala branch and rosete, 13-
length of the leader, 14- number of lateral branches, 15- length of
the first lateral branch, 16- number of sterile flowers on leader, 17-
length of the peduncle of the first silique on leader, 18- length of
the first silique on leader, 19- maximum length of the peduncle of the
silique, 20- maximum length of the silique, 21- number of flowers on
leader, 22- number of siliques on leader, 23- number of flowers on
lateral branches, 24- number of siliques on lateral branches, 25-
number of stems.<p>

The data were statistically processed. Variability of each individual
character was investigated by the univeriate analysis of variance and
Tukeys Test. With respect to all traits jointly multivariate analysis
of variance for randomised block design was performed (Ceranka et al.,
1976) together with canonical variate analysis. In addition,
generalised Mahalanobis' distances, the measure of the taxonomic
distance between populations, were computed (Sneath and Sokal 1973).<p>

RESULTS<p>

Multivariate analysis of variance exhibited significant differences
among the studied populations regarding the combination of all traits.
A general hypothesis, which refers to lack of these differences was
rejected (F 0.05 = 10.12 > F = 1.40) on the significance level *alpha*
= 0.05. This result was confirmed by the use of univariate statistical
methods. As a result of one-way analysis of variance and Tukeys test
one can observe (Table 1) that the most variable traits in our study
are no. 6 (number of rosette leaves), no. 7 (maximum length of the
rosette leaf) and no. 2 (budding). It is interesting that the
populations from the South of Poland (especially from the Beskidy
Mountains) are characterized by the highest values for these traits.<p>

Investigated populations are significantly differentiated as regards
length of the peduncle of the first silique (17) and maximum length of
the peduncle of the silique (19), and pattern of variability for both
traits was almost the same. The populations from the north of Poland
are characterized by short peduncles of the silique and the
populations from the south by long peduncles.<p>

Table 1: Variation between A. thaliana populations as regards selected
phenological and morphological traits.<p>

Interpopulation variation for traits no. 18 and 20 calls for
attention. Analysis of variance and Tukeys test show considerable
differentiation of populations with respect to maximum length of the
silique while the length of the first silique on leader is the least
variable trait. Variation of all 25 characters is statistically
significant, but results of several of them are not presented in Table
1 due to space limitations.<p>

Analysis of each individual character does not show the clear cut
relationship between variation and the geographical factor. The only
exception is the certain distinctness of the mountain populations.
Traits, which distinguished these populations from the remaining ones
are characters no. 2, 13 and 24. For these traits the mountain
populations exhibited significantly higher values as compared to the
rest. The distinctness of the population 21 calls for special
mentioning. It differs significantly from the remaining ones as
regards 14 characters, exhibiting the highest mean values.<p>

Interesting conclusions may be drawn from the results of canonical
analysis, which enables transformation of a data matrix into new, so
called canonical variates. The first canonical variate (V 1) has the
largest variance that can be found by a linear transformation of the
data, the second (V 2) has the largest variance uncorrelated to the
first and so on. In our study the first five canonical variates
accounted for 66.1, 6.9, 6.4, 3.8, and 3.3% of the total variation,
respectively.<p>

A graphic illustration of the canonical analysis consists of
diagrammes of the population position in the system of the 1st and 2nd
(Figure 2a) as well as the 1st and 3rd canonical axes. Both diagrammes
show the clear-cut distinctness of the population 21 from the Beskidy
Mountains from the remaining ones. Silesian populations are markedly
more diversified as compared to the populations from region I and II
which cluster with line Wilna-2. For example, the populations 16, 17,
18, and 19 sampled from close localities are very dispersed in the
diagrammes. Looking at the Figure 2b one can see certain distinctness
of the populations 8 and 11 from Silesia.<p>

(A) and 1st and 3rd canonical axes (B).<p>

Dendrite of the shortest connections between the populations traced on
the basis of the Mahalanobis distance confirmed genetical similarity
of the populations from region I and line Wilna-2 (Figure 3). Dendrite
also shows a resemblance to Silesian populations which, apart from the
populations 6 and 17, are connected by the shortest distances.
Similarly as in the case of the canonical axes, dendrite exhibits
marked distinctness of the population 21. This population is not the
most similar to the population 20 from the same geographical region.
Both mountain populations are connected with the two different
populations from the south of Silesia.<p>

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION<p>

Application of comparative culture under uniform conditions of the
test environment allowed to indicate considerable variability of A.
thaliana populations for a wide range of phenological and
morphological characters. This variation rather did not exhibit
correlation with localization of populations, although for several
characters it is possible to find geographical trends.<p>

Similarly as in the case of differentiation for particular traits
interpopulation differences regarding all traits together was highly
significant. The value of the test function for the general hypothesis
was markedly influenced by the clear-cut distinctness of the
population 21, however. The considerable differentiation of Silesian
populations was also revealed, but separation of populations from
different geographical region was not tested. The reason for the lack
of geographical differentiation may be a random transfer of seeds by
human agricultural activities. Especially, this is probably the best
explanation since almost all the sampled populations were found in
weed habitats.<p>

Interesting conclusions may be drawn from a comparison of
differentiation levels of poulations from various geographical
regions. The populations from region I and II were more homogeneous as
compared with Silesian and the mountain populations. The reason for
marked diversity of Silesian populations may be considerable
differences in the level and direction of the selection pressures of
anthropic factors in this region. Silesia is an urbanized and highly
industrialized region and an important role of environmental
pollutants as the selective factors has been already demonstrated
(Bradshaw, 1976; Ernst et al., 1983). Genetic drift may be the other
reason of differentiation between Silesian populations since their
individuals were markedly less numerous than those from the
populations of region I and II.<p>

Variation between the populations from region IV can also be explained
by differences in selection pressures as distinct ecological
conditions may exist even within the limited mountain area. However,
differences between the mountain populations are mainly conditioned by
the absolute distinctness of the population 21 from the remaining
ones. Similar result has been obtained by Cetl et al., (1973), as they
found genetically unique mountain populations in Czechoslovakia.
Authors of the above mentioned paper suggested the following
hypothesis: "This fact can be connected with extreme environmental
conditions on the mountain localities, where only unique genotype
could be successful in founding a population" This explanation seems
to be the most reasonable one in the case of the population 21 in our
study. Plants from that population characterized by exceptional vigour
and fertility, the features which can ensure survival of the
population under severe mountain conditions.<p>

SUMMARY<p>

Multivariate analysis of variance exhibited significant differences in
5 phenological and 20 morphological traits among 21 A. thaliana
populations from 4 geographical regions of Poland. Populations from
the South are characterized by highest values for the most variable
traits (budding, number and maximum length of rosette leaves).
Canonical analysis of variates shows the clear-cut distinctness of a
population from the Beskidy Mountains; Silesian populations are also
considerably differentiated which is demonstrated by Mahalanobis
distance parameter. Conclusions are drawn from the differentiation
levels of populations from 4 geographical regions; the reason for
marked diversity of Silesian populations may be considerable
differences in the anthropic selection pressure of this urbanized and
industrialized region.<p>
