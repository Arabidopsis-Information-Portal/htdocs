gene function with microarray data from poplar.  In addition, the candidate

Applicants should have interest in developing a career in
bioinformatics/systems biology.  Those who have skills and experience in at
least one of the following two areas are encouraged to apply: Computer
programming (web application), gene expression data analysis.  Strong
ability in data manipulation using programming languages like R/SAS, perl,
java, and C is anticipated.  The candidate should possess the ability to
work independently and the attitude to work cooperatively in a team
environment.  A background in either machine learning or molecular biology
will be a plus, though not a requirement.
