In a previous communication (FEENSTRA, 1967) a method for the harvest
of large quantities of seed was described.  In this method
polyethylene sleeves are placed around the plants.  As a disadvantage
it was mentioned that the control of aphid or other insect
infestations became much more difficult.  We have now found that
control of such infestations is possible by means of Shell "Vapona"
strip, effusing dichloorvos" (an choline esterase inhibitor).<p>

In our experiments plants are grown in pots, 100 of which are placed
on a plastic tray, 75 x 75 cm.  When aphids are found on plants, a
hood, 50 cm high and made of wood and polyethylene foil, is placed
over the tray.  Under the hood a piece of Vapona strip (8 cm long) is
placed; the hood is left over the plants for four hours. A high
relative humidity promotes the action of the strips. The dosage thus
given is sufficient to kill aphids, also when present within sleeves,
whereas no damage is done to the plants.<p>

We did not investigate whether the temperature affects the results.
In our greenhouse temperature fluctuates between 23*degrees* and
27*degrees*C.<p>
