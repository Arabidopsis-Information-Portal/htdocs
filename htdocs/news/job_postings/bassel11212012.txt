School of Biosciences & the University of Birmingham 
Division of Plant & Crop Sciences 

Research Fellow in Cellular morphodynamics and genome-wide networks driving 
plant cell shape change (Fixed-term) 

£27,578 - £35,938 per annum depending on skills and experience. Salary 
progression beyond this scale is subject to performance. 

Applications are invited for the above post which will be based at the 
University of Birmingham. This project will use a combination of gene 
co-functional network inference, molecular genetics, and quantitative 3D 
cellular morphodynamics to uncover regulatory networks driving plant cell 
shape change (for recent work in the lab see Bassel et al. (2011) PNAS 
(USA), 108:9709-14 and Bassel et al. (2011) Plant Cell 23:3101-16). This 
is a collaborative project between Dr. George Bassel, University of 
Birmingham and Prof. Michael Hodsworth, University of Nottingham. 

Candidates should have a PhD, or equivalent, in plant molecular genetics. 
Experience with molecular cloning, confocal microscopy and a willingness to 
learn new computer software will be particularly advantageous. 

This post will be offered on a fixed-term contract for a period of 36 
months and will be available from 1 December 2012. 

Informal enquiries may be addressed to George W Bassel, tel: 01214142502 or 
Email: g.w.bassel@bham.ac.uk. Please note that applications sent direct to 
this Email address will not be accepted.
