Description:

A postdoctoral position to work on small RNAs involved in hormone signaling and 
plant development is available in the lab of Chris Rock at Texas Tech University 
(http://www.biol.ttu.edu).  The successful candidate will have first-author 
publications and expertise in small RNA biology (not necessarily in plants).  
Working experience with in situ hybridization, transcriptomics, epifluorescence 
microscopy, N. benthamiana transient assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and 
bioinformatics including Perl programming would be a plus.  This is a full-time, 
24 month appointment, renewable upon satisfactory progress and continued 
funding.  Review of applications will begin immediately until the position is 
filled.  TTU is an AA/EO employer and minorities are encouraged to apply.
