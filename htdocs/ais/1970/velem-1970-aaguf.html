 The pH of the solution during the treatment of Arabidopsis seeds
influenced the mutagenic effectiveness of 7 nitrosoamides:
N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, N-ethyl-N-nitroso-urea, N,
N'-diamethyul-N-nitrosourea, N,N'-trimethyl-N-nitrosourea,
N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitosoguanidine,
N-ethyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine and
N-methyl-N-nitroso-p-toluenesulfonamide.  When the half-life of
decomposition of a tested nitrosoamide was shorter than the duration
of treatment, a considerable decrease in the mutagenic effectiveness
was observed. This was mostly at alkaline pH.<p>

The pH inside the Arabidopsis seeds (pH 4.4 to 5.2) was not influenced
by the buffers applied, even at extreme pH values. The decrease in
mutagenic effectiveness can be explained, therefore, by decrease in
the nitrosoamide concentration, due to its decomposition outside the
seeds.<p>

The nitrosoamines ethyvinylnitrosoamine and methylbenzylnitrosoamine,
although very stable at all pH levels, decreased in mutagenic
effectiveness at pH 11 or 12.  Explanations for this phenomenon, e.g.,
a decreased rate of incorporation, are discussed.<p>

No evidence that the nitrosoamides at low pH induce mutations in
Arabidopsis via a "nitrous acid mechanism" could be demonstated.
Nitrous acid, however, can participate in the lethal action of some
nitrosoamides at low pH.<p>
