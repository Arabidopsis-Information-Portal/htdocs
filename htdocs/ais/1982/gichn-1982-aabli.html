INTRODUCTION<p>

It has been shown by Samson and Cairns (1977) that cells of
Escherischia coli growing in a low level of MNNG develop a resistance
both to killing and to the mutagenic effects of a subsequent challenge
dose of MNNG. This phenomenon was called 'adaptive response'. No
response was obtained when the time span between the adaptive and
challenge dose exceeded 4 h, when chloramphenicol was applied between
these 2 doses or when the adaptive dose was too high (chendel et al.,
1978).<p>

The aim of the experiments reported in this communication was to find
out if a similar 'adaptive response' after MNNG treatment could be
detected also in higher plants. The Arabidopsis assay has been chosen
in acount of the high mutagenic activity of MNNG in this plant species
(Moller and Gichner, 1964), conversely to the negative results in
barley (Ehrenberg and Gichner, 1967) and Tradescantia (Gichner et al.,
1982).<p>

MATRIAL AND METHODS<p>

Dry seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana, race Dijon, were aerobically
treated for 36 h at 25*degrees*C in Petri dishes with blotting paper
wetted with low 'conditioning' doses of MNNG (0.005 - 0.03 mM), and
then the seeds were exposed to a high 'challenge' dose of MNNG (0.5 -
2 mM) for 3 h at 25*degrees*C. MNNG (Koch-Light Lab., England) was
dissolved in 0.05 M citratephosphate buffer (pH 5.5). For the
estimation of the mutation frequency and the degree of sterility the
methods developed by A.J. Moller (1963, 1964) were employed. Three
siliquae from 100 plants, i.e., 300 M 1 siliquae were scored in each
treatment. The mutation frequency was expressed by the percentage of M
1 siliquae segregating for embryonic and chlorophyll mutations. The
potentiation factor was defined as the ratio of the effect of the
combined 'conditioning' and 'challenge' treatment minus the effect of
the 'conditioning' effect alone to the effect of the 'challenge'
treatment. It was calculated from the values of M 1 siliquae
segregating mutations. A potention factor of 1 corresponds to nil
potentiating effect.<p>

Table 1: The mutagenic activity of N-methyl-N'nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine
(MNNG) in Arabidopsis thaliana. Treatment conditions: Seeds treated
for 36 h at 25*degrees* with low 'conditioning' doses of MNNG and then
for 3 h at 25*degrees*C with high 'challenge' doses of MNNG.<p>

RESULTS<p>

As demonstrated in Table 1, an 'adaptive response' similar to that
found in bacteria, has not been observed in the present experiments.
On the contrary, pretreatment by low doses of MNNG strongly
potentiated in some cases the mutagenic effects of the 'challenge'
doses. The 'conditioning' treatments included both doses which alone
increased significantly the mutation frequency (e.g., the dose of 0.03
with 0 mM inducing 16.7% segregating M 1 siliquae) and treatments
having a small or nil effect was more pronounced at higher
'conditioning' doses and less manifested by the 0.005 mM MNNG
pretreatment. The potentiation was further absent or comparatively low
when the 'challenge' doses were high (2 mM; 1.5 mM MNNG).<p>

No explanation of the potentiation capability of the 'conditioning'
doses of MNNG can be given. However, the repair processes becoming
inhibited by the 'conditioning' treatments, could be considered.<p>
