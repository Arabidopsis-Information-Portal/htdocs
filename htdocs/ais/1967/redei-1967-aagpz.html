	Arabidopsis contains at least three enzymes capable of digestion of RNA.  The nonparticulate cytoplasm contains an acidic ribonuclease, the organelle fraction harbors a neutral ribonuclease.  These are genuine ribonucleases producing 3'-monophosphates of purines and pyrimidines through 2': 3' cyclic phosphates.  In addition, a phosphodiesterase occurs both in the soluble cytoplasm and in the particulate fractions. This latter enzyme yields nucleoside-5'-phosphates.<p>

	Distribution and activity of these enzymes among the cellular protein fractions is indicated below. The data do not give information on the absolute amount of RNase in these fractions.<p>
