The genetic determination of flowering time in Arabidopsis has been
studied in several papers (HARER, 1951; NAPP-ZINN, 1957; DIERKS, 1958;
SEYFERT, 1964; Van der VEEN, 1965) which discovered some corresponding
features (e.g., dominant alleles for late flowering and presence of
gene interactions).  But none of these investigations led to general
conclusions neither about the number of factors controlling this
character nor about the way of their activity.  Each author chose only
relatively few forms and the possiblility of comparison is lacking.
For this reason, it is yet unknown whether there are few or many
different genes for early vs.later flowering.<p>

In our Department the genetic variability of this character is studied
in natural populations (CETL, DOBROVOLNA, and EFFMERTOVA, 1969).
Besides of breeding experiments with natural forms it is necessary to
include corresponding analytical crossings.  Three years ago, we
carried out a model experiment with the aim to indicate a suitable
system of genetic analyses making possible the inclusion of a large
number of genotypes.  This system is based (1) on crosses of many
genotypes with a common tester line and (2) on diallel crosses in
smaller groups according to the results of the forementioned crosses.<p>

In this paper, some conclusions of experiment (1) are given.  I
studied early and medium late lines isolated in 1963 from three
different natural populations and autogamized from three to five
generations. From these, 16 apparently homozygous lines were chosen
and crossed with the line S 96 (an early segregant from the cross
Dijon x Li-2 obtained by Van der VEEN, 1965).  This line is highly
uniform, it reaches the physiological limit of earliness and it seems
not to contain any known dominant gene for late flowering. The
experiment was carried out under controlled experimental conditions
securing an expressive delay of flowering, in forms with vernalization
requirement.  (For technical details see CETL, RELICHOVA-DOBROVOLNA,
and KRSKOVA, 1970.)  Mean number of days to appearance of flower
primordia (x) mean number of rosette leaves (y) and mean combined
score (x+y) with corresponding distributions were studied in both
parents, in the F1 and the F2. The studied lines were taken as
mothers, the line S 96 as father.<p>

The 16 lines showed different behaviour as to dominance.  For example,
in the number of days to appearance of flower primordia 3 lines showed
dominance, 2 partial dominance and 1 recessivity of the later
flowering while in 0 lines the F1 means were significantly higher than
those of the maternal line.  One line was not different from S 96.<p>

In the F2, in 11 lines very late flowering plants appeared, the
majority of which was found to be segregating for late and early in
the F3.<p>

We initially expected that it should be possible to study the
segregation in the F2 by analyzing the positions of individual peaks
on the distribution curves and to search in this way for corresponding
segregation ratios. But in most of the cases, the distributions were
multimodel, often with larger number of undefinable peaks.<p>

The detailed study of all these phenomena is underway.<p>
