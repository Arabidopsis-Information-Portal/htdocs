ption & Details A post-doctoral associate position to study the role 
of miRNAs and auxin signaling during symbiotic nodule development is 
available in the Department of Plant Science (Sen Subramanian's lab) at 
South Dakota State University, Brookings, SD. Species-specific association 
between legumes and rhizobia bacteria leads to the development of 
nitrogen-fixing root nodules. The role of miRNA-regulated auxin signaling in 
nodule development is largely unknown (See Subramanian et al. 2008 BMC 
Genomics 9: 160; Simon et al. 2009 Plant Physiol). Dr. Subramanian's lab< 
http://www.sdstate.edu/ps/faculty/senthil-subramania/> is interested in 
understanding this process using a combination of genomic and molecular 
approaches. The position offers excellent opportunities for training in 
plant-symbiont interactions, hormone physiology, molecular biology, 
microscopy and genomics. 

MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS: 
A recent Ph.D. degree in plant science or related area, be self-motivated 
with experience in common molecular biology techniques (gene cloning, vector 
construction, quantitative PCR, plant RNA isolation etc), have the ability 
to perform laboratory experiments in an organized manner, be efficient in 
proper documentation of results and be able to communicate well in English. 

PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS: 
Experience in in situ hybridization, site-directed mutagenesis and laser 
micro-dissection are preferred, but not required. SDSU's research facilities 
include a functional genomics core, micro-imaging facility with confocal and 
laser micro-dissection scopes. Other opportunities available for career 
enhancement include training in undergraduate mentoring, scientific writing, 
and research presentations.
