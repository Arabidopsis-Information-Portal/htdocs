<H2>Session 11: RESPONSE TO ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS AND PATHOGENS 1</H2>

This first session on environmental and pathogen stress 
responses of
Arabidopsis focused on the regulation of gene expression 
in Arabidopsis
exposed to various abiotic stresses such as ozone, UV-irradiation, 
touch,
cold and anoxia.  The results presented continued a 
theme that has been
developing over the past several years, namely, that 
different stress
responses appear to be regulated by overlapping and 
interacting signal
transduction pathways.<P>

Keith Davis (The Ohio State University) described the 
response of
Arabidopsis to ozone exposure and presented evidence 
that the pattern of
gene expression observed in ozone-treated plants overlapped 
significantly
with the pattern of gene expression observed during 
a hypersensitive
response.  Studies using virulent and avirulent bacterial 
strains
demonstrated that ozone did induce an active defense 
response capable of
restricting bacterial growth in infiltrated leaves. 
 A rapid accumulation
of salicylic acid was correlated with ozone-induced 
gene expression,
suggesting that salicylic acid may be involved in the 
signal transduction
pathway leading to gene activation.  A similar requirement 
for salicylic
acid production has been shown for pathogen induced 
gene expression.
Further studies using transgenic plants expressing salicylic 
hydroxylase
showed the inhibition of salicylic acid accumulation 
prevented the
ozone-induced accumulation of both PR1 and GST mRNAs, 
whereas PAL mRNA
induction was normal.  A model was presented suggesting 
that there are at
least 2 distinct, interacting signal transduction pathways 
are triggered by
ozone exposure and that salicylic acid is a component 
of one of these
pathways.  <P>

Anne Britt (University of California, Davis) provided 
an interesting
overview of the changes in UV-irradiation that are expected 
to occur should
the protective ozone layer continue to be degraded, 
and how these changes
may affect plants with respect to DNA damage; there 
does not appear to be
much to worry about.  Recent results from the Britt 
laboratory indicate
that there is an active, light dependent repair pathway 
for UV-induced
photoproducts and that it possible to isolate mutants 
deficient for this
repair pathway.  Preliminary studies indicate that a 
second pathway for the
repair of cyclobutyl dimers is present and may be most 
active on actively
transcribed DNA sequences.<P>

In a poster talk, Kathleen Smith (Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology)
also discussed DNA repair and the possible function 
of a novel Arabidopsis
gene, RAD51.  RAD51 is a homolog of the yeast ScRAD51 
gene and the
bacterial RecA gene, and thus may be involved in the 
repair of double
strand breaks in the genome.  RAD51 transcripts were 
found at very low
levels in most tissues, with the highest levels observed 
in flowers and
young seedlings.  RAD51 mRNA was rapidly and strongly 
induced by exposure
of gamma-irradiation in a dose-dependent manner.  Interestingly, 
2 mutants
which are hypersensitive to gamma-irradiation do not 
exhibit the induction
of RAD51 in response to irradiation, thus supporting 
the suggestion that
Arabidopsis RAD51 may be involved in DNA repair.<P>

Mike Thomashow (Michigan State University) provided 
an overview of the
mechanism of cold acclimation in plants, and how Arabidopsis 
has proven to
be a useful model for studying this rather poorly understood 
phenomenon. 
One particularly controversial issue has been whether 
cold acclimation
involves the action of genes that encode cryoprotective 
polypeptides. 
Thomashow presented results in support of this notion. 
 In particular, he
and his colleagues established that the cold-regulated 
COR15a gene of
Arabidopsis encodes a polypeptide that is targeted to 
the stromal
compartment of chloroplasts and found that constitutive 
expression of the
COR15a gene results in the enhancement of chloroplast 
freezing tolerance in
non-acclimated plants.  Whether the COR15a polypeptide 
acts directly as a
cryoprotectant remains to be established.  However, 
results obtained in
collaboration with Peter Steponkus (Cornell University) 
suggest the
possibility that the COR15a polypeptide inhibits freeze-induced 
membrane
fusion.  Thomashow also presented data indicating that 
the COR15a gene has
a cold-regulated promoter that functions in both Arabidopsis 
 and tobacco,
a chilling-sensitive plant that does not cold acclimate. 
Temperature
regulation is imparted by a cis-acting element, termed 
a DRE or C-box, that
also imparts drought-regulated gene expression.  Nuclear 
extracts prepared
from both cold-acclimated and non-acclimated Arabidopsis 
plants contain a
protein(s) that binds to the C-box.  Efforts to clone 
the protein(s) that
binds to the C-box are in progress.<P>

Janet Braam (Rice University) gave an animated and rapid 
summary of her
groups efforts to characterize the regulation and function 
of the 'touch'
(TCH) genes.  Highlights included the determination 
that a subset of the
touch genes are induced by cold shock and that changes 
in cytoplasmic
calcium levels may be involved in this induction.  Further 
studies of the
previously isolated TCH3 and TCH4 genes revealed that 
TCH3, a putative
calcium-binding protein, accumulates during development 
at sites that may
be under mechanical stress or that are undergoing expansion. 
 TCH4 appears
to encode a xyloglucan endotransglycosylase (XET), and 
as such, may have an
important role in modifying the cell wall during responses 
to environmental
stimuli and during development.  TCH4 appears to be 
a member of a large
gene family, opening up the possibility for the differential 
regulation of
XETs in response to a number of environmental or developmental 
cues. 
Further studies of this interesting gene family will 
no doubt provide
insight into the mechanisms controlling cell wall modifications 
and how
these modifications affect plant structures.<P>

And last, but not least, a poster talk by John Sedbrook 
(University of
Wisconsin) summarized work from Patrick Masson's laboratory 
on the plant
response to anoxia.  This group has utilized transgenic 
Arabidopsis plants
expressing AEQUORIN, a sensitive monitor for changes 
in free calcium
levels, to examine the potential role of calcium in 
regulating the changes
in gene expression associated with anoxia.  AEQUORIN-expressing 
Arabidopsis
seedlings developed a biphasic luminescence response 
in cotyledons and
leaves, but not in roots nor hypocotyls.  This luminescence 
response was
composed of a fast and transient first peak which occurred 
within minutes
of anoxia, followed by a second prolonged luminescence 
response which lasts
1.5 to 4 hours.  The calcium channel blockers Gd3+ and 
ruthenium red
partially inhibit the first response, suggesting that 
the calcium
originates from both intracellular and extracellular 
stores.  In contrast,
Gd3+ and ruthenium red promoted a larger and earlier 
second response,
suggesting different mechanisms for these responses. 
 Upon return to
normoxia, the luminescence of cotyledons and leaves 
quickly drops, before
the luminescence transiently increases in all plant 
organs.  The Gd3+,
La3+, EGTA, and ruthenium red-sensitivity of this normoxia-induced 
calcium
response is consistent with it being associated with 
the formation of
oxygen free radicals, thus adding anoxia as yet another 
stress that may
utilize active oxygen species as signal molecules.<P>
