BACKGROUND<p>

The progress and efficiency of molecular biology and biotechnology
during the last years is evident and has been summarized in many
papers. The approach of manipulating the isolated DNA molecule and
single gene copies as well as cell compartments is at present one of
the most exciting field of basic research and technology. However,
some significant problems of application of genomic regeneration and
adaptation from isolated genes, chromosomes and for other cell
constituents have not yet been solved with eukaryotic crop plants
mainly because of their excessive repetitions in DNA-coding and the
lack of constancy and of preservation of manipulated gene sequences.
Nevertheless, the retrospect shows, the key to success in experimental
biology is to choose an adequate model subject for an optimum
technique, likewise in the history of genetics, the pea plant for
factorial, maize for quantitative genetics, Drosophila for mutation,
developmental and population genetics, Neurospora for biochemical
genetics, E. coli for molecualr genetics etc., Thus, it is worth
commenting on how the organization and use of Arabidopsis thaliana
appears to be useful in this context.<p>

It is shown in the following, evidently, present and future problems
of molecular biology and biotechnology mentioned above can only be
solved by use of a plant subject highly adapted both to the new
experimental techniques of DNA-manipulation and to the more
traditional methods of genetics.<p>

GENETIC RESOURCES<p>

To study the procedure for the selection of such an optimum model
plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, which is a small annual cruciferous weed
naturally distributed mainly in Europe, set an excellent example.
Several advantages, given below, make this plant, nicknamed "Botanical
Drosophila", an effective tool for studying the principles of
exploration and conservation of genetic resources in a gene bank for
cooperative research:<p>

a) One of the lowest DNA content of the genome among higher plants (2
pg or 70 000 kb/genome) with very low number of repetitive sequences
(600 dispersed repeats of 125 kb/single copy)<p>

b) Extremely small nuclear volume (30 micro m 3, C = 2 x 10 9
nucleotides).<p>

c) Low chromosome number (2n = 10), and number of linkage groups (5).<p>

d) Stable auto-tetraploids and primary trisomics.<p>

e) Low number of genetically effective cells in seed embryo.<p>

f) Short life cycle of one month at a minimum.<p>

g) Self-fertility with low outcrossing, ranging from 10E-4M to 10E-3M.<p>

h) Tiny seeds (20 mg pr 1000) with an output per plant of 5 x 10 3 to
10 4.<p>

i) Low sensitivity for X-rays (16 kR for imbibed and 60 kR for dry
seeds) and chemomutagens (500 mM for EMS and 10E-4 for nucleic acid
analogues).<p>

k) Several hundeds each of mutant lines and wild ecotypes conserved in
seed banks (FRG, NL, USA, USSR).<p>

l) Easy cultivation in earth (pods), synthetic agar or liquid media
(test tubes) on small areas (up to 5 x 10 4 seedlings per m2).<p>

m) Routinely regeneration from callus cultures.<p>

n) Excellent host to Agrobacterium tumefaciens and cauliflower mosaic
virus.<p>

o) Reliable test subject for environmental toxins.<p>

Such advantages have been used for efficient and economic studies
since they will not or will only in part, be met in especially higher
plants. Conclusively, studies with Arabidopsis indicate the optimum
stategy for an improved experimental design with other plants. In this
respect, original results, conclusions and recommendations have been
made with Arabidopsis for important fields of plant biology and
breeding for instance:<p>

a) genetic material and information transfer (Meyerowitz and Pruitt,
1985; Koornneef et al., 1983)<p>

c) gene function and regulation (Somerville et al., 1985; Ogren et
al., 1984; Meinke, 1985)<p>

d) radio- and chemomutagenesis (Kranz, 1984; Redei et al., 1980;
Dellaert, 1980)<p>

e) cell and tissue culture (Negrutiu and Jacobs, 1977; Keathly and
Scholl, 1983)<p>

f) quantitative and biochemical population studies (Maluszynski et
al., 1985; Cetl et al., 1985)<p>

Recently, a great deal of activity has been published on Arabidopsis
Molecular Biology (cf. C.R. Somerville (ed) Abstr. 3rd Int. Meet.
Arabid. MSU, East Lansing, USA, 1987) the major areas under discussion
were:<p>

. Transformation of Arabidopsis by Agrobacterium<p>

. Suitable Arabidopsis lines for genetic manipulation<p>

. The molecular architecture of Arabidopsis genes<p>

Key issues in transformation are target tissue, strains of
Agrobacterium used and appropriateness of various selectable markers.
Despite the progress in this area, for the Arabidopsis system it has
to be cleared to be as simple as traansformation systems in
Solanaceous species. A comparison of rapid cycling Brassica lines was
made with Arabidopsis, however, Arabidopsis remains a genetic paradigm
in plant biology. For particular applications there is no more
excellent system than mutagenized Arabidopsis as illustrated by the
chlorsulfuron-resistant line having a mutant Agrobacterium vector, and
transferred to tobacco it is an eminent example of the power of use of
Arabidopsis to link classical and molecular genetics. Additionally,
the very small genome size of 70,000 kb and relative low proportion of
repeated DNA sequences (about 25% of the genome), although a tandemly
repeated DNA unit of 180 bp exists, shows the simplicity and
suitability of Arabidopsis for molecular genome organizations studies.<p>

AIS GENE BANK<p>

Evidently, the outstanding suitability of Arabidopsis would have never
been obtained without the use of the first seed bank originally
established by F. Laibach, Frankfurt am Main about 50 years ago which
was later extended with numerous mutant lines at Gottingen by G.
Robbelen, and during the last two decades improved again at Frankfurt
by the author. In the meantime additional mutant collections with more
than 500 lines have been obtained by several workers, but only certain
groups of the mutants have been characterized in detail. The
variability induced and selected by mutant breeding which is conserved
in the Arabidopsis Information Service seed bank (Kranz and Kirchheim,
1987) can be classified as follows:<p>

a) Developmental mutants with incomplete morphogenesis, stopped at
different stages of the embryo or seedling development.
Photomorphogenesis under control of phytochrome is involved in some of
them.<p>

b) "Form"-mutants with altered leaf, stem, flower, fruit and stem
morphology; e.g., spooned, narrow, broad, dentate, haried, glabrous
leaves; bushy, fasicated, abnormal ramified stems; male sterile,
apetal, double flowers; yellow, grayish, brown seeds.<p>

c) Leaf-colour-mutants from lethal pure white, pale yellow (albina,
xantha) over more or less sublethal yellow, golden or orange (lutea,
aurea) to vital green-yellow (chlorina, flavoriridis) plants with
abnormal chlorophyll and carotenoids. Others are at least two-coloured
(maculata, striata, marginata, costata), or change their colour during
development (albescens, xanthescens, lutescens, aurescens,
chlorescens).<p>

d) Biochemical mutants with defective nutrient supply (auxotrophy) for
certain amino acids (thiamin, pyrimidine), sugars (fructose), nitrate
(chlorate resistant), phytohormones (gibberellic acid, 2.4-D
resistant) and certain membrane lipids (3-trans-hexadecenoate).<p>

e) Marker lines and Trisomic lines iwth 10 to 20 genes mapped for each
of the 5 linkage groups (rsp. chromosomes).<p>

In this context an integral aspect worked out with the Arabidopsis
seed bank material should be discussed. The mutation spectrum,
although many parts and functions of the plant are concerned, is
rather peculiar in comparison with the morphological and ecological
variability of about 400 populations of different ecological habitat
collected and studied by the author.<p>

Though in self-fertile Arabidopsis homozygosity of natural populations
is high and comparable with pure lines, we may question the reasons
for this difference. Is it due to the variant genetic background
and/or the different selection pressure?<p>

Obviously, the induced mutations are predominantly monogenic; the
number of double mutations is less in Arabidopsis. But complex
pleiotropic effects of the mutated loci as well as radiation-induced
polygenic mutation of quantitative characters have been observed. The
alternatives are the following:<p>

a) The expression of the phenotypic characters is more quantitative
for the populations, more qualitative for the mutant<p>

b) The number of heterozygous loci is higher for the first, lower for
the second.<p>

c) The origin of the plants is to some extent polyparental in
populations, but strictly monoparental in mutants<p>

d) The selective pressure in the populations favours the
heterozygotes, but in the mutant only the homozygote<p>

e) The adaptation to variant environmental conditions is broad in the
first, but restricted in the second.<p>

By producing mutant lines, only homozygous genotypes have been
selected; that is, the humanly controlled selective pressure favoured
the mutant phenotype. Generally, in self-fertile only one mutant plant
in M 1 was the ancestor of the line.<p>

In natural populations some plasticity has been found regarding
adaptation to changing ecological conditions of the habitat; this
capacity for adaptation is reduced in pure lines such as mutant lines.
Mutant lines will survive and grow best under specific conditions, the
most extreme example being the nutritionally defective mutants
requiring a particular synthetic nutritional medium.<p>

Population geneticists will say, evolution of the natural genetic
resources is similar to that of sympatric populations, and in the
artificial ones genetic variability equals the behaviour of allopatric
populations. Artificial genetic variants induced by mutations are
random and less limited than the ones of natural populations which
have been selectively screened by the ecological conditions of the
habitat.<p>

Since we are living in an era of gene transfer between foreign DNA,
evidently, both types of variability are indispensable resources in
genetic research and plant breeding and, thus, will contribute in one
way or another to further evolution of productivity in crop plants.
The international activities promoted by FAO for gene conservation
include only crop plant for man's food supply (Plucknett, et al.,
1987). However, it is time to start similar activities with
indispensable subjects for basic research programs.<p>

INFORMATION EXCHANGE<p>

Though the First International Symposium on Arabidopsis Research has
been organized in 1965, the experience of the following years has
shown that it was necessary to establish an additional forum for
contact in Arabidopsis research that is in permanent action and less
expensive to all participants than international meetings organized in
short periods. Therefore the newsletter "Arabidopsis Information
Service" (AIS) has been introduced and edited at first by G. Robbelen.
In 1973 its edition and the seed collection was handed over to the
author who set up the secretariate of the Arabidopsis Information
Service at the University of Frankfurt, the place where the
Arabidopsis reearch started 50 years ago. In the meantime, the
activity of this institution extended improving the gene bank exchange
and promoting up to date research information by use of the 24 volumes
of AIS newsletter presently edited; they provide an international
forum for the publication and discussion of current research news,
especially in genetics, but also ecology, taxonomy, development,
physiology, biochemistry, molecular and space biology. AIS is also
open to all informaton on stocks lists, methods, and to laboratory
research communications dealing with tentative experimental results
and research programs underway. Running lists are compiled on the
bibliography on living collections of both natural population and
mutant lines and on addresses of the laboratories working with
Arabidopsis around the world. The number of scientific publications on
Arabidopsis stored in the AIS-Bibliography reaches 2000. Presently, on
the mailing list of the newsletter about 350 addresses are stored;
gene bank material has been mailed in '84 to 62, in '85 to 120 and in
'86 to 360 receivers which shows the increasing interest of
Arabidopsis mainly in the USA (36.0%), EG (35.0%), and Comecon
(20.0%).<p>

Additionally, meetings have been organized by AIS and the author at
Frankfurt (Main) and during the International Congresses of Botany
(Leningrad) and the International Genetic Congresses (Moscow, Delhi).
This year Third International Meeting on Arabidopsis Research
excellently organized by C.R. Somerville at MSU, East Lansing, MI,
bringing together nearly 300 active experimenters mostly from the
United States and the Special Interest Group Meeting of the XIV. IBC,
Berlin are best evidences that Arabidopsis has arrived on the center
stage of scientific interest.<p>
