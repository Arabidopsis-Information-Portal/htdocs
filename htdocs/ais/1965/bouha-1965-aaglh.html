Vol 01S: <h2>Fertility Studies in Polyploid Arabidopsis thaliana</h2><p>

J. BOUHARMONT<p>

The tetraploid and hexaploid forms induced by colchicine in
Arabidopsis thaliana have a rather high seed fertility. They produce
numerous pods and their seed setting is good. Indeed the number of
viable seeds is notably lower than in diploid plants, but that
reduction is partly concealed by the larger size of the seeds. The
following table gives the principal characteristics of the three
forms: (1) flowering date, (2) weight of 1000 seeds, (3) pollen grain
diameter, (4) pollen fertility, (5) number of viable seeds per pod,
(6) number of degenerated seeds, (7) total number of seeds, (8)
percentage of viable seeds:<p>

These characteristics are those of most autoploid plants: later
flowering (chiefly in hexaploids), heavier seeds, larger pollen
grains.  Pollen fertility is lower than in diploids, but the
difference is not large. The total number of seeds per pod, counted in
half developed fruits, is strongly reduced in both polyploid forms. On
the other hand, degenerated seeds are few in diploid Arabidopsis and
more frequent in polyploid plants.<p>

Observations were made in order to elucidate the origin of the
reduction of seed setting in polyploid plants. The material (flowers
and young pods) was fixed in CRAF, microtomed at 10 *micro* and
stained with iron haematoxylin. Pollen grains were observed in
aceto-carmine and stigmata were stained in acid fuchsin after clearing
in lacto-phenol.<p>

The differentiation of the embryo sac is very rapid in Arabidopsis and
takes place a little before fertilization: generally it is not
completed in the ovules lying at the upper part of the ovary while the
lower ovules are already fertilized. Mature embryo sacs contain two
synergids and the egg cell at the micropylar end, three partly
degenerated antipdals at the opposite end and two polar nuclei lying
in the neighbourhood of the egg (Figure 1). These polar nuclei are
often fused before fertilization. The pollen tube goes through one of
the synergids, one male nucleus fuses with the egg and the other with
the secondary nucleus. The primary endosperm nucleus divides very soon
after fertilization and the zygote does a little later.<p>

The first cell wall in the zygote is transverse; the basal cell gives,
after several other transversal divisions, six to eight suspensor
cells. The apical cell gives rise to the major part of the embryo; its
first two divisions are longitudinal. After the quadrant stage,
transversal walls divide the four cells in eight octants and the
following mitoses give a larger embryo. The first stages of
embryogenesis, and especially the orientation of the cell plates agree
to the previous observations in Cruciferae (VANDENDRIES, 1909;
JOHANSEN, 1950; MAHESHWARY, 1950).<p>

In diploid plants, some ovuls, generally lying at the upper end of the
ovary, do not develop completely and others, with normal embryo sacs,
do not become fertilized, but we did not find embryo sacs with
aberrant nuclear content nor irregular development of embryo and
endosperm. Undeveloped and unfertilized ovules disappear rapidly and
are no longer seen in the mature fruit.<p>

In polyploid plants, incompletely differentiated embryo sacs are
probably more frequent than in diploid ones. These embryo sacs are
often collapsed at flowering. Observations on meiosis in tetraploid
ovules and anthers have shown rather frequent occurrence of anaphase
bridges which may explain the failure of these embryo sacs and the
reduced pollen fertility.<p>

Normal but unfertilized ovules are more numerous; their number is
variable from flower to flower and, in some ovaries, they are more or
less gathered. Preliminary counting made in deploid and tetraploid
flowers gave the same average number of ovules (44) at the early
stages of megasporogenesis. Therefore the difference between the total
numbers of seeds in diploid and polyploid developing pods appears to
be the result of the failure of ovules after meiosis and of the
presence of unfertilized ovules which degenerate rapidly after
flowering. This second factor seems more imporant than the first.<p>

Another type of ovules was found in polyploids, chiefly in
tetraploids, and not in diploids: the nuclei of their embryo sacs were
irregular in size, number of distribution. When the number of nuclei
was high, it was sometimes possible to discern the presence of two
gametophytes more or less differentiated and merged. In hexaploid
plants, we found three embryo sacs containing three polar nuclei
instead of two; these nuclei were not completely fused and their
nucleoli were as large as usual (other nucleoli of the embryo sac are
smaller). These gametophytes had three partly degenerated antipodals,
an egg cell and two synergids, but one of the synergids was smaller
and anucleate (Figure 2). Then that anomaly was the result of an
irregular migration of a nucleus during the embryo sac
differentiation. Another ovule contained four polar nuclei (or at
least four nucleoli), but its constitution was not so clear because of
the more advanced development of the flower: it was nevertheless
possible to find the remannts of three antipodals and an egg, but no
trace of synergids was visible (Figure 3).<p>

A morphological difference appears between diploid and polyploid
Arabidopsis. In diploid flowers, the stigma is covered by rather long
papillae. In polyploids, the elongation of epidermal cells is more
variable and generally less important: the stigmatic surface is often
very small. The number of pollen grains shed on the stigma is variable
but it is possible that the small size of the stigmatic cells may
reduce the effectiveness of pollination in some polyploid flowers.  We
had already observed a similar reduction of the stigmatic size after
chromosome doubling in Crotolaria goreensis (BOUHARMONT, 1961).<p>

After fertilization, the development of the embryo is regular in the
majority of the hexaploid ovules, but a little deviation was sometimes
found in the orientation of the cell walls in the apical cells of the
proembryo. After a normal longitudinal division, the following cell
plate was sometimes transversal in one of the daughter cells, and
longitudinal in the other: that was observed in three ovules, while
the quadrant stage was normal in eight embryos. In one last embryo,
the cell walls were transversal in both daughter cells (Figures 4-6).
On the other hand, the orientation of the cell walls was regular in 29
diploid and 11 tetraploid embryos observed at the quadrant stage.<p>

Other iregularities were found during the early development of
fertilized ovules, but rarely. In tetraploid form, one of them
contained an irregularly shaped embryo and endosperm nuclei of
variable size; another showed no embryo, but the endosperm was well
developed and dividing.<p>

The failure of fertilized ovules is rare in diploids, more frequent in
hexaploids and chiefly in tetraploids. In the well developed pods,
these seeds remain small, they are yellow or brown and shrivelled.
Observed in sections, they always contained a more or less
differentiated embryo; endosperm was little developed but obvious in
some seeds, absent or perhaps degenerated in other ones (Figures 7-8).
The size of the seeds and embryos in young pods is more irregular in
polyploid than in diploid plants: beyond aborted ovules, there are
some little developed seeds with small embryos, which seem
nevertheless about to reach maturity (Figure 9).<p>

In conclusion, it appears that the reduction of the number of seeds in
the pods of tetraploid and hexaploid Arabidopsis proceeds from several
causes acting from megasporogenesis up to the development of the seed.
The most important cause is the reduced fertilization; other ones are
the failure of embryo sacs before flowering and the death of young
seeds after fertilization. The partial pollen sterility has no direct
effect. The primary origin of the failure of ovules and seeds may be
the occurrence of aneuploid gametes after irregular megasporogenesis.
Nevertheless meiotic anamolies are not the only factor and perhaps not
the principal one as indicated by the regular size and shape of young
microspores, the low pollen and embryo sac sterility and the absence
of aneuploid progenies. Physiological disturbance in polyploid cells
is probably another cause of the fertility reduction. Aberrant
development of some embryo sacs and embryos does not interfere with
the seed production, but it is an indication of a physiological
unbalance.  Another indication is the smaller and variable development
of the stigmatic cells in polyploid flowers.<p>

Discussion:<p>

REDEI: What kind of micro-technic did you use?<p>

BOUHARMONT: The whole ovaries and fruits were fixed in
NAVASHIN-RANDOLPH (CRAF: chromic acid, acetic acid, formaldehyde) with
saponin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned lengthwise and stained in
HEIDENHAIN haematoxylin; observations and photomicrographs were made
with ZEISS Ultraphot.<p>

REDEI: You have shown some eggs which had two nuclei, apparently this
should give rise to fused nuclei and result in diploid eggs.<p>

BOUHARMONT: On that slide two nuclei lie at the normal site of the egg
cell, but I cannot say, if both are really egg nuclei, because polar
nuclei are not present in that gametophyte. On the other hand, the
fused nuclei you have seen were only polar ones.<p>

REDEI: It would be interesting to see the progeny, when you get seeds
from such diploid eggs. Their frequency would be estimated by
phenotype since triploids are morphologically different.<p>

BOUHARMONT: That kind of embryo sac, however, is very rare: I have
found it only once or twice. Moreover, these ovules are probably
sterile since their embryo sacs show other anomalies.<p>

REINHOLZ: On a figure you have shown two well developed embryos and a
small one. Would you assume that the small embryo is lagging but not
abnormal?<p>

BOUHARMONT: That small embryo and ovule could probably give a fertile
seed, because in polyploid pods there are often very small seeds which
germinate.<p>

ROBBELEN: Did you prove, whether these small embryos are polyhaploids?<p>

BOUHARMONT: In the progenies of tetraploid plants, these seedlings
would be diploid. But I have never found diploid offspring from
tetraploid plants. Nevertheless it is possible that tetraploid
seedlings appear in the offspring of octoploid plants.<p>

KRANZ: Did you find aneuploids in the progeny of polyploids?<p>

BOUHARMONT: I have not counted the chromosomes in progenies, but there
were no highly sterile plants which would be aneuploid.<p>
