	As a precursory to experiments on radiation mutagenesis in Arabidopsis certain dose-response relationships for survival in successive stages of plant development and for fertility were studied.<p>

	Air-dry seeds (about 5% water content) of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) HEYNH., race Enkheim, stored at room temperature for 2 to 4 months after harvest, were irradiated with various doses of 60Co gamma-rays (10, 20, 40, 70, 110, 160, 220, and 290 kR) at a dose rate of about 3.7 kR per minute, and then planted immediately into test tubes containing usual mineral nutrient agar; no cold treatment was employed.  The following growth conditions were kept:  photoperiod 20 hrs light (fluorescent tubes) plus 4 hrs darkness; temperature about 25*degrees*C in the light and 19*degrees*C in the dark; relative air humidity about 80%.  Fourty seeds were sown per dose level in each of five independent replicated experiments with the plants in randomized blocks. The data on plant survival in successive growth stages were based on weekly phaenological records, and those on fertility on respective daily harvest records and seed counts.  Methods of analysis of variance were applied to the obtained results.<p>

	The data on plant survival and fertility, presented in the table below, may be briefly summarized as follows:  (a) seed germination (total percentage, but not the germination rate) was not inhibited by gamma-irradiation within the studied dose range; (b) plant lethality occurred mainly in the cotyledon and rosette stages; (c) completely sterile plants were found among survivors at doses of 40 kR and higher, and (d) regular decrease in mean number of seeds per fertile plant was observed in the entire dose range studied.<p>

	On applying analysis of variance to the obtained data, it was found that, even within relatively narrow limits of fluctuation of environmental conditions, the expression of a number of characters of plant survival and fertility as well as of growth and development was considerably variable, especially if some not-extreme effects of irradiation (e.g., growth and/or development inhibition) were studied.<p>
