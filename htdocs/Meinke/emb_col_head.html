<ul>
<li><strong>Mutant:</strong> Name of mutant locus. </li>
<li><strong>Mutagen:</strong> Agent used to induce mutations. </li>
<li><strong>Eco:</strong> Ecotype. COL = Columbia; WS = Wassilewskija. </li>
<li><strong>Tag:</strong> T-DNA tagging status. Y = tagged; N = not tagged; U = unresolved; NAP = not 
applicable. </li>
<li><strong>Class:</strong> Initial classification based on appearance of mutant embryos at maturity. P = 
preglobular; G = globular; T = transition; C = cotyledon; F = fusca; O = other. </li>
<li><strong>Seed/Embryo:</strong> Color of mutant seeds and embryos prior to desiccation. 1 = white; 2 = pale 
yellow-green; 3 = pale green; 4 = green; 5 = green and dark red. </li>
<li><strong>% m/m:</strong> Percent mutant seeds in heterozygous siliques following self-pollination. </li>
<li><strong>% Top:</strong> Percent total mutant seeds located in top half of silique. A non-random (*) 
distribution of mutant seeds suggests that the mutant allele disrupts pollen development or 
pollen-tube growth. </li>
<li><strong>Linkage:</strong> Chromosome assignment based on mapping with visible markers. [ ] = 
assignment based on mapping other mutant alleles; (-) = results pending; (x) = not included 
in mapping project. </li>
<li><strong>Map:</strong> Chromosome location on updated classical genetic map. </li>
<li><strong>Phenotype:</strong> General appearance of mutant embryos at maturity. </li>
<li><strong>Current:</strong> Current gene symbol. </li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Original seed source. DuPont and Tucson lines were generated by Ken Feldmann. </li>
