<b>THIS PAGE PROVIDES LINKS TO FORMS FOR YOU TO PROVIDE PHYSICAL-MAP
CONTIG INFORMATION TO TAIR.</b>
</center>

<p>

This information may be a simple tiling-path or a more complex map,
which includes some physical relationships. In addition, there are
forms to allow you to provide further details -- hybridization
characterisitics, chimerism, size, etc. -- on individual clones or
probes you have used in your contig. 

<p>

<b>
<center>
Please note, there is a separate form to use if you are providing <a
href="/BAC.html"> BAC
mapping-data</a>.</b>
</center>

<br>

If you already have your data in some sort of <b>computer format</b>,
which you think may obviate the need to complete some of the forms, please <a
href="/contig_info.html#Gotdata">
read this</a> first.<p>


<hr>

The relevant forms are:

<p>

<dl>

<dt><IMG SRC=/images/ball.red.gif
alt="[X]"> <A
HREF="/contig_simplemap.html">
Submit SIMPLE Contig Map Details</a> 

<dd>Use this form if your data are probably best represented as a
tiling path -- as shown in the <a href="#simple">upper figure</a> given below.

<p>

<dt><IMG SRC=/images/ball.red.gif alt="[X]">
<A HREF="/contig_complexmap.html">
Submit COMPLEX Contig Map Details</a>

<dd>Use this form if you have more complex data, which includes the
physical relationship between markers, and you are able to draw a map
to scale -- as shown in the <a href="#detailed">lower figure</a> given
below.  If you fill in this form, you do <b>not</b> need to complete
the previous ("Simple") form too.

<p>

<dt><IMG SRC=/images/ball.red.gif alt="[X]">
<A HREF="/contig_clone.html">
Submit Contig CLONE Details</a>

<dd>Use this form, after you have finished a simple- or complex- map
form, to submit any additional information you may have regarding the
size, type, any chimerism, Southern hybridization pattern, <i>etc.</i>
of an individual clone from your contig. Use a fresh form for each
clone.

<p>

<dt><IMG SRC=/images/ball.red.gif alt="[X]">
<A HREF="/contig_probe.html">
Submit Contig PROBE Details</a>

<dd>Use this form, after you have finished a simple- or complex- map
form, to submit any additional information you may have regarding the
size, type, map position, <i>etc.</i> of an individual probe from your
contig. Use a fresh form for each probe.

Many thanks to Robin Buell (Carnegie, Stanford) for her excellent
advice and the considerable time she gave to help in the design and
testing of the various contig-submission forms. Thanks also to Renate
Schmidt (Max-Delbr&#252;ck-Laboratory, K&#246;ln, Germany) for her
valuable comments.
