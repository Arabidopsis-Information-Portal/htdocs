By means of treating Arabidopsis seeds with X-rays (7 to 28 kr) and
methyl-nitrosourea (MNU) (.04 to .12 mM) high frequency of lethal and
vital chlorophyll and morphological mutants was induced and scored in
M2: 4.5 percent for X-rays and 24.3 percent for MNU when the highest
dose or concentration was used.  Studying individual M1 families in
the M2 we stated that some of them segregate more than one mutant type
(in X-rays up to 3 different mutant types, in MNU even 6), the average
number of mutations per segregating M1 family being 1.88 and 2.34 for
these highest dose and concentration. After RELICHOVA (1972) and
RELICHOVA and CETL (1972) these mutations might be distributed in the
apical initials of the vegetative shoot apex in different ways.
Distingishing between two basic alternatives (i.e. 2/0 and 1/1) is
possible by analysing single M3 families, derived from single M1
individuals (HANSEL, 1967). Table 1 (see page 7) shows some typical
results of this analysis.<p>

In this survey, cases are gien where only two mutations appeared in
the same M1 family as the analysis becomes difficult if more than two
mutations appear in the same M1 fmily.<p>

The frequency of both basic types of distribution (2/0) and (1/1) were
tested.  Complete analyses of M3 showed, that the observed frequency
of real double mutations (i.e. of two mutations in the same initial
cell, (2/0) was twice higher than the other case (1/1). The reason for
this fact may be in the organization of vegetative shoot apex itself.
Many authors report with agreement with our considerations the average
number of initials to be 2 to 3 and the average size of mutated sector
about 30 to 60 percent.  If we take into considerations also the
variable fate of apical initial cells, then, studying a wide spectrum
of mutation types, the number of mutations per one M1 plant is higher
than the number of genetic effective initial cells.  It should mean
that more than one mutation was frequently induced in these cells.<p>
