Some sectors have been subjected to genetic tests.  The progeny of one
yellow green sector (ch1) segregated for gi2 and gi+ but pa was
absent.  Such a phenomenon could be due to somatic recombination at
the four strand stage:<p>

gi2 ch1 and gi+ ch1 were observed in nearly equal number indicating a
lower transmission of the gi+ ch1 strand.  This may be interpreted as
an unequal chromatid exchange.  Though the end result of such a
somatic recombination is similar to that of crossing over, the
mechanism by which this originates is probably different.<p>

Though the appearance of somatic sectors may be due to several causes,
the evidence available may satisfactorily exclude the following
possibilities:<p>

1.  Deficiency of the ch1 - pa region extending to 8 map units may
result in a yellow sector (ch1 uncovered in hemizygous) and would
explain the absence of the pa marker.  If the distance between left
breakage point and gi2 would be 29 m.u., and there would be no
transmission of the defective strand (reasonable for a 8 m.u. long
deficiency) an approximately 1:1 segregation for gi+: gi2 may be
expected as a result of meiotic recombination in the tested progeny.
In the second generation of some of the yellow sector progeny an
abnormal phenotypic ratio of gi+ : gi2 was observed, indicating some
transmission of the affected stand.  Since the actual distance between
gi and ch loci is 24.8 + 1.2 units and the defective strand has some
transmission the hypothesis of claiming a deletion of the whole ch -
pa region appears unwarranted.<p>

2.  Failure of disjunction of sister chromatids before mitotic
anaphase (non-disjunction) may result in ch sectors but in such a case
its progeny should not segregate for markers which were in repulsion
in the original strands.<p>

3.  Translocation of the ch+ pa region to a non-homologous chromosome
which would segregate to the same pole as the non-translocated ch+ pa
strand may result in hemizygosity for ch1, and could produce a yellow-
green segment.  Such translocation results in deficiency as =1, which
has already been discussed.<p>

4.  A forward mutation from ch+ to ch1 and a simultaneously a
reversion from pa to pa+ and in addition the appearance of a factor
causing distorted ratios would explain the observed facts but would
require a coincidence of such a low probability that this hypothesis
can hardly be considered seriously.<p>

Four additional cases under study appear to support the chromatid
exchange interpretation.  Somatic recombination has not been observed
to occur spontaneously.<p>
