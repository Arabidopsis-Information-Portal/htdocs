M.Sc. Position available: ABC transporters in plant secondary metabolism. 
 
A graduate student is sought for a(n) MSc/PhD project under the joint 
supervision of David Bird and Peter Facchini in the Department of 
Biological Sciences at the University of Calgary. The goal of this 
research program is to identify and characterize ABC transporters involved 
in the transport of cuticular lipids and alkaloids in the model plants 
Arabidopsis thaliana and Papaver somniferum, respectively. The goal of the 
Masters project is to identify candidate transporters using comparative 
genomics, bioinformatics, and gene silencing analysis. To be considered, 
the candidate should hold a B.Sc. in Biology, with an emphasis on 
molecular biology or biochemistry. The ideal candidate will hold an 
excellent academic record meeting the requirements for external 
scholarships and will have laboratory experience in biochemistry or 
molecular biology. Interested candidates should contact David Bird 
(dabird@ucalgary.ca) and provide a CV, academic transcripts, and the names 
of two references.
