Among substances related to nucleic acid metabolism, acridine has been
tested for physiological effects in M1 and for mutagenic activity in
M2.  Acridines bind to DNA by intercalation between adjacent base
pairs, and induced phage mutants have been isolated.<p>

We have cultivated plants in dishes on perlite supplemented with 40 ml
of a mineral medium containing 1,25 - 12,5 gamma acridine
(C6H4CH:C6H4:N) per ml under continuous light and a constant
temperature of 25*degrees*C.  The results are the following:<p>

In particular the experiment demonstrated 1) an inhibition of
germination in relation to the concentrations used, 2) a lot of
physiological effects: dwarf plants, rhomboidal rosette leaves,
petioles enlarged, midrib prominent, 3) a lethality very pronounced,
measured at harvesting, and 4) a low seed-set in M1 though seeds were
well developed.  Among 384 M2 seedlings no chlorophyll or
morphological mutants have been detected.  New experiences are now
underway using acriflavine, acridine orange and proflavine.<p>
