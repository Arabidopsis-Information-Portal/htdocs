The efficiency of various mutagenic agents on several recessive leaf
colour mutants of Arabidopsis was tested.  After treatment of mutant
seeds, green sectors within the yellow M1 mutant plants were scored as
"reversions".  The percentage of plants with reversions varied from 0%
to almost 30%, depending on the specific mutant (Table 1).  Equivalent
data were obtained in 3 similar experiments. Thus the reversion
frequency seems to be a characteristic feature of the mutant gene in
question.  Of course, the reversion rate also depends on the treatment
conditions (Table 2).  But, throughout the doses tested, the
difference between mutants, like V 89 and V 157, remains the same.
Even sublethal doses of EMS never yielded as high reversion
frequencies in V89 as in V 157.<p>

In order to determine the genetic nature of the phenotypic reversions,
the sectored M1 plants were grown to maturity and the seeds harvested
from each green sector separately.  The first result was (as
expected), that any of the inflorescences, produced from these
sectors, were completely or partially sterile.  Probably chromosomal
defects were involved in these instances.  On the other hand, sectors
with normal fertility are likely to be less affected by chromosomal
rearrangements.  Those revertant sectors, selected by this means for
structurally normal chromosomes, were futher tested.<p>

In the M2 generation two types of progenies were clearly
distinguishable.  In some instances green wild type and yellow mutant
plants segregated 3:1 indicating that the green M1 sector was
heterozygous for the corresponding locus.  These somatic sectors may
be attributed to "backmutations" (though deletions or closely linked
suppressors are not necessarily excluded).  Within the other kind of
progenies, two types of rosettes, light green and darker ones,
appeared besides the mutant.  As for example in the mutant V 81 the
wild type is fully dominant; the light green plants cannot represent
the heterozygous state of the mutant gene. For further analysis these
intermediate types were crossed to both, the wild type and the
original mutant. Segregation ratios of 1 yellow: 2 light green: 13
green plants indicated, that the sectorial reversion in the M1
resulted from a mutation in a locus, different from the original
mutant one.  In some cross-combinations with the wild type, the F2
even showed 4 phenotypic classes: xa being the mutant locus and S its
suppressor. - In table 3 all these different types of reversions, not
segregating 3:1, are combined as "suppressors".  The table shows, that
the frequency of reverted green sectors, originating from suppressor
mutations, is very high after EMS treatment with less than 10% of
these cases being true backmutations.<p>

Table 3: Genetic analysis of green sectors after 0.2% EMS, 16 h, on
seeds<p>

Eight of the suppressors of the mutant V 81 were intercrossed and all
appeared to be identical.  In 12 test combinations with suppressors of
the mutant V 157, 4 different ones were found; but only one of these
showed linkage to the mutant locus.  To date little is known about
suppressors in higher plants.  By further analyzing the suppressor
situation in leaf colour mutants, we hope to contribute to an
undertanding of gene intraction during chlorophyll synthesis or
chloroplast differentiation.<p>

All of the suppressors, which we obtained thus far, do not fully
revert the mutant to the wild type if in the heterozygous state, and
some suppressors do not even do so in the homozygous condition.  In
Table 4 from the total number of reversions analyzed by progeny tests,
those were noted, that gave complete reversion to wild type.  The
figures in the last column, therefore, are most probably equivalent to
the percentage of backmutations.  In this experiment 3 different
mutagenic treatments were compared.  It is evident from the data, that
EMS, which produced the highest overall number of revertant sectors,
yielded only 1.9% backmutations.  On the other hand, X-rays, despite
their relatively low somatic sectoring, induced a much higher number
of backmutations. With other mutants, the figures may vary somewhat;
but for 3 different mutants tested so far, the tendency was the same.
Accordingly, whenever the action of different mutagenic treatments is
to be analyzed, it appears not to be sufficient to score the number of
somatic sectors only.<p>
