Independent Research Fellowships
The John Innes Centre (JIC), Norwich, UK is a world leading centre of
excellence in plant and microbial sciences based on the Norwich Research
Park. We are inviting applications from outstanding researchers who either
hold, or wish to apply for Independent Research Fellowships, to attend a
Conference at the JIC on 7 June 2010.

At the meeting you will be able to present a talk about your proposed area
of research and to discuss your proposals, the development of your group and
your future career plans in depth with senior JIC Scientists. After the
Conference we will select and mentor outstanding candidates in writing
Fellowship applications and/or offer the opportunity to move existing
Fellowships to the JIC.
