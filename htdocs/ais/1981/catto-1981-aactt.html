INTRODUCTION<p>

The availability of mutants showing biochemical variation would
contribute to the elucidation of fundamental problems in plant
biochemistry and genetics.<p>

For obtention of such mutants the use of "in vitro" culture techniques
was suggested. As the application of these methods permits the
treatment of large numbers of individuals, it should allow the
isolation of broad spectra of mutants using minimal space and effort.
However, although the advantages of "in vitro" culture methods are
still valid, several drawbacks appeared upon use. In some plant
systems they could be advantageously replaced by selection systems on
seedlings.<p>

Arabidopsis is such a system. Until now tissue culture methods
designed for this plant system did not lead to the isolation of a
broad variety of biochemical mutants. Although some variant lines were
obtained resistant to AEC and 5-methyltryptophane the rather long
period in "in vitro" culture, necessary for obtention of good
suspension cultures that could be used for mutagenic treatment and
selection procedures, lead to the disappearance of regeneration
capacity (Negrutiu et al., 1970).<p>

On the other hand the small Arabidopsis seeds, containing only few
nutrients can easily be treated as isolated embryo's. A technique for
screening large numbers of seedlings could be worked out.<p>

In this paper we describe the use of this technique for the isolation
of mutants resistant to analogues of aspartate derived amino acids and
to the growth inhibitory combination of lysine plus threonine.<p>

MATRIALS AND METHODS<p>

Mutagenic Treatment<p>

Seeds of var. Bensheim were treated with 1% EMS during 3 h.
Chlorophyll mutations in M2 seedlings were used as an indication of
treatment efficiency. 1% chlorophyll mutations expressed at the
cotyledon stage were found in the present study.<p>

After a cold treatment (48 h, 4*degrees*C) the seeds were sown
homogeneously in the greenhouse. M2 seeds were harvested in bulk.<p>

Selection Procedure<p>

M2 seeds were sterilized by treatment with acidified calcium
hypochlorite during 30 min. A drop of neutral detergent was added to
the hypochlorite solution as a wetting agent. After rising thoroughly
with sterile water, the seeds were suspended in 0.2% agar (10 mg dry
seeds/ml agar solution).<p>

Two ml of this suspension containing ca. 1000 seeds were spread on top
of a layer of selective medium. After cold treatment (48 h,
4*degrees*C) the petri dishes were incubated at room temperature in a
photoperiod of 16 hours.<p>

Resistant plants were selected after one week on selective medium. The
resistants were transferred to soil and cultivated further.<p>

Selective media<p>

The nutrient medium used was a mineral medium as described by Feenstra
(1964) with 2% glucose added. Inhibitors (amino acids and analogues)
were filter sterilized and added to the autoclaved basal medium.<p>

As growth inhibitors we have used analogues of aspartate derived amino
acids: S-aminomethylcysteine AEC (lysine analogue), ethionine
(methionine analogue) and hydroxynorvaline (threonine analogue). In
each case the reversion of analogue inhibition by natural amino acids
was examined. On the other hand inhibitory combinations of lysine and
threonine were also used and the reversion by addition of methionine
to the medium was tested. When lysine + threonine or AEC were used,
arginine was added to the medium to prevent inhibition by lysine
uncorrelated to regulatory effects on enzymes of the aspartate
biosynthetic pathway (Cattoir-Reynaerts et al., 1980).<p>

RESULTS<p>

1. Determination of inhibitory concentrations of analogues and amino
acids<p>

The results are summarized in Table 1. For each amino acid analogue
reversion of inhibition was obtained by the addition of the
corresponding amino acid. Ethionine inhibition was only partially
reversed by methionine. AEC inhibition was reversed by adding lysine,
lysine + threonine inhibition by adding methionine if arginine is
present in the culture medium.<p>

2. Isolation of resistant mutants<p>

Using the method described in the previous section we have screened
the progeny of 175.000 EMS treated M1 seeds for resistance to lysine +
threonine (1 mM of each) in the presence of arginine (0.5 mM). Six
hundred thousands of M2 seeds were tested. Eighty nine plantlets were
cultivated further. From 75 plantlets M3 seeds were collected. The
others were either sterile or died before maturity. From 52 M3 progeny
retested on selective medium 46 proved to be either homogeneously
resistant (32) or to segregate into resistant and sensitive plants
(14). Six plantlets seemed to be erroneously classified as resistants.
Based on these figures the mutation rate seems to be rather high.
However, it may be overestimated because our test is based on the
assumption that all M1 plants contribute in a similar way to the
production of M2 seeds. In reality this is not the case.<p>

On AEC (0.15 mM) in the presence of 0.5 mM arginine, out of 200.000
tested M2 seedlings 48 plantlets were selected and cultivated further.
Thirty nine M3 progenies were retested on AEC. Twenty six were clearly
resistant. The others were sensitive or only slightly more resistant
than the wild type. Ten M3 progenies were segregating into resistant
and sensitive plantlets, the other 16 were homogeneously resistant.<p>

On hydroxynorvaline (1 mM) no resistant mutants were isolated among
100.000 tested M2 seeds.<p>

On ethionine (0.3 mM) out of 100.000 tested M2 seeds only 10 plantlets
seemed to be resistant and were cultivated further. Only 4 of them
reached maturity and their progeny proved to be fully and
homogeneously resistant to ethionine. This rather low rate of normally
developing plantlets could be due to the fact that most of them seemed
to be only partially resistant. The root system was in most cases only
weakly developed even after a transfer period on nonselective medium.<p>

CONCLUSIONS<p>

Our results prove that using an efficient mutagenic treatment, the
selection of M2 seeds of Arabidopsis lead to the isolation of large
numbers of mutants resistant to various amino acid analogues or
inhibitory amino acid combinations.<p>

Cross resistance studies and genetical analysis should allow to
estimate how many different kinds of mutations could lead to
resistance. The biochemical analysis of different types will lead to a
better knowledge of different aspects of regulation of the aspartate
pathway in higher plants. Furthermore, if the resistance is also
expressed in "in vitro" culture systems, the mutants could be useful
as model system in studies of somatic cell genetics.<p>
