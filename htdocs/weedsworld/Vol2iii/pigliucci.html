<H2>Abstract</H2>


The study of the association between fitness and reaction 
norms is of primary importance given the hypothesized 
role for phenotypic plasticity in shaping evolutionary 
patterns: in microevolution, as one mechanism for maintaining 
genetic variation, and in macroevolution, as a means 
of generating phenotypic novelties. In a glasshouse 
experiment, we investigated variation in reaction norms 
to nutrient availability in populations of Arabidopsis 
thaliana, and the relationship between this variation 
and reproductive fitness. We found evidence for across-treatment 
directional selection on the means for leaf number, 
flowering time, plant height, branching, and growth 
rate; across-treatment stabilizing selection was detected 
for growth rate; and across-treatment disruptive selection 
was significant for leaf number. We also uncovered 
selection on the plasticity of some traits: directional 
for  the plasticity of branching, and stabilizing for 
the plasticity of both branching and growth rate. When 
the two environments were considered separately, directional 
selection for height was detected under low nutrients; 
under high nutrients, we found evidence for directional 
selection on leaf number and height, and for disruptive 
selection on flowering time. The genetic correlation 
between a trait's expression in one environment and 
its expression in the alternate environment was positive 
and highly significant only for flowering time and 
growth rate. A principal components analysis revealed 
possible constraints on future selection responses, 
due to correlations among character means and among 
character plasticities. <P>
