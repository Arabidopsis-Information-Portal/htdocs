A mutant of Arabidopsis, A-154, was previously characterized as being
sensitive to valine and other amino acids (Acedo and Redei, 1976), and
the glutamic acid content was found to be low in the free amino acid
pool (Acedo, 1978). Some metabolites supplied exogenously improved the
growth of the mutant; among these are formate (Acedo, 1980 in this
issue), malate and para-amino-benzoid acid. This paper reports on the
improved growth of mutant A-154 on culture media with low pH, the
possible implications of this effect are also discussed.<p>

The plants were grown aseptically on solid media (Redei, 1962).
Supplements were added and the pH was adjusted prior to autoclaving.
The seeded test tubes were put in the greenhouse for 20-30 days, then
the plants harvested were dried in an oven for 18-24 hours at
85*degrees*C before weighing.<p>

Glutamic acid and casein hydrolyzate which inhibit growth of this
mutant at pH between 5.5 to 6.5 are not inhibitory at pH 4.5 (Table
1). The growth of the wild type, however, is slightly retarded at low
pH.<p>

I suspect that the membrane system of the mutant is probably made more
permeable to some metabolites at pH 4.5. Low pH increased the
availability of iron to soybean plants (Weiss, 1943). Another
possibility is that the low pH directly altered the activity of the
enzymes. Lipoxidase, acid phosphatase, and *beta*amylase were among
the major proteins identified at pH 4.5 on soybean cotyledons
(Catsimpolas and Leuthner, 1969). A definite effect of pH on the
kinetics of catalase-mediated reactions was demonstrated by chance
(1952). In the 'malic' enzyme reaction, the Km for malate is dependent
on pH (Johnson and Hatch, 1970). Valine inhibition of growth in
Salmonella typhimurium is also dependent on pH, the greatest
inhibition is at pH 8.0 (Bauerle et al., 1964).<p>

experiments, each treatment with 20 plants).<p>

The improvement of growth of mutant A-154 in the glutamic
acid-supplemented media could be due to a decreased uptake since this
amino acid is toxic at pH 6.5. With casein hydrolyzate, a selective
permeability to some amino acids nontoxic for growth could have been
favored and the entry of the toxic ones reduced. There is an
established feedback system in this mutant especially in the valine:
isoleucine pathway (Acedo and Redei, 1976) and between threonine and
isoleucine (unpublished data). In both cases isoleucine relieves the
toxic effects of both amino acids. The altered kinetics of some
enzymes, particularly the permeases should also be considered. Many
other possibilities exist, and the actual reaction affected by the low
pH would be an interesting subject for future study.<p>
