<h2> Variability of cell resistance to damage by high hydrostatic pressure in ecological races of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) HEYNH.</h2><p>

It was reported earlier (ASHRAF, 1970a,b), the stopage of protoplasmic
streaming can be used to study the damaging effects of various agents
in vivo.  The experiments showed a wide range of variability that is
met with an ecological races as well as within a single selection line
and its parental race under conditions when selection had not taken
this point into consideration.  Using the same critrium we attempted
to uncover the variability that is present in ecological races of
Arabidopsis in respect to cell resistance to damage caused by high
hydrostatic pressure (HHP).  It should, however, be emphasized that
HHP is not a factor that is directly affected by selection either in
nature or in the laboratory.<p>

For the investigations we used the same material that was described
earlier (ASHRAF, 1970).  Stopage of protoplasmic streaming was
performed in a hydrolic press accorging to ALEXANDROV et al.  (1959).
Since ALEXANDROV et al. (1971) assumed that the concentration of the
osmotically active substances in the cell is the mechanism by which
the cell resistance to HHP varies, we determined the concentration of
these osmotically active substances in the cell by means of
grenzplasmolysis in a KNO 3 solution during a 10 minute exposure. The
following table sums up the obtained data:<p>

Thus our data show that the level of cell resistance to HHP and the
concentration of the osmotically active substances in the cell are not
correlated in our material.  Earlier, ASHRAF (1971) and ALEXANDROV et
al. (1971) had shown that this correlationship is valid for changes in
HHP resistance of the cell that follow changes in ploidy or seasons,
respectively, It is also of interest to note that one and the same
criterium (stopage of protoplasmic streaming) can show differences in
the direction of the changes that result from the different agents
(HHP and high temperature).  These resistances, therefore, seem not to
be related to each other.<p>
