<p>A Postdoc in Plant Physiology</p>
<p>to be placed at the Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences,
    University of Gothenburg, Sweden.</p>
<p>We are seeking a motivated and interacting postdoc for a research project
    entitled Molecular basis of natural variation in stomatal CO2
    responsiveness. The overall aim of the postdoctoral project is to elucidate
    the molecular basis of the evolutionary and environmental control of natural
    variation in stomatal CO2 responsiveness in seed plants. Molecular studies
    will identify and explore the roles of yet unidentified genetic loci in
    controlling natural variation in stomatal responses to CO2 among Arabidopsis
    thaliana ecotypes adapted to contrasting climatic conditions. Furthermore,
    evolution of stomatal CO2 responsiveness and its potential acclimation to
    prevailing environmental conditions (CO2 concentration, climate) will be
    investigated in a broad range of fully sequenced species, selected to
    represent major evolutionary lineages in seed plants. The relevance of
    mechanisms identified in Arabidopsis for explaining the evolution of
    stomatal CO2 responsiveness in seed plants will be assessed by comparative
    genetic and physiological analyses. Experimental methods include leaf gas
    exchange, guard-cell isolation, real-time PCR, and quantitative trait locus
    (QTL) mapping.</p>
<p>The major tasks for the successful applicant will be to:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Collect genetic data and measure stomatal CO2 responsiveness in
        Arabidopsis</li>
    <li>and analyze those data by QTL mapping in order to identify genetic
        loci responsible for variation in stomatal CO2 responsiveness</li>
    <li>Compare loci identified in Arabidopsis with sequence information
        for other species</li>
    <li>Publish the results in international peer-reviewed journals</li>
</ol>
<p>The recruited postdoc will have main responsibility of the molecular
    parts of the project, while an already available PhD student will be in
    charge of experiments to explore evolutionary patterns and acclimatization
    potential. Three senior researchers (all Associate Professors at the host
    department) serve as advisors / supervisors on ecophysiological (Johan
    Uddling), molecular (Mats Andersson) and evolutionary (Alexandre Antonelli)
    aspects of the project.</p>
<p>
    The Department is located in the Gothenburg Botanical Garden (one of the
    largest and most excellent in northern Europe) and within walking distance
    to other Science Departments at the University of Gothenburg. The research
    at the Department covers a broad range of research areas: Plant Cell and
    Molecular Biology, Ecophysiology, Ecology and Conservation, Ecotoxicology,
    Systematics and Biodiversity. See also <a href="www.bioenv.gu.se">www.bioenv.gu.se</a>.
</p>
<p>The stipend is for two years full-time research. The total stipend is on
    480 000 Swedish krona (SEK), equivalent to 20 000 SEK per month. The
    applicant will be expected to start as soon as possible or as decided upon
    in negotiations.</p>
<p>Qualifications</p>
<p>The applicant should have a PhD in a field of plant science that is
    relevant for the project, e.g. molecular biology, physiology, physiological
    ecology. Good communication skills (written and oral) in English are
    necessary, as well as the willingness and ability to interact with
    collaborators. Specialization in plant (eco)physiology and plant molecular
    biology is an advantage, as is also experience in genetic quanitative trait
    locus (QTL) mapping, Arabidopsis research, stomatal regulation, and methods
    to measure leaf gas exchange (i.e. photosynthesis, transpiration, stomatal
    conductance).</p>
