Table1: Limits of variability for areas of different chloroplast
components in plants of Arabidopsis thaliana<p>

The range of variability of the plastid structural components was
investigated by technique of quantitative estimation of
microstructures using the linear integrater (TAGEEVA et al., 1970;
ABDULLAEV et al., 1971).  In 10 mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana
(representatives of different classes: viridis, chlorina, variegata
etc.) the rate of variability of matrix, lamellas, plastoglobules,
starch granules and vacuoles was studied (Table 1).  On the basis of
this data the optimal percent ratios of volumes of chloroplast
structure components were determined; the diagram was constructed
representing the statistical model of chloroplast structures in the
species of A. thaliana (Fig. 1)<p>

Constructing such micromorphological models for chloroplasts of
different taxons and phyletic lines is especially perspective for
clearing the chloroplast phylogeny in the plant kingdom.<p>

Morphometric analysis of ultrastructure as well as study of their
functional peculiarities also provides the construction of
morpho-functional models of chloroplasts.<p>
