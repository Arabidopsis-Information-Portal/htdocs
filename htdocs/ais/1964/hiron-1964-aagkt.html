Vol 01:<h2>HIRONO, Y., and G. P. REDEI</h2><h2>Somatic screening technique for alterations at specific loci</h2>

According to the literature, Arabidopsis has been used in relatively
extensive experiments to study the overall mutagenic effect of various
agents.<p>

In our laboratory attempts were made to investigate mutation rate at a
specific locus, ch.  The following genetic set up proved to be
useful:<P><PRE>
+           ch    + 
====================
gi    25     +  8 pa</pre><p>    

Genetic alterations at the ch locus may appear in leaf sections
extending sometimes to half leaves, or even to shoots.  With a simple
paper chromatographic test, or spectrophotometric analysis the
identity of the sector can be easily established.  Since the distance
between pa and ch is short, if seed progeny can be obtained from the
mutated sector, the old and the new allele can be easily separated.
Such a technique is of special value in comparing the specificity of
X-rays and ethylmethane sulfonate.  According to the experience
obtained in our material ethylmethane sulfonate induces many yellow
green sectors but from 16 analyzed cases none was ch, but some kind of
dominant effect of unknown loci.  All X-ray produced yellow green
sectors examined in this material turned out to be chlorophyll b
deficient i.e., locus specific.  It must be noted, however, that
majority of these sectors did not arise through a mutational event.
This can be determined only by progeny test which distinguishes
somatic recombination, deletion non-disjunction etc.  from mutation.
Seeds treated under identical conditions give rise to sectors of
similar size (half leaf or one fourth leaf) and from this the number
of functional cells in the apical meristem can be estimated. The
pattern of differentiation is also monitored by the development of the
sector.<p>
