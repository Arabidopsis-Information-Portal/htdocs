	Dry seeds of the early race Dijon were treated for 24 hours at 25*degrees*C with 0.05, 0.10 and 0.20 mM solutions of N-nitroso-N-methylurea.  The M2-plants were grown under constant conditions (25+/-3*degrees*C, continuous illumination with 1250 lux).  Since the M1-plants treated with 0.20 mM were highly sterile the corresponding M2-population could not be studied.  From each M1-plant, 16 seeds were sown; in each M2-population, there were 160 lines.<p>

	These results show that mutations can be induced by N-nitroso-N-methylurea not only in qualitative but also in quantitative characters. At the same time, the changes of means in all characters studied were quite small, while the induced genetic variance was considerable in all cases (cf. BROCK, 1964).  It seems that the amount of the induced genetic variability is not increasing linearly with the concentration (cf. DALY, 1960, 1961).<p>
