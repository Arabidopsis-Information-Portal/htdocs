On the basis of occasional good pachytene to dipolotene figures, it
was determined that trisomic II involves the main nucleolar chromosome
(figures 1 a-d).  It was reported earlier (CHEN and SEARS 1967) that
II carries REDEI's linkage group 4.  The weakest trisomic, which had
been lost, was reobtained among the offspring of 3n material.  It is
shown in figues 1 e-h.  The linkage group of this chromosome is not
yet known.*<p>
