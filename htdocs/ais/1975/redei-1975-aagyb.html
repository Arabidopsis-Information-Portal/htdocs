5-Bromodeoxyuridine and some other halogenated deoxyribonucleosides
induce early flowering in several ecotypes and late mutants of
Arabidopsis (BROWN, 1962; HIRONO and REDEI 1966).  In some related
species (BROWN, 1968) or in certain ecotypes or in mutants at a
particular gene locus, these compounds fail to evoke the same response
(HIRONO, and REDEI, 1966; REDEI 1969; REDEI, ACEDO and GAVAZZI, 1974).<p>

BROWN (1968, 1972) applied the BrdU to the apical meristem of
Arabidopsis in the prefloral stage and followed mitotic activity by
autoradiography in the developing apex.  His conclusions were that
BrdU or the related compounds are incorporated readily into the nuclei
of the prefloral flank meristem. The incorporation of the analog
caused a transient cessation of division in the cells concerned. This
suppression of mitotic activity in the flank meristem lead to an
activation of the cells in the central initiation zone, free of the
analog. Subsequently - in the absence of continued BrdU supply- the
flank meristem cells eliminated the previously obtained analog and the
entire apex now resumed mitotic activity. Thus BrdU triggered the
precocious activity of the cental zone just as it is necessary for the
transition from the prefloral to floral stage under normal conditions
of flower initiation.<p>

This attractive interpretation could not be applied to our
experiments. The plants were fed with BrdU 910E-6 M) throughout their
life cycle in aseptic test tubes. Then 6 weeks old plants, grown on
0.33 uCi 14-C-BrdU (47. mCi/mmole) were extracted and the DNA was
purified with a procedure similar to that of LEDOUX, HUART and JACOBS
(1971), followed by additional phenol and alcohol treatments.
Subsequently the DNA was subjected to density gradiant centrifugation
in CdCl.  The BrdU treatment caused a 14-20 mg increase in density
compared to thymidine controls, indicating that under the conditions
of these experiments approximately 1/5 to 1/4 of the thymine residues
were replaced by the analog. Even with the most conservative estimates
this indicates that the DNA contained about 70 million bromouracil
residues. This figure is much too large to account for substitution
only in a few structural genes.  Mutation was not observed in these
experiments. Thus it appeared most likely that BrdU affected
quantitatively certain genes which are either rich in A-T or those
where the substitution can easily lead to functional changes.<p>

Recent years the regulatory role of BrdU in the differentiation of
various animal cells and tissus has been recognized and intensively
studied (RUTTER, PICTET and MORRIS, 1973).  In Escherichia coli where
both the operator site and the lac repressor can be isolated, it has
been shown that BrdU-DNA competes with very high efficiency for and
then it binds very tightly to the repressor protein (LIN and RIGGS,
1971, 1972, 1974).  In higher organisms also the acid protein
fractions of the chromatin have been found to control the activity of
the DNA (STEIN, STEIN and KLEINSMITH, 1975)<p>

We have grown Arabidopsis plants on 14-C-arginine and 14-C valine in
the absence and presence of BrdU.  Crude chromatin was then extracted
from the plants with saline EDTA-sodium lauryl sulfate and tapped on
dacron webs in the presence of high molecular weight calf or salmon
DNA. The filter passed through all free proteins, including the
histones split from the DNA by the detergent, but it retained a highly
radioactive fraction tightly bound to DNA. &#160;The BrdU-chromatin was
found to contain in every case substantially higher radioactivity
(protein) than the appropriate control.  This observation indicated
that the analog acts apparently on the chromosomal level.<p>

Other experiments revealed that flowering in Arabidopsis is actually
suppressed in light (REDEI and ACEDO, 1974), and it proceeds with
maximal efficiency in complete darkness.  Under the latter conditions
BrdU-treatment is ineffective. Thus it seems that BrdU-DNA can
effectively bind a protein fraction controlling flowering. This is an
acid protein like the repressor of bacteria or the regulatory
chromosomal proteins of higher organisms. The simplest assumption to
explain the physiological role of BrdU in flowering is that it
facilitates the binding of a repressor to DNA which prevents the
transcription of the chromosomal regions producing the flowering
inhibotor under illumination.<p>
