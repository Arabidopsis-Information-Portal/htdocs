INTRODUCTION<p>

The mode of mating with high rates of self-fertilization and low rates
of random outcrossing on one hand and the zygotic selection against
homozygotes on the other hand seem to be the main elements of the
genetic structure of populations of predominantly self-fertilizing
plant species (Allard, Jain and Workman, 1968). The two
characteristics are also valid for Arabidopsis thaliana (Cetl, 1976).<p>

The experimental study of the mode of mating in A. thaliana developed
slowly. In the initial stages of the Arabidopsis research, this
species was held for strictly autogamous, at least under greenhouse
culture. Only in the early 70s, first special experiments elucidating
the breeding system of A. thaliana were carried out having been evoked
by various suggestions that heterozygotes played a significant role in
natural populations. The experimental designs were based on counting
wild type individuals appearing among the offspring of plants of a
recessive marker line grown in the immediate contact with plants of a
dominant wild type line. Then the percent of wild type individuals
represented an unambiguous estimate of the outcrossing rate under the
experimental conditions given.<p>

In this way Lawrence and Snape (1971) obtained, in total, 180
individuals from outcrossing among 10,398 plants or 1.73%. A portion
of the experimental material coming from more open conditions gave a
higher proportion of outcrossing than the other from more sheltered
conditions, 2.15 or 1.19%. Robbelen (1971) found, after a special
correction for wild type admixtures, 216 individuals from outcrossing
among 20,664 plants or 1.05%, a result which came very close to that
of Lawrence and Snape (1971), at least for the more sheltered
condition.<p>

A further improvement of the techniques consisted in the choice of two
different, non-allelic recessive marker lines giving complementing
wild type individuals under mutual crossing. The techniques enabled,
when the seeds from the plants of the partner lines were harvested
separately, to determine the percent of outcrossing in either
directions, i.e., in the two corresponding reciprocal crosses. Cetl
and Plchova (1975) and Cetl (1976) found, using the recessive marker
lines an and ln, in total 20 individuals from outcrossing among 930 or
very different from those given by Lawrence and Snape (1971) and
Robbelen (1971). At the same time, large differences were observed
between the two reciprocal spontaneous crosses: from the seeds on an
plants (female an x male ln) no complementing plant appeared among 556
(0% of outcrossing) while from the seeds on ln plants (female ln x
male an) 20 complementing plants appeared among 374 (5.35% of
outcrossing). In the variant with a well-defined artificial motion of
plant during flowering, the figures of the outcrossing rate were
higher. In total, 46 individuals from outcrossing were found among
1,032 or 4.46% of outcrossing.  Again, no complementing plant appeared
in female an x male ln among 567 (0% of outcrossing) while in female
ln x male an 46 complementing plants appeared among 465 (9.89% of
outcrossing). Thus, at least in some cases, the reciprocal differences
of the outcrossing rate can be considerable.<p>

The pattern of sowing the two partner genotypes was rather different
in these first experiments. Lawrence and Snape (1971) surrounded one
recessive marker plant by six wild type homozygotes. Robbelen (1971)
used a random distribution of the two genotypes. Cetl and Plchova
sowed them in alternative rows.<p>

Relichova (1978) compared the percentage of outcrossing in 6 different
reciprocal combinations of 4 recessive marker lines. The partner lines
were distributed (1) in alternative rows and (2) in a chessboard
pattern. In total, the percentage of outcrossing was twice in the
chessboard pattern with its more close contact between plants of the
two lines than in alternating rows but, compared with all previous
estimates of the outcrossing rate, the figures were very low, .08 or
.18%. The differences between particular pairs of lines were due to
their genotypic differences expressed in the phenotype (flowering
time, plant habit and others). More or less pronounced reciprocal
effects appeared in some cases.<p>

The contradiction between the average outcrossing rates of about 1 to
2% and those of about 1 to 2% could be solved with taking the partial
fertility of the ln line into account (Cetl, 1976). Under the supposed
insufficience of the pollen of the ln line to bring about normal
self-fertilization, certain possibilities can be opened for
outcrossing with the pollen of neighbouring plants of another
genotype, up to several percentage. Reciprocally, the outcrossing rate
will be zero or nearly so. Then the overall proportion of outcrossing
will amount about 1 to 2%. On the other hand, the outcrossing rates of
about 1 to 2% will testify for more or less normal autofertility of
partner lines.<p>

In the present paper, this hypothetical explanation was tested by
choosing a further recessive marker line, lc, which appeared normal in
fertility, and using it, along with the an and ln lines, in all
possible combinations. In the neighbourhood of plants of the lc line,
several percentage of outcrossing would appear in the partially
fertile ln line (female ln x male lc) and very low or zero percentage
in the fertile an line (female an x male lc). Very low or zero
percentge of outcrossing would appear in the reciprocal combinations.<p>

At the same time, we attempted to demonstrate what role may be played
by partial fertility leading to increased outcrossing rates in the
population.<p>

MATERIAL AND METHODS<p>

Recessive marker lines an (angustifolia; leaves narrow, pods normal),
lc (lucida; leaves shining yellow-green, pods normal), and ln
(lanceolata; leaves narrow, pointed, lance-shaped, pods short) were
used in mixed cultures of all three combinations: 1. an + lc, 2. an +
ln, and 3. lc + ln. Each combination was grown in soil in a separate
flat vessel from plastic material 60 x 30 x 6 cm according to the
procedure given by Cetl, Relichova and Krskova (1970). The chessboard
pattern was used so that each plant of one line was surrounded by four
plants of the other line. The distance of plants was 2 x 2 cm
(generation 0). Mature seeds of each individual plant were then
harvested separately in each combination and line. Thirty seeds of
each plant were sown in generation l. The distance of plants was 2 cm
between rows and l cm within rows. In the stage of 4 to 5 leaves, the
daughter plants were classified according to their phenotype and the
percentage of complementing wild type (hybrid) individuals from
spontaneous outcrossing was expressed for particualr families and
pooled for the whole material in each combination and line. Some
plants of the ln line did not produce seeds at all or gave a low
number of daughter plants. Thus the total number of plants classified
in the progeny of the ln line was lower compared with an and lc.<p>

Plants of the two gnerations 0 and 1 were grown at 25 +/- 3 *degreesC
under artificial illumination 1.25 klux, using incandescent bulbs in
combination with lumiscent tubes, the photoperiod was 12 hours.<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

The outcrossing rates (Table 1) were highest when the partially
fertile line ln appeared as mother; the percentage of outcrossing was
9.17 in the presence of an and 3.88 in the presence of lc. In all
other cases, the outcrossing rates were very low or zero (.24 to 0%).
In total, 28 hybrids were observed among 424 plans originating from
female ln (6.60% of outcrossing), and only 4 hybrids among 2,104
plants originating from both an and lc (.18% of outcrossing). Thus the
percentage of outcrossing was almost 40 times higher when the
partially fertile ln line appeared as mother, compared with the
fertile an and lc lines (*chi*sq.(1) = 144.56 &gt; *chi*sq.(1).05 =
3.84). The partial fertility of the line ln can be a decisive
condition for high outcrossing rates. The statistically significant
difference between the two fathers, an and lc (*chi*sq.(1) = 6.92 &gt;
3.84) shows that the outcrossing rates in female ln are also dependent on
the male partner being almost 2 times higher in the presence of male an
compared with lc.<p>

Thus the data in Table 1 confirm the positive answer to the initial
question: the line lc is able to produce almost 4 percentage of
hybrids in the partially fertile line ln and very low or zero
percentage of hybrids in the fertile an line. Really, the partial
fertility of ln may be considered decisive in the determination of the
high outcrossing rates.<p>

From the point of view of the ability to produce hybrids by means of
spontaneous outcrossing, there may be "good" (ln) and "bad" (an, lc)
mothers and also "good" (an), intermediate (lc), and "bad" (ln)
fathers, using the terminology accepted by Mendel in the
classification of his Hieracium species according to the success of
artificial crossings (Correns, 1905; Cetl, 1973).<p>

Table 1: Number and percentage of hybrids in the progeny of plants of
recessive marker lines an lc, and ln grown in mixed cultures.<p>

A simple analysis of variance of the percentage of outcrossing in the
recessive marker lines used in the present experiment led to the
following degrees of freedom (df) and mean squares (ms) for mothers,
fathers and residual (interaction of mothers and father):<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol23/vol23-pg36-tab0.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

Even if the paternal and especially maternal genotypes play a role in
determining the percentage of outcrossing, the largest mean square
following from the interaction of the two genoytpes suggests that the
best success of outcrossing is secured only in very specific pairs of
partner genotypes, like lnx an, in other words, when the maternal
genoytpe as well as the paternal one are "good" in the ability to
produce spontaneous hybrids.<p>

Two conditions seem to be fulfilled in order to obtain high
outcrossing rates in A. thaliana: (1) Partial fertility of the female
partner due to pollen insufficience. Then only a part of stigmata will
be covered with own pollen and only a part of ovules will be
fertilized. In the consequence, occasion arises to fertilization with
the pollen of neighbouring fertile individuals. (2) High ability of
the male partner to loose mature pollen which may be effective in
outcrossing. In the case of the combination female ln x male an, the
two conditions do really exist. On one hand, many pollen grains of the
ln line appear defective, and on the other, the an line belongs to
those whose abundant pollen production leads to shedding of pollen
grains from the flowers during flowering.<p>

The situtation is analogical to that in different varieties of Tagetes
patula L. (Cetl and Relichova, 1980 and unpublished). In T. patula,
the cultivars with high proportion of purely female outer flowers in
the inflorescence are "good" mothers and the cultivars with abundant
production of free pollen are "good" fathers. In both T. patula and A.
thaliana, not only the maternal and paternal genotypes themselves but
mainly the interaction between them seem to determine the resulting
rate of spontaneous outcrossing.<p>

Regarding the role of outcrossing in the populations of predominantly
self-fertilizing species, it was shown that already low proportions of
outcrossing lead to the equilibria connected with certain frequencies
of heterozygotes, H&gt;0, in contrast to full self fertilization where H =
O. The equilibrium frequency of heterozygotes, however, will be only
slightly enhanced if 1 or 2% of outcrossing were taken into account
(cf. Cetl, 1976). Thus the cases of partial fertility leading to high
proportions of outcrossing (up to near 10%) seem, on the first sight,
to give better preconditions for high equilibrium frequencies of
heterozygotes<p>

In the absence of zygotic selection against homozygotes, the
equilibrium frequency of heterozygoes, H= 2pq[2(1-a)/(2-a)], depends
not only on the proportion of self-fertilization, (a), or of random
outcrossing (c(a+c=1)), but also on the gene frequencies (p, q). Two
proportions of random outcrossing (higher than the usual c=.01 or .02)
will be considered in order to cover the range of outcrossing rates
observed in partially fertile lines, e.g., the ln line, c=.05 and
c=.1. Then the equilibrium frequencies of heterozygotes will be the
following at the gene frequencies given:<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol23/vol23-pg38-tab2.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

Only several percentages of heterozygotes may be retained in the
equilibrium population when the marker allele connected with the
fertility pleiotropically is common (q = .5). The more rare the
allele, the lower the euqilibrium frequency of heterozygotes. At low
gene frequencies, say q = .01, the equilibrium frequency of
heterozygotes is only several promille. Such an allele may be expected
to be rather rare, especially in natural populations. Then the allele
cannot contribute to equilibria connected with high frequencies of
heterozygotes.<p>

In the presence of zygotic selection against homozygotes, the
equilibrium frequency of heterozygotes is given by the equations for
the equilibrium fixation index, F, the equilibrium gene frequency, p.,
and the resulting equilibrium frequency of heterozygotes, H (Workman
and Jain, 1966; cf. Cetl, 1976, equations (4) to (6), p. 30). At
different adaptive values of the two homozygotes, w 1, w 2, and at
c=0, c=.05, and c=.1, respectively, the equilibrium genotypic
frequencies of heterozygotes, H, will be as follows:<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol23/vol23-pg38-tab3.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

It can be seen from the survey that only the w 1, w2 values &lt;.5 lead
to H&gt;0 except for the cases of symmetrical selection (w1 approximates
w2), when, at the same time, c&gt;0. It is to be expected that the
partially fertile homozygote with the adaptive value w 2 will be worse
in reproduction compared with the other homozygote with the adaptive
value w 2. Thus w1&gt;w2, the selection against homozygotes appears
asymmetrical. For instance, when c=.1 and w 2=.2 the heterozygote will
be retained in the population at w 1=.56 but not at w 1=.58. A strong
selection against the fertile homozygote is necessary to obtain
H&gt;O. The limit at approximately .57 is not very different from that of
.5 for full autogamy (c=O). It means that the highest rates of
outcrossing yet known in A. thaliana do not surpass the necessity of a
strong zygotic selection against homozygotes in order to preserve
heterozygotes in the population.<p>

The estimates for the ln locus (Svobodova and Cetl, 1977) led to w 1
=.6624 and w 2=.1986. Under such an asymmetric selection, the ultimate
loss of heterozygotes appears inevitable. The only possibility to
overcome the loss of heterozygotes is to substitute the genetic
background of the locus as suggested by Relichova and Michalek (1986).
In their experiments, the genetic background of the H55 line
(Napp-Zinn, 1979) led to a conspicuous symmetrization of the selection
against homozygotes.<p>

SUMMARY<p>

The hypothetical explanation for the contradition between the average
outcrossing rates of 1 to 2% and those of about 1 to 2% (insufficient
pollen for normal self fertilization) was tested by choosing a further
recessive marker line, lc, which appeared normal in fertility, and
using it, along with the an and ln lines, in all possible
combinations. In the neighbourhood of plants of the line lc, several
percentage of outcrossing would appear in the partially fertile line
ln (female ln x male lc) and very low or zero percentage in the
fertile line an (female an x male lc).  Very low or zero percentage of outcrossing would
appear in the reciprocal combinations.<p>
