In the last issue of A I S (Corcos 1973), I reported the isolation of
an arginine mutant.  This report was premature, since further work
soon demonstrated that it was a "leaky" mutant whose growth was
repressed by glucose.  In other words, it grows normally on
glucose-free media, but as the concentration of glucose is increased,
its growth is decreased (Table 1).  Other sugars were tested. Sucrose
enhanced in a similar manner the growth of both the normal and the
mutant strain (Table 2).  Maltose and cellobiose, on other hand,
seemingly depressed the growth of the mutant.<p>

weeks.  Dry weight of the arginine mutant (15 plants) in presence of
dextrose after 4 weeks at different sugar concentrations.<p>

weeks on media without sugar and with sugars.<p>

Only a few examples of glucose-effect are known in higher plants.  In
Arabidopsis thaliana, Li and Redei (1968) have reported that glucose
and maltose are inhibitors of a set of mutants in the thiamine
pathway. The point that it is the mutant, not the normal plant, which
is inhibited by glucose should be stressed, since it might lead to a
genetic understanding of the glucose-effect.<p>

Because of the nature of this mutant and its importance in research,
as attested by the demand for seeds and tissue, we are attempting to
get a non-leaky type as well as a haploid strain.<p>
