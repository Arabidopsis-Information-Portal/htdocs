POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN FRUIT METABOLOMICS AT UCDAVIS
A postdoctoral position is available immediately in the Department of Plant Sciences at UC Davis 
to investigate the molecular basis of fruit development and ripening in citrus. The project builds 
upon the recently characterized citrus fruit proteome and aims at analyzing the fruit metabolome 
to explore the factors affecting fruit development and ripening. The postdoctoral fellow will 
quantify metabolic pools in developing citrus juice sac cells by analytical techniques (LC, GCMS, 
LCMS) and use bioinformatics tools to derive metabolic pathways operating during fruit 
development. Biochemical strategies will be used for targeted analysis of metabolic steps 
involved in the formation of key fruit quality components. The project is a collaboration between 
the laboratories of Dr. Eduardo Blumwald and Dr. Florence Negre-Zakharov. The position is for 
two years and is renewable upon performance and funding. 
Candidates must have a PhD with a strong background in biochemistry, molecular biology. 
Experience in analytical chemistry is a plus. To apply, please email a letter of research interest, 
CV, and contact information of three references to Dr. Florence Negre-Zakharov, 
fnegre@ucdavis.edu, Department of Plant Sciences, One Shields Ave, University of California, 
Davis, CA 95616-8780, USA.
