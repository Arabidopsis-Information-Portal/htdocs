Post-doc position (2 years) at the Umeå Plant Science Centre on 
The Role of the Cytoskeleton During Planar Polarity Formation in Arabidopsis 
The position is available at the earliest possible time point. The project addresses the role of the actin and 
tubulin cytoskeletons during the coordination of cell polarity in the Arabidopsis root epidermis, specifically 
during the formation of plant-specific planar polarity of root-hair positioning (c.f. Grebe et al. 2002, 
Current Biology 12, 329-334; Fischer et al. 2006, Current Biology 16, 2143-2149; Fischer et al. 2007, 
Biochem. Soc. Trans. 35,149-151). Highly motivated candidates with expertise in Arabidopsis genetics, 
molecular biology, cell biology and biochemistry may contact project leader Dr Markus Grebe, Umeå Plant 
Science Centre, Department of Plant Physiology, Umeå University, markus.grebe@plantphys.umu.se
To qualify for the position you should have a PhD degree or equivalent, preferably not more than three 
years old.
