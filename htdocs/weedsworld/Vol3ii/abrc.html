ABRC is now mailing the new 1996 catalog supplement. As mentioned in the 
previous issue of Weeds World, we are publishing the current catalog in
the form of a Supplement to the 1995 edition.  This will save substantial 
production and mailing charges.  In addition to the hard copy version of 
the supplement, we have also compiled a <A HREF="http://aims.cps.msu.edu/aims/aims.html#catalog" target="_top">Web version of the catalog</A>. Note that the stocks of the 1995 Seed List are still 
available and can be ordered.  The electronic version of this list is also 
maintained <A HREF="http://aims.cps.msu.edu/aims/aims.html#catalog" target="_top">on our Web server</A>.  Either document may be printed from your 
Web browser by chapters.  Of course, all new and previous stocks are 
included in AIMS and can be searched, browsed and ordered from the 
<A HREF="http://aims.cps.msu.edu/aims/aims.html" target="_top">database</A>.  In addition, color images are available in AIMS for many of 
the seed stocks, including representative photographs for a majority of
the different phenotypes.<p>
We are mailing catalog supplements to individuals who received the 1995 
catalog.  However, if you prefer to use the Web version, just send an email 
to our main  <A HREF="http://aims.cps.msu.edu/aims/message.html" target="_top">address</A> and we will not mail a paper version to you.   We 
are certainly pleased to provide the paper version to all who want one.<p>
The stocks now available and described in the  catalog and AIMS include
the following:
<menu>
<ul><li>More than 100 new mutant lines;
<li>Several ecotypes collected from new locations and having interesting characteristics; 
<li>T-DNA lines from the Koncz laboratory;
<lI>Enhancer and gene trap transposon lines from the Martienssen laboratory;
<li>Lines with mapped Ds elements for transposon tagging from the Baker laboratory;
<li>More than 80 new DNA stocks containing cloned genes;
<li>New ARMS clones from the Schaeffner laboratory;
<li>RFLP cosmids from the Goodman laboratory;
<li>A library for two hybrid screening from the Theologis laboratory;
<li>A P1 library from Mitsui and RITE;
<li>A BAC library from Texas A&amp;M;
<li>YAC libraries from the Ecker laboratory (yUP) and CNRS France (CIC).  
</ul>
</menu>
Some of the above stocks have been in distribution for differing time periods since the previous catalog, but the majority are new.  We hope that you will find these stocks useful.<p>
The single lines from most of the original Feldmann T-DNA population are 
now available for followup analysis.  It will not be possible to order the 
entire set of these lines, since we do not have the resources to assemble 
such large quantities of stocks.  However, groups of them corresponding
to 
small sets such as one or a few pools of 20 lines can be ordered. 
Currently, you may inquire about these using the Feldmann number.  We 
expect to have the stock information for these lines entered into AIMS by 
Sept. 1, so that the lines can be ordered by stock number after 
that date.   We are currently growing a set of 2000+ lines donated by the 
Thomas Jack laboratory and hope to be able to distribute these by late 
autumn.  We would be pleased to receive other T-DNA line donations, 
preferably in groups of at least 1000 lines.  It is also an excellent time 
to donate other seed and DNA stocks.  The donation forms are available from 
the <A HREF="ftp://ftp.cps.msu.edu/pub/aims/ABRC/" target="_top">AIMS FTP server</A>.<p>
 
The isolated DNA from the Feldmann T-DNA lines has been received by the 
Center and will be available as soon as aliquoting is completed.  This DNA 
was isolated in a two-dimensional pooling scheme so that screening of the 
pools should identify a group of 10 lines of which the correct line is a 
member.  Seeds of the 10 individual lines can then be obtained to isolate 
the actual mutant.  An announcement will be posted to the newsgroup when 
this stock is ready for distribution.<p>
