Differences in the phytochrome mediated photomorphosis of certain
mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) HEYNH. have been observed (HEHL
and KRANZ 1971, DIEKMANN and KRANZ 1972, KRANZ 1974).  We had supposed
that these differences resulted from defects in the red/far
red-mechanism and its primary effect on the differentiation of the
seedling (KRANZ 1974 b).  But at this time there was no direct
evidence for the defect of the phototransformation of the phytochrome
itself.<p>

For measuring the in-vivo transitions of this pigment induced by
R/FR-radiation, at present we can only use the method of the
spectrophotometric determination of the extinction differences in the
seedlings.  Our measuring equipment consists of an one-beam
spectrophotometer (ZEISS PMQ II) with monochromatic grid illuminator,
automatic drive for the wavelength, specific sample holder connected
by an optical lens system, sensitive photomultiplier, a/d-computer,
printer and recorder.  Both, the actinic light (R: lambda = 660 +/- 5.7
nm 280 pE/cm**-2/sec, FR: lambda = 730 +/- 0.6 nm 6 pE/cm**-2/sec) and
the measuring beam (lambda = 660 +/- 0.6nm 9 pE/cm**-2/sec, lambda =
730 +/- 0.6 nm 6 pE/cm**-2/sec)  were produced by the monochromatic
illuminator. The samples measured were seedlings of the mutants
ch1/ch1, ch2/ch2, ch3/ch3 and the wildtype ch+ch+/ch+ch+ grown up in
absolute darkness (14 +/- days old, hypocotyl length +/- 2mm).
Germination has been induced by GA3 plus c-AMP (10-3M aqueaus
solution).  In order to get stationary concentrations of the
phytochrome (apparent photosteady state) the base values (E) of the
extinction at *gamma* = 660 and 730 nm have been measured five times
alternatively; between the measurements the sample has been kept in
the dark. Then the extinction has been recorded again in five
repetitions each treating with 5 min. R-and FR-radiation in order to
get the difference *delta* E after the actinic light treatment.<p>

Preliminary tests had been shown, that the standard deviation of *delta* E
for one sample treated was low (s = 0.92 x 10E-3) but high between
different samples (s = 7.54 x 10E-3) for one genotype (ch3).
Apparently the higher deviation depends on the sample amount (number
and height of the seedlings). But it is impossible to control these
factors in Arabidopsis because of its small seedlings and the
requirment to keep them absolutely dark up to measurement.  However E
may be used as parameters for the sample amount. Thus we have
calculated a significant correlation between E and *delta* E. Figure 1
shows that this correlation (r) is negative after treatment with
R(*delta*Er) and positive with FR(*delta*Efr) for all the genotypes studied,
i.e., the decrease and increase respectively of the regression line
depend on E which is nearly equal to the sample amount. This is only
true for the measuring range of E and *delta*E.<p>

Table 1: Coefficients of the correlation (r) and the regression (b)
with the Y-intercept (a) for different actinic light treatments (R,
FR) in the wildtype (ch+/ch+) and three mutants of Arabidopsis
thaliana seedlings (Fs-test for differences between to b's, *alpha* =
probability, d.f. = degrees of freedom)<p>

Further the statistical Fs-test (SOKAL and ROHLF 1973) yields
significant differences of the regression coeffecients b between the
genotypes (table 1).  After treatment with the actinic light R the b
of the mutants are significantly smaller than the b of the wildtype
(ch+) and the b of ch3 too in relation to the other mutants. &#160;This
signifies a smaller increase of the extinction after R in those
genotypes, which we can interpret as the synthesis of the phytochrome
Pr from a precursor Pv and/or the transition of Pr to Pfr because the
absorption of both intermediates is measured at *gamma* = 660 nm.
Nevertheless it is common to the two reactions that the second step
only is a photochemical one (MOHR 1972).  Therefore we may conclude
that the transition Pr to Pfr *in the presence of light* is reduced in
the mutants. After 5 min. FR other differences of b are obtained.  All
the genotypes are significantly different in their regressions; i.e.,
the decrease of the extinction after FR is smaller in genotypes having
low coefficients. This signifies the decay of Pfr by reversion to Pr
in a thermal reaction or by destruction in an irreversible enzymatic
reaction, the second of which seems always to be the dominant process
in a seedling.<p>

Figure 1: Different regressions between the ground value of the
extinction (E) and the extinction differences (*delta*E) after treatments
with 5 minutes red (R) or far red (FR) actinic light in three mutants
(ch1, ch2, ch3) and the wildtype ch+) of Arabidopsis thaliana
seedlings.<p>

As mentioned above the prerequisite for quantitative studies, the
photosteady state of the phytochrome, have been fulfilled
approximately. Therefore we suppose that the absolute rate of the Pr
formation equals the rate of the Pfr decay, that means the quotient of
the regression coefficients Q = br/bfr is near 1.0. This is true for
the mutants ch1 and ch2, but for the wildtype and the third mutant
this value is significantly higher (Q = 2.3 and 1.7 rsp.).
Consequently we may conclude, that the transitions of the phytochrome
from Pr to Pfr in ch+ and the Pfr-decay in ch3 are probably defective
dependent on their genotype.  This supposition is supported by the
known photomorphogenetic defects of ch+ and ch3 in contrast to ch1 and
ch2 and by the fact that these genotypes are mutants of one gene but
ch3 of another gene locus (KRANZ 1971).<p>
