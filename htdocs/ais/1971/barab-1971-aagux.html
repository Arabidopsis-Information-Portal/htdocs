Crossing of Arabidopsis may cause some difficulties to the
inexperienced experimenter because of the small size of the flowers
and the relative paucity of pollen grains in the anthers.  Various
methods of cross-pollination have been described (MULLER, 1961;
FEENSTRA, 1965).  In our laboratory we have used successfully for
years sharp tweezers under a 2 inch focal distance 5X watchmaker's
magnifier held on the head or under a dissecting microscope equipped
with zoom-lens. With this technique that most time-consuming part of
crossing is the careful emasculation. If the plants are very vigorous
one person may produce daily several thousands of hybrid seed by such
a procedure.  Accidental selfing can be easily detected if the female
parent is homozygous for a recessive seedling marker or the pollen
donor is labelled with a dominant mutation.<p>

Recently we observed that mutant as (asymmetric rosette leaves)
(linkage group 2; REDEI, 1965) allelic to REINHOLZ's (1947) mutation
magnifica, generally develops in their flowers a protruded style
carrying a stigma receptive several days before the anthers dehisce.<p>

Two series of experiments by pollinating non-emasculated as1
homozygotes with two pollen donor stocks yielded the following
results:<p>

The population of single fruits in group I varied from almost all
maternal to 100% hybrid progenies, depending on the age and
physiological stage of the stigma.  In group II the percentage of
hybrid seedlings was much larger among the offspring obtained by
pollination carried out at two different dates. This higher success
was due partly to the early pollination and partly to the fact that
mutant er is a very good pollen donor.<p>

Mutants similar to as have been repeatedly described in the tomato
(RICK and ROBINSON, 1951).  While the ex (exerted) mutants of the
tomato set only 7-15% seed by selfing depending on the degree of
extrusion of the stigma the as1 mutant of Arabidopsis is as fertile as
the wild type even when artificial pollination is not used. The shape
of the rosette leaves of as is characteristic; thus the selfed
individuals can be easily identified at a very early developmental
stage. The use of as females increases the efficiency of crossing
several fold and it is comparable to that of cytoplasmic male
sterility in other plant species, a condition not yet available in
Arabidopsis. Actually the employment of as stocks shows some
advantages above a cytoplasmic material in as much as no restorer is
needed to produce normal fertility and yield upon selfing, if so
desired for maintenance.<p>
