Though the mating type of Arabidopsis thaliana is that of an obligate
self fertilizer, rare rates of outbreeding (1% esp. 5%) in natural
populations as well as between mutant lines were estimated (Lawrence
and Snape, 1971; Robbelen, 1971; Cetl, 1976; Relivhova, 1978; Trnena
et al., this volume). Evidently, the amount of alien fertilization
depended on the flowering behaviour and its genetic control. However,
the reason why hybridization occurs has not yet been discussed in
detail; the near distance of flowering plants and thus casual
pollination through contact was only supposed.<p>

To the twenty year's experience of the second author, when spatial
separation of the flowering genotypes with vertical glass slices is
secured, the rate of outcrossing in cultivating and propagating
hundreds of wild type and mutant lines is indeed very low. Under those
conditions the outcrossing cannot be distinguished from accidental
seed mixing during harvest. On the other hand, the structure of the
papillary stigma and the sticky pollen (see photos in Arabid. Inf.
Serv. 16, back and front cover) seems to be predestinated for
polination by insects. Further, on the receptacle of the flower two
honey glands are found which might secrete a solution attractive to
flies. At present, however, there is no evidence for an
incompatibility system controlling the fertilization process
genetically in Arabidopsis. With respect to the putative insect
pollinator significant preconditions are fulfilled by certain species
of hoverflies (Syrphidae); they are small enough and able to hover in
front of the tiny and tender flowers.<p>

MATERIAL AND METHOD<p>

Based on these findings, we have started recently a cooperative study
on the putative entomogamous hybridization in Arabidopsis with the aid
of several species of Hoverflies (Syrphidae) and two selected marker
lines of plants as listed below:<p>

Syritta pipiens L. (Subdam. Milesiidae) body length 7-9 mm, Neoascia
podagrica Fab. (Subfam. Milesiidae) body length 5-6 mm Syrphus
corollae Fab. (Subfam. Syrphinae) body length 9-12 mm, Epistrophe
balteata Deg. (Subfam. Syrphinae) body length 7-10.5 mm.<p>

Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. marker lines hy-2, gl-l, Ms (long
hypocotyl, glabrous leaves, male fertile) and +, +, ms resp Ms (short
hypocotyl, hairy leaves, male sterile); the lasts segregating from the
cross msms x Msms in 1:1 proportion.<p>

In the first experiments two pots, each one filled with several plants
of one marker line, were placed side by side in a flight cage of about
0.5 m 3 volume with sides covered with screen and plexiglas. Several
flies of Epistrophe balteata were added.<p>

RESULTS<p>

If successful reciprocal outcrossing of the two Arabidopsis lines
ocurred we may except the frequencies of phenotypes in the F 1
generation as shown in Table 1.<p>

Among the offspring of line hy-2, gl-1, Ms the plants showing short
hypocotyl and hairy leaves and among the plants +,+, ms those
characterized by male fertility are the heterozygous F 1 phenotypes to
be expected from alien fertilization.<p>

Since seeds only of hy-2, gl-l, Ms plants and +, +, ms plants were
harvested separately, after seeding the numbers and frequencies of
phenotypes obtained were as shown in Table 2. The more than three
times higher outcrossing in the offspring of +, +, ms plants (85/441)
can be explained by the reduced frequency of pollination between
sister plants of the msms/Msms marker line and thus increased chance
of alien fertilization with pollen of the hy-2, gl-l, Ms transmitted
by the flies. Alternatively, on account of the lower value of 8% the
frequency of successful outcrossing of hy-2, gl-l, Ms (85/440) must
have been reduced, because only 50% of the plant of its male partner
can produce fertile pollen. Given by chance the arithmetical value
would be 26.2/2 = 13.1% which is somewhat higher than the observed
frequency of 8.0%. This additional increase of 13.1 minus 8.0 = 5.1%
is caused probably by the really prolonged open flowering of the male
sterile flowers which will be visited more often by the flies. Another
interpretation would be the decreased development of line hy-2, gl-l,
Ms as mentioned above and shown by the low seed germination of 50%
(Table 2). In this case, however, the reverse result must be observed,
i.e., a higher rate of entomogamy in the hy-2, gl-l, Ms plants which
was not realized.<p>

The data so far obtained and interpreted yield a first evidence for
successful alien pollination and fertilization by flies of Epistrophe
balteata Deg. under experimental conditions. Therefore, in an
additional experiment, one pot with 16 plants, was exposed in the open
land of a garden near to the ground level. Although, masses of flies
of Epistrophe balteata Deg. and Syrphus colollae Fab. were present for
a longer period of days no flies of this larger species were observed
visiting the Arabidopsis flowers. Alternatively, flies of the smaller
species Syritta pipiens L. and Neoascia podagrica Fab. hovering in
front of the flowers were often observed. This finding suggests
further investigations with these in nature more rare species of flies
under comparable well designed experimental and better controlled
natural conditions on the visiting behaviour and feeding process of
Syrphidae flies with Arabidopsis flowers.<p>
