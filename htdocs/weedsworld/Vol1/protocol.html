   The whole mount <I>in situ</I> method is derived from the Tautz 
and Pfeifle (1989) paper (Chromosoma 98:81-85) which 
described the non-radioactive localisation of hunchback mRNA 
in Drosophila embryos. Ludevid <I>et al</I> (1992) have adapted the 
method in a Plant Physiol. paper (<B>100</B>, 1633-1639) to suit 
young Arabidopsis seedlings. Other groups, such as Kwart <I>et al</I> 
(1993) (Plant J., <B>4</B>, 993-1002), have reported its use in 
localising differential gene expression. I would still recommend 
performing in situs using sections as well, but this provides a 
useful means to have a quick 'look and see' at your mRNAs 
spatial expression pattern. <P>

The Ludevid <I>et al</I> (1992) paper provides only brief details of 
their modification to the Tautz and Pfeifle paper, so I've written 
out details of my protocol. All washing steps are conducted at 
room temperature (unless stated in the text) and samples are 
attached to a rotating wheel to facilitate washing. All solutions 
are DEPC-treated (except Tris containing ones) in case 
riboprobes are used. <P>

<ul>
<li>1. Germinate Arabidopsis seed on 1% agar plates containing 
MS (l X strength) + 1% sucrose, pH 5.8. Place the plates 
vertically so not to damage the roots on later transfer to 
eppendorfs. <P>
<li>2. Take Arabidopsis seedlings in the range 3-8 days post 
germination, carefully removing them from the plate into a 
small eppendorf containing 500 microlitres PBS + 67mM EGTA + 
6% Formaldehyde (PBS + E + F) and fixing for 25 minutes at RTP. <P>
<li>3. Remove the fixative and store the seedlings in 5OO 
microlitres 100% ethanol for 24 days at RTP (I've left them 
longer than this and they appeared to have worked: this step 
will remove all of the pigmentation in the aerial parts) <P>
<li>4. Remove the ethanol and wash 3 X 5 minutes with 5OO 
microlitres PBS + 0.1% Tween 20 (termed PBT) attaching the 
tubes to a rotating wheel to aid washing. <P>
<li>5. Proteinase K treat the samples (using the proteinase at a 5O 
micrograms/ml working concentration) in PBS for 3-5 minutes. 
Remove the protease solution and replace with 5OO microlitres 
2 mg/ml glycine in PBT, mix and leave for 2 minutes to stop 
residual protease activity. <P>
<li>6. Wash the samples in PBT 2 X 5 minutes, then refix in PBS + 
E + F for a further 20 minutes, followed by 3 X 10 minute 
washes in PBT. <P>
<li>7. Start the prehybridisation by washing the seedlings in a 
1:1 mix of PBT and hybridisation solution (termed HS which 
consists of 5 X SSC, 50% Formamide, 5O micrograms/ml heparin, 
0.1% Tween 20 and 1OO micrograms boiled salmon sperm DNA) 
for 20 minutes. <P>
<li>8. Continue the prehybridisation in HS at 55C (we use a PCR 
block) for 20-60 minutes, then remove the majority (i.e. 400 
microlitres of the 5OO microlitres total) of the HS. <P>
<li>9. Add the DIG labelled probe to the hybridising samples and 
leave overnight at 55C. <P>
<B>N.B.</B> We have found that DIG-labelled DNA probes work best, 
with respect to background and consistent staining patterns, 
but other workers (cited above) have used DIG riboprobes 
successfully. We added 2 microlitres of a heat denatured PCR 
reaction (approximately equivalent to 5Ong of probe) into the 
overnight hybridisation. <P>
<li>10. Samples are carefully washed following hybridisation, 
initially in 500 microlitres of HS, then gradually equilibrated 
back to PBT using a series of HS:PBT wash buffers (4:1, 3:2, 2:3, 
1:4), then finally PBT. All washes are for a 20 minute period. <P>
<li>11. Once the seedlings are in PBT they are incubated with a 
1:2000 dilution of the DIG antibody (Boerhinger) at 4C 
overnight. <P>
<B>N.B.</B>   To ensure that the DIG antibody does not give background 
staining, a 1:10 dilution of the antibody is preabsorbed for a 
few hours with the equivalent Arabidopsis tissue* in a PBT + 2% 
BSA solution. * This tissue is fixed in PBS + 67 mM EGTA + 3% 
Formaldehyde, then washed briefly in PBT prior to 
preabsorption with the DIG antibody. <P>
<li>12. The seedlings are washed 4 X 20 minutes in PBT (to 
remove non-specific antibody binding), then 3 X 5 minutes in 
lOOmM NaCl, 5OmM MgCl2, lOOmM Tris pH 9.5, 0.1% Tween 20 
and lmM Levamisole (an inhibitor of lysosomal phosphatases). <P>
<li>13. The seedlings are transferred to a well (in a 12 well 
microtitre dish) containing lml of the latter solution 
supplemented with 4.5 microlitres NBT and 3.5 microlitres X-
phosphate solutions (in Boerhinger DIG kit) and left to incubate 
at room temperature. If the samples need longer than a few 
hours to develop (AUXl needed overnight), leave them at 4-8 C 
overnight. <P>
<li>14. Visualise the tissue under a binocular microscope and 
photograph. Light field doesn't do the staining justice, so I 
prefer to use dark-field, which also brings out the root 
structure. <P>
