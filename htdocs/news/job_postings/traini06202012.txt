Development of a gene network for modelling of pollen thermotolerance 

Project description 
All high-throughput approaches require the management and organization 
of the data produced and the integration of the manifold existing 
resources for the identication of variations with respect to 
environment or genetics. The project will include the development of 
an integrated database with metabolomic, transcriptomic and proteomic 
data associated to information related to the many gene and gene 
families involved. The objectives are 

1) development of an efficient data management system, 
2) integration of proteomics, metabolomics, and transcriptomics data 
derived from different experimental efforts, 
3) modelling of the regulatory network implied in the HSR, and 
4) comparative analysis among heat sensitive and tolerant genotypes to 
provide support for the functional analysis of major gene families 
included in the response. 
The project requires data management, data mining and advanced 
bioinformatics.
