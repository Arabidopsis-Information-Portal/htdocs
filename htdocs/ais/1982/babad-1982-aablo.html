Phytohormons are known to control photosynthesis by two ways: first
effecting the activity of cell nucleus and chloroplast (Kulaeva,
1978); second exerting direct influence on the photosynthesis
(Anonymous, 1980)<p>

The most efficient way of the regulation of photosynthesis is the
influence of phytohormones on the primary processes of energy
conservation and on the activity of Calvin cycle enzymes. Therefore
investigation of the direct influence of different phytohormones on
the rate of light and dark phase of photosynthesis seems to be
necessary Kinetin (6-fur-furylaminopurine) - one of the synthetic
analogues of natural cytokinin (zeatin) - has been chosen for our
experiments.<p>

By investigating different subjects many researchers (Feierabend,
1969, 1970; Feierabend et al., 1978; Romanova et al., 1976) have shown
that when kinetin was used to treat the leaves or added to the plant
growth medium, the synthesis and activity of many ferments
particularly of the two unique photosynthetic ferments - ribulose
diphosphate-carboxylase (K.E.4.1.1.39) and phosphosribulokinase (PRK,
K.E.2.7.1.19) increase in chloroplasts. Previously, we (Babadzanova et
al., 1978) found that the addition of kinetin to the reaction mixture
leads to the increase of PRK activity in extracts of Arabidopsis
thaliana leaves of race Enkheim (supernatant obtained by homogenate
centrifuging during one hour at 18.000 r.p.m.). To determine the PRK
activity in these experiments ribose-5-phosphate (R-5-P) was used as
substrate because the commercial preparations of ribulose-5-phosphate
(Ru-5-P) were not available. This can be justified by the fact that in
non-purified leaf extracts there is an active ribose phosphate
isomerase catalyzing the reaction of R-5-P transformation into Ru-5-P.
In this connection a comparative study of PRK activity in extracts of
18-days-old leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana, race Enkheim in the
presence of R-5-P and Ru-5-P was carried in this work. Just as we had
expected the data given in Table 1 show that when its own true
substrate Ru-5-P was used the PRK activity was 1.5- to 2-times higher
than the PRK activity determined in the presence of R-5-P.<p>

Table 1: The influence of kinetin on the PRK activity in extracts from
Arabidopsis thaliana leaves of race Enkheim.<p>

The effect of kinetin on the PRK activity in the presence of Ru-5-P is
most activating when kinetin is added twice, both at homogenization of
leaves and to the reaction mixture.<p>

The experiments on the investigation of the influence of kinetin on
the PRK activity depending on the age of the plants have been carried
out by using the PRK true substrate PRK Ru-5-P. 16- and 8-days-old
plants of Arabidopsis thaliana, race Enkheim, and its pigment mutants
(photosensitive mutant 58/15 and dark green mutant triplex) differing
in colour have been chosen as the subjects of investigation.<p>

Table 2: The influence of kinetin on the PRK activity in leaves of
different age of Arabidopsis thaliana, race Enkheim, and its mutants.<p>

The data obtained (Table 2) show that the addition of kinetin into the
reaction medium (mixture) causes a significant increase of PRK
activation in the extracts of 16-days-old plants while in the extracts
of 28-days-old plants the activation effect of kinetin is not
significant.<p>

Earlier, the stimulating effect of cytokinin (6-benzyl-aminopurine) on
the activity of nuclear RNA-polymerase out of barley leaves depending
on the plant age was shown by in vitro experiments of Selivankina et
al., 1980.<p>

The direct, in vitro influence of kinetin on the PRK activity in the
presence of its true substrate (Ru-5-P) has been found for the first
time (Table 1 and 2). The obtained data about the stimulating effect
on the PRK activity depending on the plant age suggest that in the
leaves factors are necessary for the manifestation of the effect of
kinetin on the PRK activity. This cytokinin-binding protein acting as
hormone acceptor has been extracted out of barley leaves for
RNA-polymerase (Romanko et al., 1980).<p>
