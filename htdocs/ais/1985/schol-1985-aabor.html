By screening for chlorate-resistance, mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana
have been selected which were disturbed in the uptake of chlorate and
nitrate (Oostindier-Braaksma and Feenstra, 1973). Monitoring the
translocation of nitrate from the medium into the plants revealed that
the nitrate-uptake in Arabidopsis follows dual phase kinetics (Doddema
and Telkamp, 1979). Phase I and II represent uptake from
concentrations below and above 1 mM, respectively. Uptake in phase I
was shown to be energy-dependent, whereas a substantial part of the
nitrate uptake in Phase II was energy independent. Nitrate uptake
mtuant B1 was found to be disturbed in Phase II. It seemed of interest
to establish whether the uptake of other ions than chlorate and
nitrate in intact plants of mutant B1 was altered too. In addition,
the expression of the mutant character in protoplasts of B1 was
studied by measuring the accumulation of chlorate in protoplasts which
were prepared according to Leurs et al. (1982).<p>

Protoplasts were incubated with 4.6 mM 36 C10 3. When from estimations
of the internal volumes of the added protoplasts of wild type and B1
the accumulated chlorate after 90 min. was calculated (3.4 and 3.7 mM,
respectively), it appeared that the internal concentration did not
exceed the external concentration. Moreover, no significant
differences were found between the accumulation of labelled ions in
wild type and B1, whereas it has already been demonstrated that the
mutant character of B1 can come to expression at the cellular level
(Scholten and Feenstra, 1985). In experiment on the uptake of
potassium (rubidium) no effect on the rate of accumulation was found
when the uncoupler FCCP, which inhibits energy-dependent uptake, was
added to a final concentration of 5 micro M to protoplasts of wild
type. With identical conditions for protoplast isolation and
measurement of ion uptake in protoplasts of pea Leurs et al. (1982)
did find energy-dependent uptake of potassium. After termination of
the uptake experiments the protoplasts of Arabidopsis seemed
microscopically intact. Tests on viability indicated over 60% vital
protoplasts of both wild type and B1 after shaking for 6 hr in a water
bath. Therefore, it is not clear what has caused the absence of
differences in utptake rate between wild type and B1. It had to be
concluded that our protoplasts were unsuited for studies on uptake
mutants.<p>

In experiments with plants the accumulation of chlorate, chloride,
potassium and sulphate was measured in 8-days-old seedlings of wild
type and B1, which were grown in submerged cultures (Braaksma and
Feenstra, 1982). For uptake of chlorate, chloride and sulphate
procedures of Deane-Drummond and Glass (1982) were used. The uptake of
potassium was measured essentially as described by Polley and Hopkins
(1979). At low and high concentrations of chlorate, chloride and
potassium significantly less radioactivity was accumulated in
seedlings of B1 than in seedlings of wild type (Figure 1). The influx
of sulphate did not decrease in B1. It was concluded that the mutant
character of B1 can come to expression in seedlings grown in submerged
cultures and that this mutation affects the uptake of other ions
besides nitrate and chlorate, both anions and at least one kation, but
that the effect is probably restricted to the uptake of monovalent
ions.<p>

Figure 1: Accumulation of chlorate, sulphate, chloride and potassium,
expressed as nmol (mg fresh weight) -1, in 8-days-old seedlings of
wild type (o) and B1 (triangles) from high (solid lines) and low
(dashed lines) concentrations. The external concentrations of chlorate
were 5.0 and 0.1 mM; the concentrations of sulphate, chloride ad
potassium were 2.0 and 0.2 mM.<p>

In contrast with mature plants no clear differences between the
energy-dependence of uptake from concentrations in the range of system
I and II in seedlings were found which were grown in submerged
cultures. Apparently, the uptake characteristics of these
seedlings differ from those of mature plants. Nevertheless, the
results presented here show that such seedlings provide a convenient
tool for preliminary charactrization of presumed uptake mutants.<p>
