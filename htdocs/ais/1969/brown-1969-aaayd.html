During 1968 an investigation of the action spectrum for floral
induction of Arabidopsis thaliana, race "Estland", was carried out in
collaboration with Dr. W.H. KLEIN at the Radiation Biology Laboratory,
Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.  Initial observations were
reported (BROWN and KLEIN, 1968), and details of the methods used and
results will be published elsewhere.<p>

Absolute light requirement for seedling morphogenesis was fulfilled
with continuous far-red irradiation.  Further photomorphogenesis to
development of the primary bud cluster and elongation of the bud stem
can be accomplished, without development of photosynthetic capability,
when plants are cultured on mineral agar supplemented with 1% glucose
under continuous far-red light.  The quantum flux density required for
seedling photomorphogenesis was lower than that required for meristem
activation and floral induction.  The peak far-red wavelength for
floral induction was near 730 nm, the region from 710 to 740 was
effective, but 750 nm light was completely ineffective.  At 700 nm
germination and vegetative growth were activated, but not floral
induction.  The entire waveband from 700 to 520 nm, at energies from
100 to 200 microwatts/ cm2/sec, was ineffective in floral induction,
though maximum vegetative growth occurred in the red region. The blue
region from 400 to 500 nm was effective in floral induction.  Under
conditions where irradiation with monochromatic light is continuous
from the time the dry seed is sown, it was found that the total
quantum dose delivered to saturation of floral induction with either
blue light (485 nm), or with far-red light (730 nm), was similar for
either wavelength.  The dose required at 485 nm was 1.25 x 10 E-3
Einstein/cm2, and 730 nm it was 1.30 x 10 E-3 Einstein/cm2.  The
action spectrum in the far-red region can be interpreted in terms of
the hypothesis of HARTMANN (1966) as involving phytochrome by
continuous excitation of a circa 1% steady-state far-red absorbing
fraction of the total phytochrome pool.  However in the blue region
evidence indicates that a second photoreceptor absorbs the light and
interacts with phytochrome in mediating photomorphogenesis, since the
presence or absence or a far-red component in a four hour white light
period preceeding 20 hours of monochromatic blue light markedly
influenced the quantum effectiveness of blue light.  A similar
interaction has been suggested to explain blue and far-red effects on
photoregulation of oat mesocotyl (SANDEMEIER, 1968) though in this
tissue both red and far-red had equal effects on growth.  In the case
of flora induction in Arabidopsis under steady state irradiation, the
ineffectiveness of the red region may be ascribed to loss of
photoregulation subsequent to vegetative meristem activation, because
of destruction of Pfr and depletion of the phytochrome pool, rather
than to maintenance of an inhibitory ratio of the far-red versus red
absorbing form of phytochrome.<p>
