<h2>MORE 2,4-D RESISTANT MUTANTS</h2><p>

In previous communications we have described a mutant P83, which is
resistant to 2, 4-D and has roots displaying an altered geotropic
response (Maher, 1977; Maher and Martindale, 1978, 1980). In this
paper we describe two other mutant lines, one of which has lower
levels of resistance than P83 but displays normal geotropism, and one
in which very high levels of resistance are associated with dwarf
plant form and ageotropic roots.<p>

Table 1 gives the levels of resistance shown by these two mutants and
by P83 in separate dose-response experiments with wild type included
in each case. These experiments were carried out as described in Maher
and Martindale (1980).<p>

of seedling root growth in dose-response curves.<p>

The low resistance mutant is indistinguishable from wild type on
criteria other than resistance. Unlike P83 it has apparently normal
geotropic response and although the results of some experiments have
shown a slightly increased rate of root growth over wild type, the
difference is not consistent. The relative ages of the seed stocks
used may be an important factor here. However, regardless of growth
rate dose-response cures have given highly consistent differences
between P391 and wild type.<p>

When studying low levels of resistance it is important to avoid the
confounding effects on root length of other factors. One such factor
which may have found to be very variable in seed stocks is seed size.
To assess this variability and its effects on root length we have
fractionated seed using sieves of different mesh size and measured the
length of roots produced by the different seed classes when germinated
on plain agar.<p>

Table 2: Mean root lengths (m,m +/- S.D.) of different seed size
classes of wild type and P391. 72 seeds of each class were sown on
agar and after 4 days at 4 *degrees*C were incubated for 72 hours at
25 +/- 1*degree*C under continuous light. Agar surfaces were held at
an angle of 60*degrees*.<p>

Table 2 shows the close correlation between seed size and root growth
in both wild type and P391. In all experiments involving P391 with
other genotypes either the 280-300 micro m or 250-280 micro m seed
classes were used.<p>

The following histograms illustrate some features of the genetics of
P391. Figure 1 shows the root length of wild type, P391, and F1 and F2
generations on agar plus 0.27 microM 2, 4-D. The results suggest that
the P391 phenotype is determined by a single fully recessive allele.
Figure 2 shows the result of the complementation test between P391 and
P83 and the resulting F1 and F2 generations, on agar plus 0.73 microM
2, 4-D. The higher 2, 4-D concentration allows greater differentiation
between the two mutants. The F1 shows an intermediate level of
resistance although both mutations are separately almost fully
recessive which suggests that P391 and P83 are allelic. In the F2 the
distribution of root lengths conforms with the expected 1 : 2 : 1
ratio of P391: F1 : P83 phenotypes. If P391 and P83 are allelic it
will be intriguing to determine if the levels of georesponse in F2
seedlings are correlated with levels of 2, 4-D resistance.<p>

In the high resistance line P445, two types of seedling are
segregating. On perlite without 2, 4-D young seedlings develop either
the normal sized rosette or a very small, dark green rosette with
roots which are ageotrop and often coiled up on the surface of the
perlite. Many of these latter seedlings die but survivors produce very
short inflorescences which carry fertile flowers and set suficient
seed for genetic studies. It is the dwarf phenotypes which show
resistance to 2, 4-D although only a small proportion of them survive
with or without 2, 4-D. There is no evidence or any correction of the
dwarf genotype by the auxin. There is a 3 : 1 ratio of small : large
rosettes on perlite (see Tabel 3) and the same ratio is found for
resistance: susceptible seedlings on agar plus 2, 4-D. It seems likely
that resistance and dwarf phenotypes are pleiotropic effects of a
single dominant mutation. To date we have been unable to isolate a
pure breeding "high resistance" line from P445, which suggests that
homozygotes do not survive to produce inflourescences.<p>

growth cabinet. If 1.7 mm is taken as the division between wild type
and P391 phenotypes in the F2, a ratio of 54 : 24 is obtained (*chi*sq. 3:1
= 1.38).<p>

Table 3: Segregation in line P445 (M4) for (a) rosette size on perlite
(b) root length on agar plus 2, 4-D. The numbers of seedlings in each
class are shown.<p>

Because of the segregation in P445 the resistance level in Table 1 has
been estimated for the "resistant" seedlings in dose response curves.
These are easily distinguished from "susceptibles" because the latter
are completely inhibited at concentrations which do not affect the
resistant types.<p>

We are at present trying to improve the survival of P445 resistant
seedlings and to determine the relationships between the genetics and
physiology of the three classes of resistant mutants so far available
to us.<p>
