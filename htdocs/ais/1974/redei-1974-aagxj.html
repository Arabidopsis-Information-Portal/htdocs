<h2>Effect of 6-azauracil feeding on plastid differentiation in the im1 mutant.</h2><p>

The im mutant fail to differentiate chloroplasts in the majority of
their cells under high light intensity continuous illumination (REDEI
1965 1967, ROBBELEN 1968).  Chloroplast differentiation significantly
improves, when measured by pigment production, if the plants are grown
in 1-2x10E-5M 6-azauracil media.<p>

Electromicroscopic study of the cells revealed that at lower
concentrations of the analog a more or less normal chloroplast
diffentiation is restored, while at high concentrations other lamellae
in the plastids display an unusual curved shape. The size of these
platids is often larger than normal. As the large number of good size
starch granules indicate, these chloroplasts are capable of converting
sugar into starch and can perform other functions apparently well
(Figure 1).<p>

This effect of 6-azauracil is conspicuous in the mutant but it is much
reduced in the wild type.<p>
