The present paper is devoted to the study of adenylates (ATF, ADF,
AMF) accumulated in the leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana wild type
Enkheim and its mutants triplex and 58/15 during the plant ontogeny.
Triplex is a spontaneous and highly productive mutant. Its
characteristic feature is frequent occurrence of the triple pods. The
chlorophyll mutant 58/15 characterized by low productivity was
obtained by treating the developing seeds with ethyl methane sulfonate
(EMS) at the Genetic Department of the Institute of Plant Biophysics
and Physiology of the Tajik Academy of Sciences. Separation of the
nucleotides was done by the high-voltage electrophoretic method on
paper (Rogozkin, Komkova, 1961; Voskoboynikov, 1966). The quantity of
adenylates was estimated by the method of Maybaum.<p>

The results of this study are shown in Table 1. Data proved that
nucleotide composition of control plants is very labile. During their
rosette phase there is a high AMF content in the leaves of the plants
studied, and it is also present in the flowering phase of wild type
Enkheim. This appears to be connected with an intensive cell wall
sugar and polysaccharide synthesis during the period mentioned above.<p>

As the plant develops the ADF content decreases. It is in the budding
and flowering phase when there is the greatest ADF accumulation in the
plant leaves studied. This is probably due to the material
accumulation for the formation of reproductive organs.<p>

Arabidopsis thaliana race Enkheim and two mutants during their
ontogeny.<p>

Among the samples studied the triplex mutant is noted for its high
ATF, ADF and sum content of adenylates. This is likely to be connected
with a high productivity of this mutant. During the fructification
phase a decrease of the adenylate sum in the studied leaf samples is
observed. This can be explained by macroenergy compounds spend on
forming the generative organs, by the leave's aging and the
degradation of activity processes.<p>

Table 2 shows the energy charge quantity calculated by Atkinson's
formula (Metzler, 1980). Evidently, the budding and flowering phases
are characterized by the greatest quantity of energy charge, i.e.,
equilibrium in the adenylate system has a shift towards ATF formation
during these phases. Analysis of the data showed that among the
samples studied the plants of race Ehkheim occupy an intermediate
position according to the adenylate content; and according to the
quantity of energy charge, the intermediate position is held by the
chlorophyll mutant 58/15.<p>

Yakubowa et al. (1980) found that triplex and 58/15 differ from
Enkheim by high yield of photophosphorylation per unit chlorophyll.
Likely this explains the fact that the quantity of energy charge in
the leaves of mutant triplex and of low productive chlorophyll mutant
58/15 is higher than in the leaves of the wild type sample. It appears
that such a kind of an energy exchange allows the chlorophyl of 58/15
to provide itself with an synthetic energy material for the formation
of reproductive organs.<p>

Thus, the quantitative changes of components of the adenylate system
seem to be the specific character index of metabolism in the plants
reflecting the changes of biochemical processes.<p>
