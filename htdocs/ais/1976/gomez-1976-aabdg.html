The three factors, temperature, humidity and oxygen, which are known
to be universally important to promote seed germination, are also
involved at quite different levels if we wish to keep ungerminated
seeds alive for long periods of time. At present, we know that seed
longevity depends upon low temperatures, low humidities, and, perhaps
not always but most often, low oxygen pressures. With only some
limitations it could be stated that the lower the value of these
factors, the longer the conservation period.<p>

Aged seeds do not die by exhaustion of their food reserves.  In order
to be convinced of this supposition you will think of pollen grains,
whose tiny reserves are not usually consumed during the time the grain
loses its viability. The smallest of all crucifer seeds, the
Arabidopsis thaliana seed, is a giant compared with a pollen grain!
In short, seeds probably die because they poison themselves with
certain products of their very peculiar metabolism (BARTON, 1961).
Thus, longevity would result from reducing that metabolism to a
minimum, and this is the role of the above mentioned factors.<p>

Nowadays, it is possible to reduce the seed metabolism by appropriate
techniques almost to zero and to obtain conservation periods of
thousands of years. This view is strongly supported by recent records
of Lupinus seeds that conserved its viability during ten thousand
years under favourable natural conditions (PORSILD, HARINGTON, and
MULLIGAN, 1967).  Though there is no experience - it can not be - on
the long term effects of modern techniques of seed preservation; it is
believed that the expected periods might be of that length, or perhaps
longer.  In the ideal case of zero-metabolic-rate, the conservation
would be theoretically indefinite; only the accumulated damage from
cosmic rays would act as a limiting factor.<p>

Practically, the factors are much more limited and earthbound.
Temperature, for instance, cannot be lowered without raising costs in
electricity and equipment.  In large seed banks with controlled rooms,
as used for crop material, recommendations are for temperatures of
-18*degrees*C or -20*degrees*C (HONDELMANN, 1976).  Smaller seed
collections can certainly do well with only a few degrees below zero,
thus permitting the use of standard equipment as, for instance, a
house or industrial refrigerator.  An additional advantage of using
not very low temperatures derives from the fact that seeds can be
destroyed by freezing when their water content is normal to high
(ROBERTS, 1972, 1975).  Even if they are previously desiccated, any
accidental failure which raises again their moisture to the original
levels can be fatal at i.e., -30*degrees*C while it will not produce
any harm at -10*degrees*C. The ability to withstand low temperatures
also depends upon the species. Cruciferae are on the safer side,
largely because they have a higher oil content than average, and this
associated to lower contant of water.<p>

Deep freezing methods will not necessarily harm the seed, as long as
freezing is achieved in very short time and with due percautions
(SAKAI and NOSHIRO, 1975).  Seed conservation in liquid nitrogen
(-196*degrees*C) only has against it the high costs involved when it
it planned for long periods.<p>

Humidity itself must be low, but it is said that an excessive
desiccation below -2*degrees*C (ROBERTS, 1972) can produce damage by
removing monolayer or bound water.  The values which can be reached
through the use of chemical desiccants like calcium chloride or silica
gel are plainly satisfactory.  Silica gel can reduce the moisture
content of cereal grains from an original 10-12% down to about 4-5% in
a few days.  For oily seeds like those from crucifers, an original
value from 7-8% can be lowered by the same procedure down to 3-4%.
The method involves a great advantage as an alternative to the dangers
of desiccation by direct heat.  It is, however, limited by economic
reasons when large mass of grains are to be desiccated, and this may
prevent its use in crop seed banks. The problem does into certainly
exist for small seed collection, where the simultaneous use of
desiccation with silica gel and storage at a low temperature provides
an almost ideal situation (Figure 1).<p>

situations are expressed: 1. Storage at cold temperature, 2.
Desiccation (with silica gel) only, 3.  Low temperature and
desiccation combined, as it is exemplified by the crucifer seed bank
described in this article, 4. Storage in liquid nitrogen, 5.
Lyophilisation.<p>

Vacuum represents another possiblity for simultaneous elimination of
humidity and oxygen.  It has often been used to preserve pollen
grains. Whenever possible (only small seeds with low original
humidity) lyophilisation might be of practical use, but it may produce
dangerous levels of desiccation.<p>

The temperature-humidity diagram of Figure 1, exemplifies several
situations of conservation.  Values are only approximate and they are
referred to an oily seed where the prestorage conditions are
20*degrees*C (room temperature) and 8% water content.  According to
HARRINGTON's (1970, 1972) laws, a decrease of either 5 *degrees*C in
temperature of 1% in relative humidity, can independently extend seed
longevity by a factor of two. The validity of these laws is subjected
to limitations and they seemed to have mostly been tested for above
0*degrees*C temperatures.  In the absence of data for sub-zero
temperatures (which would mean too long periods to be experimentally
measured), they can be, however, tentatively extrapolated as the only
method at hand to estimate expected seed longevities under
conservation.<p>

The significance of the conservation factor oxygen is diverse.  Low
oxygen is valuable at least in many cases (HARRINGTON, 1970).  It may
help to prevent the oxydation of lipids under conditions of very llow
moisture content.  It may also have a role as a redundant factor to be
used in combination with temperature and/or humidity, to minimize the
injury by accidental failures (as, i.e., a blackout) inovlving the
other factors.<p>

For application of the ideas which are summarized above, I would like
to refer to a crucifer seed collection that has been elaborated in our
laboratory during the past few years (GOMEZ-CAMPO, 1972).  The
conservation procedure is based on the following criteria:<p>

1) The simultaneous use of low temperature (cold room at
-5*degrees*C), low humidity (about 3.5%), and low oxygen (atmosphere
is changed by carbon dioxide).<p>

2) The presence of an amount of silica gel within each seed capsule.
This serves not only to reduce slowly and safely the seed moisture,
but also to maintain it in lthe future.<p>

3) The use of individual capsules for each sub-sample, each containing
from twelve to one hundred seeds according to its size.  Capsules are
usually made from glass tubes 7 mm in diameter, and only for the
smaller seeds as those of Arabidopsis 5 mm tubes are used.  One
hundred capsules are made for each taxon (or population) so that no
change in the storage are to be expected from the removal of
subsamples for use.<p>

4) The use of flame sealing to achieve a reliable hermeticity within
each capsule. Any pore or other improbable accident would be
immediately shown by a colour change from blue to pink in the silica
gel.<p>

One drained person can deal in one working day with the cleaning,
encapsulation and labelling of one taxon (100 capsules).  Without any
mechanization, the procedure had been used for about 500 crucifer taxa
in October 1976.  Presently, some improvements saving labor are being
tested for application in a second collection of rare and endemic
Iberian species.<p>

The main significance of these collection is: 1) to make available for
research or applied purposes a wide number of difficult-to-obtain taxa
in the form of living plant material, and 2) to protect some
endangered endemics from extinction by maintaining parallel seed
stocks alive.<p>
