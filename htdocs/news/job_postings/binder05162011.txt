A postdoctoral position is available starting as soon as possible to study ethylene signal 
transduction mechanisms and responses in plants. Research will be conducted in the 
Binder lab that is located in the newly remodeled Hesler Biology Building on the campus 
of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. More information about this research can be 
found at the lab website- http://www.bio.utk.edu/binderlab/. Candidates must possess a 
Ph.D. in biology, molecular biology, biochemistry or related field and be familiar with 
techniques such as: PCR, RT-PCR, genetic crosses and genotyping of plants, primer 
design, site-directed mutagenesis, cloning and sub-cloning, transformation of plant and 
yeast. Candidates must be able to work well in a collaborative environment and have 
excellent oral and written English language communication skills. Ideal candidate is 
already familiar working with Arabidopsis thaliana. Familiarity with protein purification 
methods and analyses a plus. Primary duties will include conducting research on ethylene 
signal transduction using a combination of molecular biology, biochemistry, and 
physiology. Additional duties include helping to supervise research in the lab including 
undergraduates conducting independent research projects. The successful applicant is 
expected to be self-motivated and demonstrate a high degree of research productivity. 
Interested candidates should e-mail curriculum vitae, statement of research interests, and 
contact information for three references to: Dr. Brad Binder at bbinder@utk.edu with 
"Postdoc 2011" in the subject line. Applications will be accepted until the position is 
filled.
