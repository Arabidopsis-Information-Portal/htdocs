If you join my laboratory, you will be focused on understanding how plants perceive and integrate 
stress signals. To achieve this goal, you will study the priming phenomenon in the model plant 
Arabidopsis thaliana. Recent researches with the priming agent beta-aminobutyric acid were published 
in international peer-reviewed journals such as the Journal of Experimental Botany (Wu et al., 2010) 
and The Plant Journal (Chai et al., early online preview, 2011). By joining my laboratory, you may 
also participate in research projects aimed at the identification and characterization of genes 
associated with the Arabidopsis response to pathogens. Proven ability to write and speak English is 
desirable. Chinese language skills are not required. Interested applicants should contact Dr. Laurent 
Zimmerli at lauzim2@ntu.edu.tw to arrange for an interview.

The National Taiwan University is a renowned university in Asia and provides excellent conditions for 
research. This university is located in Taipei, a vibrant and amazing city.
