<p>We are pleased to announce TAIR's  
                <a href="/home.html">new website</a>. In addition to a complete redesign of the layout for the website, we have implemented several new features.</p>
	  <p>Features of our redesigned site include:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Easier navigation between web pages.<br>
		- Toolbar lets you move between pages with fewer intermediate links.
		<li>Links between related pages are more logical, making it easier to find information.<br>
		    - Major site categories are AGI Information, External Links, <I>Arabidopsis</I> Information, News, and Tools.
			<li>Access to TAIR database development documentation and schema.
			    <li>New Features - Searchable FAQs, Extended help pages, Job Postings, and Community Search.
				</ul>
	     <p>We have also updated our Database and MapViewer. Please see the release notes to get the latest information on these tools.

              <p> Acknowledgement of AtDB's Illustra database: 
              <ul>
                AtDB's Illustra Database went offline on November 17, 2000. We would like to thank Mike Cherry, Gail Binkley, and Mark Schroeder at SGD for keeping up AtDB's Illustra Database since the AtDB project ended. Their incredible support and generosity were essential for the smooth transition from AtDB to TAIR.
