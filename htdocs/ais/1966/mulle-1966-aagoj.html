	Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana were trated with ehtyl methanesulfonate (EMS).  The dependence of the growth rate of primary roots and other somatic effects, fertility of M1 plants, and frequency of recessive lethals (embryonic lethals and chlorophyll mutations) on the mutagen dose and various treatment conditions was studied.  The main results are:<p>

	1.  With increasing dose the frequency of chlorophyll mutations and the frequency of embryonic lethals increase exponentially (n~2).  This applies as well to variation of EMS concentration as to variation of treatment time.<p>

	2.  Mutation frequency, sterility, and root length reduction increase by raising the treatment temperature. For the range tested (18*degrees*-36*degrees*C) a temperature quotient of Q10=2.6 was found.<p>

	3.  The increase of mutation frequency is limited only by the decrease of fertility of M1-plants and not by a decrease of survival.  The relations between mutation frequency, degree of sterility, and root length reduction are not influenced by changing the treatment conditions.<p>

	4.  Mutation frequency, sterility, and root length reduction are independent of the duration of soaking of the treated seeds in water under partially anaerobic conditions.  Delaying the start of germination up to 4 days after treatment does not influence the mutation frequency.<p>

	5.  By raising the temperature during a period of 6 h after treatment mutation frequency sterility, and root length reduction are increased.<p>

	6.  The damage caused by drying seeds after EMS treatment is reduced completely by soaking the treated seeds in water for 11 h before drying.<p>

	7.  The effectiveness of partially hydrolyzed EMS solutions corresponds to the concentration of EMS.  Physiological damage caused by the hydrolysis products is without practical significance.<p>

	8.  The relations between various estimates of mutation frequency (frequency of segregating plant progenies, frequency of segregating pod progenies, frequency of M2-mutants) have been analyzed.  It is shown that there is no direct proportionality between the frequency of M2-mutants (mc) and the initial mutation frequency.<p>

	A detailed publication on the subject is prepared in the journal "Zuchter".<p>
