It is well known that some organic compounds increase the resistance
of the organisms against the damage induced by ionizing radiations.
Several workers are studying the mechanism of radioprotection at
several stages of the DNA synthesis.  Our purpose was to compare the
action of X-irradiation on the DNA content of the resting nuclei of
Arabidopsis thaliana after treatment by a radioprotector, the
cysteamine (s-mercaptoethylamine).  The behaviour of diploid and
tetraploid strains was also compared.<p>

We have used the roots of young seedlings of diploid and tetraploid
Arabidopsis, after a five day germination of the seeds on wet filter
paper.  The dosis of X-rays was 20,000 R, this is the lethal dosis for
a high proportion of the seedlings. The concentration of cysteamine
was 0.01%; the soaking of the filter paper by that solution for 24
hours did not reduce the vitality and the growing of the seedlings.
For each chromosome type, four items were compared: control plants,
treatment by the radioprotector, irradiated material and treatment by
cysteamine followed by irradiation. The seedlings were fixed in
acetic-alcohol immedately after the treatment and stored in 70%
alcohol. The roots were stained according to the classical Feulgen
technique and squashed in a drop of 50% acetic acid. The squashed were
made permanent by dehydration and mounting in Canadabalsam.<p>

The Barr and Stroud integrating microdensitometer was used for
measuring the relative quantity of DNA in the nuclei.  That estimation
was done by comparing the relative absorption of light in the nuclei
and in the surrounding cytoplasm.  One hundred nuclei were measured
for each item and their distribution in terms of relative absorption
is reported in Fig. 1.  The number of available nuclei in a root
meristem of Arabidopsis is relatively low and, on the other hand, the
absorption of the light is very poor, because of the small size of the
chromosomes in regard to the nucleus volume. The upper left diagram
shows (white and dotted parts) the distribution of the nuclei in
control seedlings. The discrimination between the peaks corresponding
to the G1 and G2 stages is not very clear; these peaks were noted for
4 and 8 arbitrary units of absorption.  An absorption of about 8 units
was always observed for prophase and metaphase nuclei, 4 units
corresponding to the DNA content in anaphase and telophase. The G1 and
G2 nuclei were more distinct in the tetraploid seedlings (lower left
diagram) and the peaks indicated a double amount of DNA (8 and 16
units respectively).<p>

(arbitrary units of light absorption) in diploid (upper diagrams) and
tetraploid Arabidopsis (lower diagrams)<p>

The seedlings fixed after irradiation showed a very clear accumulation
of the nuclei in G1, in tetraploid as well as in diploid plants (dark
and dotted parts of the diagrams).  Very few nuclei showed an
absorption corresponding to the G2 phase.<p>

The right part of the Fig. 1 shows, for diploid and tetraploid plants,
the results of measurements performed in seedlings treated by
cysteamine (white) and irradiated after the treatment by the
radioprotector (dark).  The distribution of the nuclei was similar in
the control and in the plants only treated by cysteamine.  On the
other hand, the pretreatment by cysteamine has concealed the effect of
X-rays since both peaks are visible again; the two distributions are
similar, in spite of a light shifting of the G2 peaks to the left
after irradiation.<p>

Table 1:  Mean absorption rates (arbitrary units)<p>

The mean absorption values have been compared by analysis of variance
and the means are reported in Table 1.  The comparisons did not show
any significant differences between control and plants treated by
cysteamine as well as between "cysteamine" and "cysteamine and
X-rays", in diploid and tetraploid strains.  On the contrary, the
differences between control and iradiated seedlings were very highly
significant.<p>

It may be concluded, from Fig. 1 and Table 1, that the DNA content in
irradiated plant was similar to the G1 peak of the control.  The
effect of the cysteamine was very effective at the considered point of
view, since a normal distribution was maintained after irradiation.
The radioprotection was perhaps not perfect, since the G2 peaks for
irradiated plants were a little shifted to the left in comparison to
the unirradiated ones.  That shifting was responsible for a light
reduction of the general means; the decrease of the means was not
statistically significant, but it was observed in diploid and in
tetraploid strains. Thus the irradiation seemed to block the nuclei at
the G1 stage, the disappearance of the G2 nuclei being possible during
the time of irradiation (75 min).  The cysteamine gave an almost
normal distribution of the nuclei in irradiated seedlings.  These
results may be interpreted as a true radioprotective effect of the
cysteamine which would allow DNA synthesis after irradiation and the
producion of new G2 nuclei. But the presence of the second peak in
irradiated material may also be the consequence of a decrease of the
mitotic activity induced by the cysteamine; according to that second
interpretation, the G2 nuclei would be nuclei which have not had the
opportunity of completing their mitosis during the irradiation time.<p>
