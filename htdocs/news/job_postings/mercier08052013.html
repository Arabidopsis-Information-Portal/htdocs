<p>A post-doc position is available in my team (INRA IPB, Versailles France)
    on the ERC project MeioSight (2012-2016).</p>
<p>Key words: meiosis, Arabidopsis, mutant, genetic screens, recombination,
    cell cycle, chromosome segregation, cytology</p>
<p>Meiosis is an essential stage in the life cycle of sexually-reproducing
    organisms. Indeed, meiosis is the specialized cell division that reduces the
    number of chromosomes from two sets in the parent to one set in gametes,
    while fertilization restores the original chromosome number. Meiosis is also
    the stage of development when genetic recombination occurs, thus being the
    heart of Mendelian heredity. Increasing our knowledge on meiotic mechanisms,
    in addition to its intrinsic interest, would have also important
    implications for agriculture and medicine.</p>
<p>In the last decade, Arabidopsis emerged as a very good model to study
    meiosis, notably because of the possibility of large scale genetic studies
    and a wide range of molecular and cytological tools. In this project we aim
    to isolate a large number of novel genes through innovative genetic screens,
    and characterize their functions in an integrated manner. This will allow us
    to push far beyond the current knowledge about all aspects of meiosis,
    including recombination, cell cycle and sister chromatid cohesion.</p>
<p>The recruited post-doc will be in charge of: (i) Functional
    characterization of new genes that we recently identified. These genes are
    involved in the regulation of the formation/fate of DNA double strand breaks
    that initiates meiotic recombination. (ii) Running new suppressor screens
    (the population to be phenotypically screened being ready), looking for
    controllers of recombination and/or chromosome segregation at meiosis.</p>
<p>The contract should start between October and December 2013 and finish in
    December 2016.</p>

    Further inquiries should be addressed to Raphael Mercier (<a
        href='mailto:raphael.mercier@versailles.inra.fr'>raphael.mercier@versailles.inra.fr</a>).
    The application should include CV, a brief letter of motivation, and contact
    information for at least two referees.
