RIKEN Plant Science Center engages in research and development to improve plant 
productivity for sustainable agriculture. The area of focus covers growth 
regulation, resistance to environmental stresses and pathogens, and metabolic 
regulation. We employ advanced genomic technologies to investigate functions of 
genes, proteins and metabolites in plants and elucidate their regulatory
