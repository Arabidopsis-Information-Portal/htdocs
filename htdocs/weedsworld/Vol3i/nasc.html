<H3>INRA-Versailles lines become available</H3>
<BR>
The first 1400 lines kindly donated by George Pelletier and Nicole Bechtold
are now available from NASC.  Detailed information about the individual
lines, including segregation data, observed mutant phenotypes and GUS staining
patterns are available from the <A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk">NASC WWW server</A>. The lines are available as pools of <A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Versailles/versailles_20_pools.html">20 lines</A> or <A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Versailles/versailles_100_pools.html">100 lines</A>. <BR>
<BR>
Before seed can be sent to you it is necessary that the recipient sign a
release agreement with INRA. The <A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Versailles/INRA_release.html">release form</A> is available from the NASC
server and can be printed out for signing. Simply place your order through
the NASC server using the special <A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/versaillesorder.html">order form</A> for INRA lines (or whichever
way you prefer to place orders), and mail or fax the agreement to NASC in
order to receive the seeds.  If you have problems getting the INRA release
form  through the WWW, contact NASC and a hard copy agreement will be mailed
to you.   <BR>
<BR>
A  detailed review of the generation and characterisation of these lines
has been written by George Pelletier and Nicole Bechtold and is carried
in a previous issue of <A HREF="../Vol2ii/pelletier.html">Weeds World</A> and is also <A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Versailles/About_Versailles_lines.html">carried</A> alongside the information
on the NASC server.<BR>
<BR>
The stock code for the complete set of 20 pools is N5388.<BR>
The stock code for the complete set of 100 pools is N5389<BR>
<BR>
We would encourage you where possible to order the pools of 100
lines. <P>

<H3>NASC WWW server upgrade</H3>
<BR>
First, I would like to introduce Mike Arnold, who has recently joined the
NASC project. He will be responsible for the maintenance and development
of the NASC WWW server. This part of our activities is EU funded and has
allowed us to significantly upgrade to a new server. We have switched to
the new machine and I hope that you will have already noticed that this
allows a much better connection to our information services.<BR>
<BR>
New developments to the WWW server are in progress and news of these will
be posted to the arab-gen bulletin board and newsgroup. A full demonstration 
will be available at the upcoming Arabidopsis conference in June.<BR>
