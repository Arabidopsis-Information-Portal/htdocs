	The ABRC is pleased to report that many new seed and DNA 
stocks are being added to the collection, stocks are being 
distributed at increasing rates and implementation of the AIMS 
database is in its final phases. Following is a brief summary of
our recent activities.  <P>    

     The seed stock collections are rapidly increasing, and many of 
the additions will be incorporated into the next catalog, which is
expected  to be distributed around Jan. 1, 1995.  We have nearly
finished growing the  ecotype collection of Dr. A. R. Kranz,
including the isolation of single-seed lines from each population. 
The donations resulting from the spring, 1994 stock donation
campaign will be available, as will transposon lines and all 300
recombinant inbred lines from the  Caroline Dean lab, by way of the
Nottingham Centre.  The latest  batch of Kenneth Feldmann T-DNA
pools, 1600 in total, have  recently been released.  In cooperation
with NASC, we will be  initiating a new seed donation drive soon. 
However, feel free to  donate seeds at any time!  Cooperation of
seed donors has been  great, but there are still many published
stocks out there that we  would be most pleased to have available
for the benefit of everyone in the Arabidopsis community.       <P>

	The biggest development on the DNA front is the rapid 
expansion of the EST holdings of the Center.  Nearly 5000 clones 
from the MSU project and 1000 ESTs of the CNRS groups are 
currently held at ABRC.  The demand for these clones is 
accelerating rapidly.  Particularly, orders from researchers 
working with species completely outside the plant community as 
well as individuals focusing on other plants are increasing.  The
pursuit of new clone donations has paid off with  the acquisition
of a number of cloned genes, all of which will be  included in the
upcoming catalog.  Two important research resources  were recently
donated to the Center.  The first of these is the two-hybrid
library provided by Dr. John Walker.  Distribution of this stock as
a kit was recently initiated, and demand has already  surpassed the
initial reserves of this item.  Also, a P1 phage  library has just
been received from Mitsui Plant Biotechnology Research Institute
and RITE.  It will be some time  before this stock will
be available for distribution, as the  preparation and storage will
require substantial labor and equipment.  <P>     

	Many of you have been requesting EST clones from the ABRC DNA
stock collections, and presumably using them for your studies. As
the vast majority of these clones have not been checked by us at the
Center, it is important that you take the time to sequence these
clones prior to use, to confirm their identity. We would greatly
appreciate being informed of your sequencing results, which can
then be shared. Sequencing results can be sent to us electronically
at: dna@genesys.cps.msu.edu  <P>

	The stock centers are also interested to learn of research
successes in which our stocks have been utilized, especially developments of a practical nature (like in this <a href="weeds4.GIF">illustration?</a>). <P>

	We are working with NASC to develop image files for all
stocks. These will be available via the databases and gopher.  The
ABRC contributions to this information will be made available
electronically as they are generated during next several weeks.  We
hope that these will be useful to researchers in the evaluation of
stocks of the centers. <P>

     Starting in September 1994, the order histories of all seed
and DNA stocks  are being made available on the AIMS database. 
Specifically,   orders to ABRC and NASC filled after Sept. 20, 1994
are being recorded on the  system, as well as all EST orders. 
These can be  queried by stock number in the AIMS ordering system,
or searched  by other criteria in the AIMS database.  It is hoped
that this  service will foster cooperation among individuals with
common  interests.  <P>     

	We are also interested in feedback on results of experiments
involving seed stocks.  In particular the individual Feldmann
lines, which were identified as having specific phenotypic
characteristics, have been sent to many individuals.  We would be
very interested to learn which ones are actually tagged and which
are not.  This information can also be made available through the
databases, the stock center catalogues and Weeds World.  If
feedback on all aspects of stock characteristics and utilization is
forwarded to the centers, it will be of great benefit to
Arabidopsis researchers.   <P> 

     The development of AIMS is entering the final stages.  The 
new system went on-line in April, and the implementation of data 
input tools is nearly complete.  With these tasks finished, it is 
expected that the database can be kept current for all data
categories.  All ESTs are now incorporated, with the current 
availability status included.  The ABRC mailing list, residing on 
AIMS, now numbers over 2000 individuals and is updated weekly.  The 
reference section contains over 4500 entries.  With these tasks
underway, we are now concentrating on  making the interface more
user friendly.  The first step in this  endeavor is the development
of an ordering system that is  completely graphical.  Three new
choices of access have been developed, with  the most popular
expected to be the Mosaic interface.  To use this system, just
connect to the AIMS main page (url http://aims.cps.msu.edu/aims/), 
and then enter login and stock
numbers in appropriate windows.  A click of the mouse then places
orders instantaneously with either ABRC or NASC.  Direct  links to
NASC, AAtDB and NCBI home pages also are incorporated  so that the
main databases of Arabidopsis research are within a  click of the
AIMS home page.  In the near future, similar Mosaic access  to the
entire database will be implemented so that all AIMS  data can be
accessed via the World Wide Web.  It is anticipated that it will
take some time to complete this project.  When this is 
accomplished, an announcement will be made on the Arabidopsis 
newsgroup.      <P>    

If you have any questions about ABRC services or stocks, feel 
free to contact us.  We also stand ready to assist you in any way 
we can.
