One postdoctoral position is immediately available (or starting within the  
next three months) to study RNA silencing in plants. The research mainly  
focuses on biological functions and molecular events of RNA-induced  
silencing complexes (RISCs) in Arabidopsis. We are particularly interested  
in understanding biochemical mechanism by which Arabidopsis RISCs are  
assembled, dissembled, and functionally specialized corresponding to  
endogenous development cues and exogenous environmental stimuli. One of our  
projects is following up work from our recent publication (Zhu, et al.,  
Arabidopsis Argonaute10 Specifically Sequesters miR166/165 to Regulate Shoot  
Apical Meristem Development. Cell 145, 242-256, April 15, 2011).  
 
   
 
Applicants process a fresh Ph.D. degree with strong background and excellent  
publication records in biochemistry and molecular biology. Candidates should  
be highly motivated and possess creativity and initiative. Experience in  
protein purification in various organisms, protein-protein, or protein-RNA  
interaction will be a plus.  
 
   
 
The initial appointments are for 2-3 years and the renewals are highly  
possible, depending on the performance of the individuals. Salary will be  
competitive and commensurate with experience. Interested applicants should  
send a CV, brief summary of research experience, and contact information for  
at least two references by email to Xiuren Zhang at xiuren.zhang@tamu.edu.
