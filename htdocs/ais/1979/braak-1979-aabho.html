After previous communications about the revertants of B25 (Braaksma
and Feenstra, 1975; Feenstra and Braaksma, 1976) some more data were
obtained. Summarizing we can say that all 7 independently arisen
revertants are characterized by the following features: 1) good growth
on a medium with nitrate as the sole nitrogen source, 2) chlorate
sensitivity, 3) nitrate reductase activity, from 1/2-2 times wildtype
activity, 4) about the same level of nitrite reductase activity and
nitrate content as the wild type (B25 has both extemely high), 5)
nitrate reductase having the same Km for NADH and nitrate as that of
the wildtype, 6) nitrate reductase, which is electrophoretically
indistinguishable from nitrate reductase of the wildtype, 7) cyt c
reductase having a wildtype pattern after glucose gradient
centrifugation (see also our other paper in this issue of AIS). In all
cases a suppressor mutation, independently segregating from the rgn
gene (the mutated gene of B25, Feenstra and Braaksma, 1976) is
responsible for the reversion.<p>

There are two different criteria for reversion: 1) good growth on a
nitrate medium and 2) sensitive to chlorate. A remarkable fact is that
the suppressors su-3 and su-4 happen to be recessive for both
criteria, while the suppressors su-2 and su-7 are dominant for both
criteria, and su-1, and su-5 and su-6 turned out to be recessive when
tested for chlorate sensitivity and dominant for growth on a nitrate
medium. Complementation tests showed for the suppressors that could be
tested (su-1, su-3, su-4, su-5, su-6) that they are allelic. No
complementation tests could be done with the dominant su-2 ans su-7,
but we intensively tested whether any crossing-over took place between
su-2 and su-7 or between one of these and the other su mutations. No
crossing-over has been ovserved, so that su-2 and su-7 probably are
allelic with the other suppressor mutations. How it is possible that
the same gene yields dominant, semi-dominant and recessive suppressor
mutations is not yet understood.<p>

The fact that the characteristics of NAR in all revertants are
indistinguishable from wildtype, suggests that the primary mutation in
mutant B25 is not in a DNA sequence determining the functioning of the
apo-enzyme in the reduction of nitrate. This is in accordance with the
results given in our accompanying paper, which suggest that mutant B25
either lacks a functioning cofactor or that some controlling mechanism
is involved. Whatever may be the case, the block in mutant B25 can be
undone by different mutations in a separate gene, su.<p>
