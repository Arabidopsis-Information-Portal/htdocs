Session 1: Cell Growth (Cell cycle/Cell death)</H1>

<P>This session covered several aspects of growth control in plants. Cell
cycle regulation was discussed in relation to quantitative growth control
as well as in developmental processes. These talks illustrated the distinct
relationship of cell division and growth in plants when compared to other
biological model systems. Regulated cell death plays a crucial role in
plant defense responses and the recent isolation of genes implicated in
these programs will accelerate the mechanistic analysis of the death program
in plants. This session included three short communications highlighting
posters presented at the meeting.

<P>Peter Doerner, La Jolla, discussed the role of cell division in controlling
root growth. In Arabidopsis, root growth accelerates two-fold when nitrogen
availability is low. This leads to an increase of meristem size, measured
by examining cell size and number in the root apex. However, this increase
in the cycling population is not sufficient to quantitatively account for
the enhanced overall growth rate. By counting cells that express a cyclin::GUS
fusion, Doerner argued that a discrepancy between observed and predicted
numbers indicated that the G2 phase of the cell cycle was truncated under
these conditions. One prediction of this hypothesis was confirmed by the
observation that proliferating cells in the rapidly growing root divided
at a smaller size than equivalent cells in slower growing roots. Doerner
proposed that control over the rate of cell cycle progression in G2 is
a mechanism by which nutritional signals function in growth regulation.

<P>Dirk Inze, Ghent, discussed the role of cyclin-dependent kinase genes
in plant cell cycle regulation. Two CDK genes, <I>cdc2a</I> and <I>cdc2b</I>
have been identified in <I>Arabidopsis</I>, with the former functioning
throughout the cell cycle, the latter primarily at the G2/M transition.
Cdc2b RNA levels as well as p35<FONT SIZE=-2>cdc2bAt</FONT>-dependent histone
H1 kinase activity peaks at the G2/M transition. In two-hybrid experiments,
B-type cyclins were found to interact with the protein encoded by <I>cdc2b</I>
while the G1-type D cyclins interacted with p34<FONT SIZE=-2>cdc2aAt</FONT>,
encoded by <I>cdc2a</I>. Two-hybrid screens also resulted in the isolation
of an <I>Arabidopsis</I> <I>CKS1</I> homolog, proteins which are thought
to mediate interactions of the CDK complex with other proteins. Expression
of the <I>CKS1</I> homolog was found to be high in all dividing cells but
also in cells undergoing endoreduplication. It was proposed that CKS1 functions
in this process.

<P>Bob Dietrich, Chapel Hill, presented recent work on the <I>lsd1</I>
mutant. LSD1 appears to be required to maintain cell viability, in the
<I>lsd1</I> mutant lesions are produced affected leaves in which spread
unchecked after induction and kill the entire affected leaf. The <I>LSD1</I>
gene has no overall homology to any known genes. However, the corresponding
protein contains three tandem zinc finger domains, raising the possibility
that LSD1 may be a transcription factor. Current experiments focus on the
functional analysis of LSD1, taking advantage of a null background for
structure-function experiments with various deletion and point mutations
of <I>LSD1</I>. A screen is underway to identify differences in gene expression
between the <I>LSD1</I> and <I>lsd1</I> lines, based on the rationale that
LSD1 might be a transcription factor. Concurrently, a yeast two hybrid
screen is being used to identify proteins that interact with LSD1. In addition,
a genetic screen to identify second-site suppressors is in progress to
identify other genes which function in the LSD1 pathway.

<P>Bill Crosby, Saskatoon, discussed how protein interactions involving
the floral homeotic gene <I>UFO</I> suggest a role for selective cell cycle
control during floral morphogenesis. Loss-of-function mutations in the
<I>UFO</I> (unidentified floral organs) gene result in variably aberrant
second and third whorl organs as well as defects in the transition from
vegetative to floral development such that additional flower-like structures
are generated in the place of individual inflorescences. Two-hybrid screens
with UFO as bait resulted in the isolation of a class of interacting proteins
(UIP for UFO-interacting protein) which show significant homology to the
yeast cell cycle regulator SKP1. <I>In-situ</I> hybridization results show
that UFO and UIPs are co-expressed in the same cells early during floral
development. Crosby proposed that the role of UFO is to negatively regulate
cell cycle progression mediated by an inhibition of UIP (SKP1) function.

<P>Chun-Ming Liu, Stillwater, discussed three titan mutants. These mutants
are defective in karyokinesis and form endosperm nuclei up to 100 times
larger than the wild-type. Chromosome condensation has been observed in
all <I>titan</I> mutants, while mitotic figures have only been seen in
<I>titan3</I>. Development of <I>titan1</I> and <I>titan2</I> embryos is
arrested at the 1-2 cell stage, whereas <I>titan3</I> can produce fertile
homozygous mutant plants. The <I>TITAN1</I>, <I>TITAN2</I> and <I>TITAN3</I>
genes have been mapped to chromosomal 2, 1 and 5, respectively and progress
towards their cloning is being made.

<P>Raymond DiDonato, Boston, discussed the <I>alf4-1</I> mutant which fails
to develop lateral roots even when treated with exogenous IAA. These plants
appear to be defective in the early stages of pericycle cell division.
To examine cell division patterns in these mutants, we constructed transgenic
lines of WT and <I>alf4-1</I> plants containing a B cyclin (cyc1At) promoter
fused to the GUS gene. Compared to WT, <I>alf4-1</I> plants exhibit greatly
decreased GUS staining in the root tip and pericycle cells, even when treated
with IAA. These observations are consistent with the notion that <I>alf4-1</I>
mutants are defective in the early stages of pericycle cell division. We
also mutagenized a WT line containing the cyc1At-GUS fusion construct to
find plants displaying altered staining patterns. Two recessive,<I> xcl</I>-
(extra cyclin levels) mutants were isolated which display a marked increase
in staining levels in the roots, through the elongation zone and root shoot
junction, and throughout all leaves.
