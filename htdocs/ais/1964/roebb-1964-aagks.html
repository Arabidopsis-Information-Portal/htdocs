Vol 01:<h2>ROBBELEN, G.</h2><h2>Futile attempts of mutation induction with some base analogues and antimetabolites</h2>

With reference to the experiences in microorganism some years ago
mutation experiments had been conducted, the negative result of which
might be of value for those interested in similar subjects.  Base
analogues and antimetabolites have been applied in concentrations up
to sublethal ones (about 10% survival), using treatments of dry seeds
or buds, the latter with the tongue slit method (cf. ROBBELEN 1962c).<p>

Table: Mutagenic treatment of seeds and buds.

Though the primary action on the M1-plant development was more or less
drastic, the increase of the spontaneous mutation rate (this being
about 0.1% measured in the M2 chlorophyll-mutation test) was only low
and in no instance specific.  These results, being summarized in the
following table apparently point towards the fact, that in higher
plants the pool of DNA precursors can hardly be depleted in this way,
to achieve specific genetic effects.<p>
