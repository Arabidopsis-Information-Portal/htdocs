The VIB Department Plant Systems Biology at the University of Ghent has an 
immediate opening for One Post Doctoral position in the group of Dr. Jenny 
Russinova to work on the VIB collaborative IWT “Strategisch Basis 
Onderzoek” project “Protein interference by targeted protein aggregation” 
The aim of the proposed research is to develop a generic method to 
knockout protein function by specifically inducing precipitation of a 
target protein in all type of organisms including bacteria, fungi, plants 
and vertebrates. In our lab we aim to adapt the protein aggregation 
knockout technology as a complementary to the known targeted mutagenesis 
approaches (e.g. homologous recombination, RNAi, miRNA) and to generated 
transgenic knockout plants, which will allow functional characterization 
of individual gene on interest. We will apply this technology on different 
components of brassinosteroid signaling pathway. 
The project is carried out by a consortium of 5 VIB labs with a strong 
reputation in the appropriate fields, Switch laboratory (Dr. Joost 
Schymkowitz and Dr. Frederic Rousseau), VIB3 (Prof. Peter Carmeliet), VIB2 
(Prof. Dirk Inze), Dr.Patrick Van Dijck and Dr. Johan Van Eldere, KUL. 
We are looking for a motivated and hard working young scientist with a 
solid background in biochemistry, cell and molecular biology and a nice 
and collegial working spirit. Experience with plants, Arabidopsis, GFP and 
microscopy is an advantage but not required. 
Send your CV, motivation letter and names and email addresses of two 
referees to Jenny Russinova (eurus@psb.vib-ugent.be). 
For more information about the project, please contact Dr. Jenny Russinova 
(09/3313931; eurus@psb.vib-ugent.be) or Prof. Dr. Dirk Inzé (09/3313806; 
diinz@psb.vib-ugent.be).
