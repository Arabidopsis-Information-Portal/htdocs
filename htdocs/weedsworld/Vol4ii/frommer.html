The session on Plant Cell Biology highlighted recent developments in this
increasingly important and exciting research area which establishes links
between fields as diverse as development and physiology. The first talk
by Richard Meagher from Athens, GA presented an excellent overview on the
different isoforms of actin present in <I>Arabidopsis</I>. Using a variety
of elegant approaches, including antisera specific for different isoforms,
he demonstrated that the family of highly related actin genes contains
divergent members which differ in patterns of expression and, presumably,
functions. For example, two distinct subclasses <I>(ACT2 &amp; ACT8; ACT7)</I>
make up the vegetative class, whereas three distinct subclasses <I>(ACT11;
ACT1 &amp; 3; ACT4 &amp; 12)</I> make up the reproductive class. Even within
a class, the genes are differentially expressed. Data from the genome project
together with knock-out mutants will soon provide us with an almost complete
picture of the role and function of different actin genes.

<P>The second talk by Hui-Ju Wu from Michel Delseny&acute;s lab in Perpignan
described the cloning of an <I>Arabidopsis</I> gene complementing the yeast
<I>sac1</I> mutant which is affected in the organisation of the actin cytoskeleton.
Although AtG5 restores growth of yeast <I>sac1</I> mutants at the restrictive
temperature, its function in plants remains to be investigated.

<P>Gerd J&uuml;rgens from T&uuml;bingen discussed the role of the KNOLLE
protein in cytokinesis. The <I>KNOLLE</I> gene was originally identified
by mutations affecting embryo development and was found to encode a protein
related to vesicle-docking proteins of the syntaxin family. Evidence from
detailed biochemical and cell biological analyses suggest that KNOLLE is
specifically involved in the fusion of membrane vesicles that form the
cell plate during cell division. Since <I>knolle</I> null mutations impair
but do not completely block cell plate formation, future studies are directed
toward the identification of other components involved in cytokinesis.

<P>In addition to its role in cell division, the cytoskeleton is involved
in other functions, such as the transport of mRNAs and proteins within
and between cells, e.g. through plasmodesmata. Addressing this topic, Patricia
Zambryski from Berkeley showed that virus can move between cells through
plasmodesmata and that viral movement proteins can enlarge the pores. She
also demonstrated that the cytoskeleton is necessary for macromolecular
trafficking of protein and virus.<B> </B>These findings suggest that a
plant system for transporting proteins between cells is misused by the
virus. Transport of endogenous proteins was discussed in the last two talks
which addressed the accumulation of proteins in enucleate sieve elements
of the phloem. Jennifer Gottwald from Mike Sussman&acute;s group in Madison
presented her approach of studying the function of P-proteins in the phloem.
Database searches had revealed a P-protein ortholog in Arabidopsis. Using
a PCR-based reverse genetics approach, Jennifer identified a T-DNA insertion
in the single known <I>PP1a</I> gene of <I>Arabidopsis</I>. Further analysis
of this mutant is in progress.

<P>Finally, I reported on a sucrose transporter that is essential for long-distance
sugar transport and is located together with its mRNA in enucleate sieve
elements. These data indicate that plant proteins can traffic between cells
by receptor-mediated processes. Although these results were not obtained
in <I>Arabidopsis</I> our current research is addressing the problem of
protein trafficking between cells in the model species <I>Arabidopsis</I>.
It will be interesting to learn whether the cytoskeleton also plays a role
in the transport of endogenous mRNAs and proteins within or between cells.

<P>In summary, the increasing knowledge from genome projects together with
gene expression data, mutant analyses and cell-biological tools all combine
to open up new research perspectives and underline the outstanding scientific
potential of <I>Arabidopsis</I>.
