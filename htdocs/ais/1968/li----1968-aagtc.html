Several years ago a program to isolate nutritional mutants was started
in our laboratory.  Initially the progenies of single seeds exposed to
mutagen were handled individually. By this method in approximately six
thousand progenies of X-ray treated seeds 5 thiamine auxotrophs could
be obtained.  Similarly handled populations of over 2,000 plants
obtained after ethylemethane sulfonate treatments of the seed yielded
6 thiamine deficient mutants.  Obviously this method is too laborious
for the isolation of a larger number of mutations at specific loci.<p>

The following modifications have since been introduced.  Instead of
placing with forceps only five mutagen treated seeds per five-inch
diameter pots, 50 seeds were planted to the same.  The treated seeds
were suspended in 0. 12% agar in a concentration of 2.5 seeds per ml.
This free-flowing liquid was supplied dropwise to the surface of the
soil or distributed as a very fine continuous flow from a separatory
funnel.  20,000 or more seeds can be planted in good distribution
within an hour with some experience. The germination and growth of a
material planted in this manner is entirely satisfactory.  In one
experiment 47,415 seed bearing plants were obtained from 88,235 seeds
treated with 12,000 R X-rays after 24 hours presoaking. Another
similar seed population exposed to 0.24% ethyl methane sulfonate
produced 48% survivors.<p>

The plants grown in the same pot were harvested in bulk by threshing
the seed on a sheet of paper.  Approximately 300-400 seeds from each
bulk progeny were then broadcast on the surface of soil in five-inch
pots again.  The mutants were scored several times during the first
three weeks after germination. Since the great majority of the
thiamine auxotrophs display a normal or nearly normal transmission,
the statistical probability assures us of about 80% recovery of all
the thiamine mutants induced.  Most of those that remain undetected
are not very useful for genetic studies because of the poor
penetrance. This new isolation procedure required only about 1/10 the
space and labor relative to the old technique.<p>

The nutritional mutants are first selected in the second generation
after the treatment in soil cultures.  A "complete medium" containing
vitamins, amino acids, nucleic acid precursors is applied to the
nongrowing or poorly developing seedlings after gemination. The exact
requirement, if any, is verified later in aseptic agar cultures.<p>

To be sure that all new isolates are really new occurrences rather
than mechanical seed contaminations from previous experiments,
genetically marked different stocks of Columbia wild type background
were used for each experiment.<p>

So far 62 independent thiamine auxotrophs have been analyzed in our
laboratory. From these 40 (64.5%) require only the pyrimidine moiety;
9 (14.5%) respond to "vitamin thiazole"; 13 (21%) grow only with
intact thiamine.<p>
