POSTDOCTORAL POSITIONS:
STRESS PERCEPTION/SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION AND CELL WALLS

Laboratory of Janet Braam
Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology
Rice University


Postdoctoral positions are available to participate in research  focused on determining the mechanisms 
by which plants sense  environmental stresses, transduce signals into cells and regulate  cellular and 
organismal alterations.  Using transgenic Arabidopsis  expressing a reporter under the control of the 
mechanosensitive TCH   regulatory region, we have isolated mutants with the goal to identify  essential 
components responsible for perception and response to  diverse environmental stresses.  In addition, 
we are taking an  integrative approach to elucidate the physiological and cellular  functions of the 
xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase (XTH) gene  family of Arabidopsis. XTHs are capable of 
modifying a major  component of the wall and yet the physiological functions of these  enzymes are 
not well understood.  See: http://www.bioc.rice.edu/ ~braam/projects/index.html for more information.

A strong background in plant biology, molecular biology, biochemistry  and genetics is required.  
Only highly motivated individuals with  proven track records should apply.  Applicants should send 
a  curriculum vitae, a cover letter describing research experience and  interests, and the names 
and email addresses for at least three  references to:  braam@rice.edu.
