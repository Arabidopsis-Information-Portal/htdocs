<H1>Session 6: Reproduction II</H1>
<H4>Chair: E. Meyerowitz, Caltech, Pasedena, USA</H4>

The first speaker was <A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Norwich/sessions/S52.html" target="_top">Marty Yanofsky</A> (U.C. San Diego), who spoke about <I>AP1</I>, <I>CAL</I> and <I>LFY</I>, and about new data on the <I>AGL</I> MADS box genes.  Among the many new data, he pointed out that the initial expression of <I>AP1</I> is delayed in <I>lfy</I> mutants, indicating that some <I>AP1</I> activities are downstream of <I>LFY</I>. This is consistent with the <I>p35S-LFY</I> phenotype being attenuated in <I>ap1</I> mutants, but the <I>p35S-AP1</I> phenotype not being attenuated in <I>LFY</I> mutants. Yeast 2-hybrid screens to identify <I>CAL</I> and <I>AP1</I> interacting proteins found <I>AGL9</I>, <I>20</I>, <I>22</I> and <I>24</I>; the expression of all of them overlaps that of <I>AP1</I> and <I>CAL</I>.  Yanofsky also discussed <I>AGL5</I>, with carpel-specific expression that requires upstream AG activity.  <I>p35S-AGL5</I> was shown to rescue carpel development in <I>ag</I> mutants, resulting in female fertility; in addition, petals are partially converted to stamens in the transgenic plants.  <I>AGL5</I> can thus act as a C function organ identity gene.
<p>
I spoke next (<A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Norwich/sessions/S53.html" target="_top">E. Meyerowitz</A>, Caltech), and described three different modes of control of the pattern of cell division in developing flowers. One is mediated by the <I>SUP</I> zinc-finger gene, which seems to act in the third whorl to repress cell divisions, and nonautonomously act in the fourth whorl to increase cell division.  <I>sup</I> mutants thus have extra stamens, and a reduced fourth whorl.  The second is mediated by <I>CLAVATA1</I>, <I>CLAVATA3</I> and interacting genes such as <I>SHOOT MERISTEMLESS</I>. This is control of the overall number of cell divisions in floral meristems.  <I>CLV1</I> and <I>CLV3</I> act to repress cell division, their mutants have extra cells and extra floral organs.  The molecular cloning of <I>CLV1</I> shows it to be a leucine-rich-repeat transmembrane receptor kinase.  The third mode of cell division control is on the spacing of cell divisions during floral organ formation.  the <I>PERIANTHIA</I> gene regulates this; recessive mutants in <I>PAN</I> cause closer spacing of organs, and thus extra floral organs.  <I>PAN</I> codes for a basic-leucine zipper protein. 
<p>      
<A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Norwich/sessions/S54.html" target="_top">Justin Goodrich</A> (Univ. of Edinburgh) followed, and described the <I>CURLY LEAF</I> gene.  <I>clf</I> mutants have curled leaves, carpelloid sepals and staminoid petals; all as a result of ectopic expression of <I>AG</I>.  The gene codes for a plant homologue of the <I>Drosophila</I> Enhancer of Zeste protein, a member of the Polycomb group of proteins that act in flies to maintain repression of homeotic selector genes.  The plant homologue seems to have a similar function, despite the fly homeotic genes being homeobox proteins, while the plant ones are MADS box proteins. 
<p>      
George Haughn (U. British Columbia) spoke about the cloning of <I>UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS</I>, a gene affecting floral meristem identity, floral organ formation, and organ identity.  <I>UFO</I> codes for the <I>Arabidopsis</I> homologue of the <I>Antirrhinum</I> <I>FIMBRIATA</I> gene.  A yeast 2-hybrid screen with <I>UFO</I> as bait gave a gene called <I>UIP1</I>, which codes for a plant protein related to mammalian <I>p19</I>, involved in cell cycle control.  <I>In situ</I> hybridization showed <I>UIP1</I> to be 
expressed in dividing cells, a domain that overlaps with that of <I>UFO</I> 
expression.  <I>UFO</I> also shows some similarity to the mammalian <I>p45</I> protein in a 45 amino acid stretch; <I>p45</I> interacts with <I>p19</I>.  The <I>UFO</I> phenotype may therefore result from loss of cell division in part of the developing flower. A model in which <I>SUP</I> (see above), <I>UFO</I> and <I>LEUNIG</I> all control different aspects of cell division in flowers was presented.

<A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Norwich/sessions/S55.html" target="_top">Bob Elliot</A> (Monash Univ., Melbourne) spoke about the <I>AINTEGUMENTA</I> gene. Mutants give reduced floral organ number, reduced integument growth, and abnormal embryo sac development.  <I>ANT</I> was cloned and shown to be a member of the <I>AP2</I> family of DNA binding proteins, with two <I>AP2</I> domains.  The gene is expressed in floral organ primordia, cotyledon primordia, leaf primordia (though cotyledons and leaves are normal in ant mutants), and in developing carpels and ovules.  Mosaic analysis shows that <I>ANT</I> in the L1 layer appears to act to normalize development of the L2-derived embryo sac. 
<p>
<A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Norwich/sessions/S56.html" target="_top">David Twell</A> (Univ. Leicester) discussed asymmetric cell divisions in 
male gametophyte development, by which the pollen mother cell divides unequally to give a large vegetative cell and a small generative cell. Using colchicine to make this division symmetric in cultured microspores prevents inactivation of a generative cell-specific promoter in the vegetative cell, showing that the asymmetry is causal in the functional differences shown by the two cell types.  A screen in <I>Arabidopsis</I> for pollen mitosis I cell division mutants was described, with several promising classes of mutations resulting.
<p>
<A HREF="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/Norwich/sessions/S57.html" target="_top">Luo Ming</A> (CSIRO, Canberra) described mutations that allow seed
development without prior fertilization (<I>FIS</I>, fertilization independent seeds).  The mutant screen was to start with self-sterile <I>pistillata</I> homozygotes, and to look for mutant progeny that had some degree of silique elongation.  Several different loci (<I>fis1</I>, <I>fis2</I> and <I>fis3</I>, on chromosomes 1, 2 and 3, respectively) were identified.  Unfertilized <I>fis</I> mutant seeds have deformed embryo-like structures and form endosperm.  The mutations are embryo lethals even when fertilized, and at least one of them is a gametophyte-effect mutant.
