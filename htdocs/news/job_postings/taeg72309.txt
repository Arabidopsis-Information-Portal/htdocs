Hyung-Taeg Cho’s Lab

Two post-doctoral positions in Hyung-Taeg Cho’s Lab in the Department of Biological Sciences 
at Seoul National University are available for highly motivated biologists who have interest in the 
topics of (1) evolution of auxin-transporting proteins (PINs), and (2) mechanism of root hair 
morphogenesis. The appointee for topic (1) will be studying on evolutionary aspects of 
molecular structure and function of PIN family members, and is desirable to be familiar with 
biochemical tools such as diverse protein tools and immuno-precipitation. The appointee for 
topic (2) will be studying on the molecular mechanism of novel root hair-specific genes, which 
we recently have identified (Plant Physiol 150, 1459-1473), during root hair morphogenesis. The 
appointee (2) will also identify the target genes for major root hair-morphogenetic transcription 
factors, and thus is desirable to be able to use yeast two-hybrid technology and chromatin 
immune-precipitation (Chip) assay. For our recent work, see the publication list in our 
homepage as linked below.

Candidates should have a PhD and experiences in plant molecular biology, gene cloning, and 
analyses of transgenic plants in addition to the skills described above. Reasonable levels of 
writing and verbal communicating skills (in English) are required. Successful applicants will be 
capable of independent thought and designing experiments. Because our research is oriented 
very basic in plant biology fields, a self-motivation and creative thought are highly required.

The appointee will lead a small group of graduates.
The salary will be between 1,800,000 ~ 2,500,000 Korean Won per month depending on 
experience.

The positions can start as early as from September 2009, but also available later on. 
Applications are desirable to arrive by August 31, 2009.
