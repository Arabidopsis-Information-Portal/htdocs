Genome Reannotation Plan, as of March 2001.

TIGR:
1. Make a non-redundant chromosome sequence from BAC clone sequences.

2. Annotate each BAC sequence using TIGR's annotation scheme with the
latest sequence information in GenBank (i.e. ESTs, full-length CDSes,
Protein sequences). Update both the gene models and annotation calls.

3. If new or change of chromosome loci (i.e. standard ORF names such
as AT2G3340), communicate with MIPS and TAIR on these names.

4. Provide the genome annotation data from their ATH1 database in
searchable format via the web.

5. Provide the BAC annoation data and Chromosome scaffold data of BAC
tiling paths in their public FTP directory, with regular updates once
a week.

6. Sumbit TIGR's BAC sequences to NCBI's Nucleotide database.

TAIR:
1. Import TIGR's genome annotation data into TAIR database.

2. Import BAC annotations from GenBank into TAIR database.

3. Provide the genome annotation data from the TAIR database in
searchable format.

4. Annotate gene models with information from TIGR and GenBank,
in-house sequence analysis and from the literature and develop a TAIR
gene model.

5. Communicate with TIGR and MIPS if new or changed chromsome loci are
identified.

6. Annotate genome with genetic markers, polymorphisms, and insertion
sites.

7. Group all the gene models for each Locus.

8. Provide Locus data searchable from TAIR database, GO database, and
Entrez's LinkOut.

9. Provide the genome annotation data to NCBI's Genome Database.

MIPS:
1. Reannotate using MIPS' Pedant software.

2. Communicate with TIGR and TAIR if new or changed chromsome loci are
identified.

3. Provide genome annotation data searchable from MATDB and
downloadable from public FTP site.

4. Submit the reannotated BAC sequences from ESSA and CSHL to EMBL.
