Growth substances are known to have variant effects in plants. They
control division, tension and the differentiation of cells, influence
the main vital processes: respiration, photosynthesis, root
nourishment, growth and so on (Polevoy, 1982).<p>

For studying the regulatory activity of phytohormones it is very
important to know the change of their content and form of existance in
cells during the plant ontogenesis. Mutants are convenient objects of
investigation in this respect. Their study opens the way to
investigate the regulation of the intensity of the processes at the
gene level. In this connection the aim of our paper is to determine
the cytokinine activity of leaves in the original and mutant forms of
plants at different periods of their development.<p>

Arabidopsis thaliana, race Enkheim and its mutant 58/15 taken from the
collection of the Department of General Genetics of Cotton (Academy of
Sciences of the Tajik SSR, Dushanbe, USSR) were used.<p>

Mutant 58/15 was obtained by the treatment of original seeds with
ethylmethanesulphonate. In contrast to the original form, the colour
of leaves of mutant 58/15 varies from light green to yellow, depending
on the illumination conditions. The rosette is average, the height of
the plant is 12-16 cm, the leaves are small and oblong and packed in
the rosette as original form (Yakubowa et al., 1980).<p>

To isolate the endogenic cytokines from the leaves of the plants
studied the method described in the paper of Masin et al. (1978) was
used. The cytokinine activity was determined by the biotest based on e
cytokinine stimulation of chlorophyll formation in cucumber cotyledons
(Fletcher et al., 1971; Nicolayeva, 1979). In our tests, cotyledons of
a cucumber cultivar "Concurent" were used. The determination of the
cytokinine activity in the leaves of Arabidopsis, race Enkheim and its
mutant 58/15 was held during the phases of rosettes and budding.
Aqueious and etheric fractions of wet cytokinine extracts were
examined. The results are shown in Figures 1 and 2.<p>

In the leaves of Arabidopsis, race Enkheim, in the phase of rosettes
on the chromatogram of the etheric fraction the highest cytokinine
activity is observed in the zone cRf .4 - 5; in the aqueous fraction
it is observed in the zone cRf .8 - .9 (Figure 1). In the phase of
budding wet extracts of Arabidopsis leaves, race Enkheim, on the
chromatogram show zones with higher cytokinine activity than that in
the phase of vegetation (Figure 1). In both aqueous and etheric
fractions of ethanol extracts of Arabidopsis leaves, race Enkheim,
centrifuges in the acid system of dissolvents (Figure 1), the
substances inhibiting hte biotest were found (zones cRf .4 -b, cRf .1
- 1 is the etheric fraction; zones cRf .6 - 7, cRf .8 - .9 is the
aqueous fraction).<p>

Our data on the increase of the cytokinine activity in the leaves of
Arabidopsis, race Enkheim, in the phase of budding coincide with the
data of other authors. Donchev (1960) studying the change of the
activity of the endogenic cytokinines in the stems and leaves of a
tomato plant during their vegetation found that the increase of the
content of free cytokinine forms is seen during the phases of budding
and mass flowering. The author concludes that the flowering of plants
is connected with the high level of phytohormones.<p>

The results of the study of cytokine activity of mutant 58/15 leaves
show another picture (Figure 2). The highest cytokinine activity of
both etheric and aqueous fractions of ethanol extracts from the
chlorophyll mutant 58/15 leaves is observed in the rosette phase. In
the phase of budding the cytokinine activity of mutant leaf extracts
noticeable decreases. It is possibly connected with the shortened
vegetation period of mutant 58/15, and the lowering of the cytokinine
activity level leads to the more rapid aging of plants. Apparently the
mutation in this object of study affected the gene responsible for the
synthesis of the phytohormones.<p>

b - aqueous fraction.<p>

According to the data of Van Staden et al. (1973) the group of
combinations on the chromatogram in zone cRf .1 - .5 represents
immobile combined cytokinine forms, and in zone cRf .5 - 1.0 mobile
free forms are seen. The results of our study showed that there were
groups of combinations represented by both immobile and mobile
cytokinine forms in the leaves of Arabidopsis, race Enkheim and its
mutant 58/15. In our tests a small prevalence of immobile combined
cytokinine forms were observed (Figure 1 and 2).<p>

Thus we can conclude that the cytokinine activity of the plant leaves
studied changes depending on the phase of plant development. In the
leaves of Arabidopsis, race Enkheim, the increase of cytokinine
activity corelates with the beginning of flowering.<p>

The cytokinine activity of the leaves of mutant 58/15 differs from
that of the original form, which is possibly due to the mutation
afecting the hormonal regulation of metabolic processes.<p>
