TWO SYNERGY LECTURESHIPS IN MICROBIAL AND PLANT SCIENCE 
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA AND JOHN INNES CENTRE
Ref: ATR920  
 
£37,839 to £43,840 per annum 
 
Two new academic appointments have been created to develop joint research 
programmes between the John Innes Centre (JIC) and the School of 
Biological Sciences (BIO), offering exciting opportunities for collaborative 
multi-disciplinary research. Both positions will be employed by the UEA and 
located at the JIC and are available immediately on an indefinite basis. 
 
We seek outstanding candidates who can interface with plant scientists and 
microbiologists at JIC and BIO. We welcome, for example, microbiologists 
with interests in community or systems microbiology that relate to plant-soil 
interactions and soil productivity or those who employ innovative approaches 
to discover and understand the biosynthesis and function of natural 
products/bioactives, particularly those made in Actinomycetes. 
 
All applications will be considered, but the posts will ideally suit scientists at 
an early stage of their independent research careers. Appointments will be 
based upon a track record of scientific excellence and future research vision. 
Appointees will have an attractive start-up package and technical support. 
You must have a PhD or equivalent qualification and be able to fulfil all 
essential elements of the person specification. 
 
Closing date: 12 noon on 20 October 2010.
