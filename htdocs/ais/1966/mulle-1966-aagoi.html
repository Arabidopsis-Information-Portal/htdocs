	I.  In connection with the finding that after treatment of seeds with EMS or nitro-samides the frequency of recessive lethals increases exponentially (n~2) with the dose
(MULLER, 1966), it was interesting to study the dose-response-relationship in the case of X-rays.  Seeds of Arabidopsis soaked in distilled water for 18 h were irradiated with X-rays (180 kv, dose rate:  410 R/min).  Degree of sterility (s) and frequency of recessive lethals were determined by the embryo test.  (For root length reduction induced by X-rays cf. MULLER, 1964).<p>

The results show that the relationship between dose and frequency of M2 mutants (mc) is approximately linear.<p>

	II.  In another experiment "dry" seeds were irradiated with 8 kR and 72 kR and hydrated in the presence of 02 and N2.  The water content of the seeds was stabilized prior to irradiation by storing them for 4 days at room temperature in desiccators over dry CaC12 (~6%), saturated CaC12 (~9%), saturated NaC103 (~16%) on water (~22%).  The frequency of recessive lethals was determined by the embryo test.  (5 pods per M1-plant were scored).<p>
