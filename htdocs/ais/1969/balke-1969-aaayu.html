<h2> EMS treatment of plants</h2><p>

It is possible to treat young plants (3 to 12 days old) with EMS.  The
leaves are very sensitive to the EMS (probably on account of the low
pH)*.  The best results are obtained by treating the roots and
avoiding contact with the leaves. Even then a long treatment damages
the plants and a short severe treatment (240 mM 1 hr, or 480 mM 1/2
hr, unbuffered EMS) was found preferable.<p>

*(Addition of the Editor: EMS gives aqueous solutions with a pH of 7,
if the substance is undecayed and the solution is fresh.  Because of
their high toxicity, low pH solutions of EMS have a drastically
decreased mutagenic effectiveness, which can be improved only
partially by buffering. Cf.: C.F. KONZAK et al., in "Induction of
Mutations and the Mutation Process".  pp 123-132.  Czech. Acad. Sci.
Publ. Praha 1965)<p>

By treating the upright plants on the medium on which they are growing
(filter paper or agar), the solution can be spread over the medium to
reach the roots without touching the leaves.  After the treatment the
plants must be transplanted to a fresh medium.  Plants on filter paper
can be "washed" on the paper (to remove the EMS) before transplanting.
On agar the EMS may be replaced by water, but, as some will have
diffused into the agar, the plants must be transplanted as soon as
possible. When transplanting no EMS-contaminated medium may be
included. Some root damage is thus sure to occur.  By transplanting
into perlite the plants recover quickly, even after complete removal
of the roots. The plants can then be transferred, with a clump of
perlite, to soil.  They can be scored in the usual way.<p>

Similar treatments gave good survival and mutant frequencies for
chlorophylls, of 2% to 6% (embryo test for 2 consecutive fruits).<p>
