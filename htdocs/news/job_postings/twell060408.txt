THE EPIGENETIC CONTROL OF PLANT MALE GAMETOPHYTE AND 
GERMLINE DEVELOPMENT

Salary Grade 7 - £29,138 to £33,780 per annum

Applications are invited for a 3-year BBSRC-funded postdoctoral position to
investigate the role and diversity of small RNA (sRNA) pathways that operate
in the epigenetic control of gene expression during male gametophyte and
male germline development. The project forms part of a collaboration with
the University of Oxford (Prof. Hugh Dickinson) and offers the opportunity
to join a leading research group working on the mechanisms regulating cell
division and cell fate determination during male reproductive development in
Arabidopsis.

Applicants should have a PhD in molecular genetics, biochemistry or a
related discipline. Experience in molecular techniques, bioinformatics and
cell imaging would be of particular value.
