*  Within the Arabidopsis programme many labs are penetrating the 
secrets of plant growth and development.  The concentration of effort 
into one organism has seemingly obvious advantages, but for those 
advantages to be manifest in reality communication between the groups 
needs to be good.  One of the crucial variants between labs relates to 
the growth of plant material.  Even if everyone followed the same recipe 
(which they don't!) the variation in facilities available inevitably results in 
different environmental conditions and therefore different development 
rates.  (N.B. for non-plant physiologists: plant development is not regular 
with time, nor tightly linked to growth, environmental factors determine 
rate of development with temperature being of overriding importance.)
This needn't matter! - if everyone communicates information about their 
plants in the same language.  Vague descriptors such as "plants were 
sampled in the vegetative phase" or "leaves were taken from plants 10 
days after germination" are at best inadequate, at worst misleading.  This 
is where developmental keys come in.
Developmental keys were first used in agricultural circles to standardise 
the language used to describe the common crops by those in the seed 
and agrochemical industries, both traders and researchers.  The keys 
use a simple numerical code to correspond precisely to worded 
descriptions of development.  An example of their use in crop 
production is found in the specifications for agrochemical use where 
frequently a herbicide, say, has a narrow window of safe application to 
the crop relating solely to stage of development and not to time of year, 
or age of crop.  The use of calendar date in recommendations would 
result in frequent disaster.  The use of keys is now widespread for the 
major crops because the benefits of a simple, precise, commonly 
understood language which expresses an important reality are 
appreciated by the crop production industry.
A key for Arabidopsis should take into account the following:
 *  Must be useful for all workers whatever their stage of interest, should 
give equal detail for each major developmental stage.
 *  Should easily be accommodated by computer data handling systems. 
 *  Developmental stages are not always sequential, e.g., flower 
development does not necessarily wait for leaf development to be 
complete, seed development can be contiguous with flower 
development within the same plant.
 *  Other existing keys are decimalised.
 *  Should incorporate flexibility for dealing with non-conformist plants 
and as yet undiscovered mutants.
 *  Must accommodate the open-flowering character of Arabidopsis, and 
the somewhat complicated relationship between the main and 
secondary racemes (flowering stems).
 *  Must use straightforward descriptors appropriate for everyone.
 *  Must be adequately tested in a range of situations before publication.
Test the key out on your pet system.  Let me know if its workable for you, 
if it misses out crucial stages, or includes non-existent stages, or any 
other comments.
