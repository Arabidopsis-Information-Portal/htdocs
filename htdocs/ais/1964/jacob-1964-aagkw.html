Vol 01:<h2>JACOBS, M.</h2><h2>On the induction of biochemical mutants</h2>

Biochemical mutants have been obtained by means of sterile culture of
M2's after mutagenic treatment.  The special requirements (amino
acids, vitamins, purins and pyrimidines) are being individually
established.  Mutants resistant to copper have also been found; the
test for the genetical basis of resistance shows a single gene
dependence.  Moreover mutants for resistance to DDT have been selected
after spraying or dipping the young plants in a 1:500 solution of the
commercial product.<p>
