Vol 01:<h2>ROBBELEN, G.</h2><h2>A gene induced plastom mutant</h2>

The plastom has been defined by RENNER as the sum of the
extrachromosomal autonomous heritable elements within the plastid.  In
Arabidopsis, just as has been found for some other plants, plastom
mutations can be induced by a nuclear gene in its homozygous recessive
condition.  Such a mutant that has been termed albomaculata (am) arose
as a segregant in a second generation after X-irradiation of mature
pollen grains with 32 kr, giving a ratio of 96 variegated plants to
312 green ones.  According to expectation about 60% of the latter
green again segregated in the following generation after natural
selfing, giving the same ratio of 3:1.  The offspring of the
variegated mutants without exception was variegated again, the portion
of the white leaf area, however, in these mutant descendants was
enlarged significantly, sometimes up to that extent, that entirely
white seedlings were formed.  These did never occur in the segregating
progeny of a heterozygous green plant; here the homozygous recessive
individuals did not show that albomaculatio  until the later stages of plant
development.<p>

The second observation, pointing towards the possibility of an
extrachromosomal, plastomatic factor involved in this variegation,
was, that its pattern within a leaf is strictly correlated to the
margin of a cell descendence.  Out of entirely white cells in the
course of leaf development only white ones originate.  Within these
cells after staining with Rhodamin B in the light microscope nothing
but these faintly coloured, vesicle like plastids were found without
any inner differentiation.  At the border between white and green leaf
sectors, however, mixed cells were frequently seen with these small
mutated plastids and the larger normal chloroplasts side by side.  The
same clear-cut difference between both plastid types could be
demonstrated in electro microscope pictures, where normal, mutated as
well as both plastid types jointly could be traced in one cell.  No
intermediates between both types occurred.<p>

The third evidence has been worked out in hybridization experiments,
proving that this chloroplast mutation is independent of the genom,
after it once has been induced in one plastid by the mentioned
recessive nuclear gene.  Crossing the mutant reciprocally with the
normal basic variety Enkheim (En), the status albomaculatus is
inherited to the heterozygous hybrid strictly maternally.  No
variegation occurs with the mutant as pollen parent.  The following
hybridization succession was done in order to establish whether or not
the mutated status of the plastids may be maintained for several
generations irrespective of the nuclear constitution. The variegated
mutant with green and white plastids and the gene am in a homozygous
recessive condition has been crossed as a female with a normal "En"
plant. The heterozygous F1 gives lethal white, green and variegated
plants, that depends on the composition of the zygote.  After crossing
to normal, heterozygous and dominant homozygous appear 1:1.  That
means that likewise 50% of the variegated plants should carry the
homozygous dominant allel of am, i.e., am+.  To show this, a random
sample of these variegated plants is used as pollen parents in
crossing with normal plants.  According to the expectation, this F1 is
green.  On the one side about 50% of these individuals, that is to say
the heterozygous ones, give raise to segregating F2-offsprings, whreas
on the other side really no albomaculation appeared.  The selfed
progenies of the latter am+ am+ parent plants then were followed for
four generations up to now.  And though apparently no new plastom
mutation had been induced because of the normal dominant nuclear
constitution, the variegation could be maintained unchanged.<p>
