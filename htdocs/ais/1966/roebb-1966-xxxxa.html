	The editor would be highly pleased to have in the next issue of AIS under this heading contributions and discussions on the problem of how to coordinate the gene nomenclature as well as the maintenance of natural and mutant stocks of Arabidopsis.  Some proposals have already been put forward during the Symposium in Gottingen, April 1965.  There is urgent need to look for cooperators<p>

	1.  who propagate natural races with avoidance of any severe selection pressure,<p>

	2.  who maintain and compare selected lines from natural races, mainly those which are commonly used for experimental designs,<p>

	3.  who hold mutant stocks for comparison with newly described types in order to coordinate naming and<p>

	4.  who are engaged with gene mapping, e.g., of only one linkage group each.<p>

	Applications are requested to be sent to the editor as soon as possible!<p>
