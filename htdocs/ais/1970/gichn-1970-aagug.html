In the paper of GICHNER and VELEMINSKY (1967) the mutagenic activity
of different N-alkylnitrosoureas was compared. The tested compounds
differed in their alkyl groups (methyl, ethyl etc.) whereas their acyl
group was the same.  An increasing number of C-atoms in the alkyl
group caused - with certain exceptions - a decrase in the mutagenic
effectiveness, whereas the mtuagenic efficiency was approximately the
same.  It seemed, therefore, to be interesting to compare the
mutagenic effectivness and the efficiency of nitroso compounds, having
the same alkylnitroso group, but diffeering in the group bound on the
acyl moiety. For this purpose 3 compounds were chosen:
N-methyl-N-nitroso-urea (MNH), N,N'-dimethyl-N-nitrosourea (DMNH) and
N,N',N'-trimethyl-nitrosourea (TMNH).  All three compounds are strong
cancerogens in rats (DRUCKREY et al., 1967).  The chosen nitrosoureas
differ in their hydrolysis rates, especially in neutral and in
alkaline solutions.  MNH is the most unstable compound, TMNH the most
stable one.<p>

Table : Mutagenic efficiency and mutagenic effectiveness of MNH, DMNH,
and TMNH<p>

All three compounds are strong mutagens for Arabidopsis thaliana.  The
mutagenic effectiveness, expressed by the concentration in MM, needed
to induce 50% segregating M1-siliquae differed significantly (Table).
With the increasing number of methyls, bound to the NH2 group, the
effectiveness decreased.  Of several possible explanations for these
differences, the different stabiities of the tested compound seems to
be the most plausible.  The mutagenic efficiency of the tested
compounds, expressed by the degree of sterility accompanying 50%
segregating M1 siliquae, did not significantly differ (Table).<p>
