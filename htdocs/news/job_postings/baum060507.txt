Post-doc in Plant Evolutionary Developmental Genetics

I am looking for a post-doc to join my lab for 2-3 years to conduct research on 
the genetic basis of morphological evolution in Brassicaceae, focusing on the 
role of meristem identity genes in the evolution of rosette-flowering in 
Leavenworthia.  Two specific projects need finishing and writing-up, but 
thereafter the direction of the project is somewhat flexible.  The ideal 
candidate would be somebody who has studied Arabidopsis developmental genetics, 
is comfortable with molecular biological methods, and is interested in applying 
those skills to study the evolution of morphological and ecological diversity.  
The position is available July 1 or thereafter.

To apply please send a CV and the names of references to:
