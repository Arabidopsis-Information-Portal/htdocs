A postdoctoral position is available in Karel Riha’s group at the Gregor Mendel Institute 
of Molecular Plant Biology in Vienna, Austria (www.gmi.oeaw.ac.at). The Gregor 
Mendel Institute is a newly founded research facility of the Austrian Academy of 
Sciences that is integrated in the international and highly prolific scientific environment 
of the Vienna Biocenter. 

The lab is primary interested in understanding the structure, function and replication of 
telomeres. We are looking for a highly motivated scientist, preferably with a background 
in biochemistry or chromatin analysis, to undertake a project focused on functional 
analysis of telomeric chromatin. 

Interested candidates should forward their application including a cover letter, CV and 
contact information for at least two referees to Dr. Karel Riha: karel.riha@gmi.oeaw.ac.at
