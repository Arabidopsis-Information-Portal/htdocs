<h2>Genetic and ontogenetic correlations between leaf pigment and assimilation efficiency in mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana</h2><p>

	Last year HOFFMAN (1965) published preliminary results on chlorophyll formation and photosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana race En-1 under continuous light (300 ftc.).  His experiments represented no direct dependence of CO2 assimilation on total chlorophyll content.  The pigment was in excess in relation to photosynthetic intensity. But this statement was only valid for the final ontogenetic stages (ripening husks, rosette leaves dead).  At that time there were no special studies about the genetic variation of this possible physiological correlation in Arabidopsis.  The older experiments of ROBBELEN (1957) showed that there was no significant interaction between chlorophyll reduction and growth in Arabidopsis mutants containing more pigment than 35% of the normal type.  With other plants similar results were obtained (GOTTSCHALK and MULLER, 1964).<p>

	At present there is no exact and overall accepted method for separating the amount of photosynthesis from respiration in light.  For that reason we applied methods introduced in plant ecology by WALTER (1948).  We have defined the assimilation efficiency as the mean increase in dry weight or calory yield per day and plant (KRANZ, 1966).<p>

	Studying the leaf pigments, chlorophyll a and b, and the carotenoids in various leaf colour mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) HEYNH. we have confirmed the significant differences in quantity and quality compared with the standarad line En-2 at all ontogenetic stages of development. There is four times more pigment in the tetraploid line En-4n than in the gene mutants ch1, ch2 and V81.  In ch1 no chlorophyll b and in ch2 a reduced content of b can be measured (HIRONO and REDEI, 1963).  In V 81 (= ch3, see VELEMINSKY and ROBBELEN, 1966) a relative high amount of carotenoids is found.  Flowering plants yield the highest chlorophyll a content per leaf area.<p>

	On constant conditions in temperature (20 =/- 1*degree*C), humidity (65 =/- 3 p.c.) and light (24 hrs, 490 ftc) our experiments result in positive ontogenetic correlations between chlorophyll a content and dry weight increase during the phases of leaf formation and flowering time (see Figure 1, solid lines).  Later on, the pigment quantity decreases whereas the assimilation efficiency increases (see V 167 and En-2).<p>

	The genetic correlation of these physiological correlated characters in the tested material seems to be curvilinear; e.g. during the early phase of leaf formation (see densely broken line) there is a lower assimilation efficiency per unit of chlorophyll a than in the following flowering time (see sparsely broken line above).  The curvatures of the genetic correlations differ with the ontogenetic stages.  These preliminary results demonstrate that the genotypes of the tested Arabidopsis material are fitted to a positive physiological correlation between chlorophyll content and assimilation efficiency.<p>
