Recent advances in gene isolation, mutant identification, and technology
development were highlighted in the session on embryo development. Diane
Shevell (Rockefeller University) summarized her work on molecular
characterization of EMB30 (GNOM). Surprisingly, this gene is expressed
throughout development and encodes a protein with regions of sequence
similarity to a yeast protein (Sec7) associated with the Golgi apparatus. EMB30
therefore appears to play an important but general role in cell division and
cell expansion throughout the life cycle. Whether it also plays a more direct
role in the regulation of embryonic pattern formation remains to be determined. <P>

Brian Schwartz (Oklahoma State University) described recent advances in the
analysis of a class of embryo-defective mutants known as suspensor
transformation (sus) mutants in which cells of the suspensor acquire
characteristics normally restricted to the embryo proper. A T-DNA tagged allele
of sus2 was used to recover flanking plant sequences and clone the
corresponding wild-type gene. Sequence analysis revealed a striking similarity
with the yeast PRP8 gene that encodes an essential protein component of the
spliceosome. Mutants altered in PRP8 have not previously been described in a
multicellular eukaryote. Molecular characterization of SUS2 should therefore
provide a unique opportunity to dissect RNA processing in plants from a genetic
perspective. The mutant phenotype is also consistent with existing models of
developmental interactions between the embryo proper and suspensor. <P>

Marilyn West (University of California) described the results of projects in
three different laboratories associated with the Embryos for the 21st Century
group. The first project (Harada lab) involved genetic and phenotypic
characterization a T-DNA tagged allele of the lec1 mutant, described previously
in the Meinke laboratory, that exhibits many interesting defects in embryonic
maturation. One surprising observation was the discovery of twin embryos in
double mutants involving lec1-2 and fus3. The second project (Goldberg lab)
used in situ hybridization studies to provide evidence for the existence of
regional domains within the globular embryo before other signs of apical-basal
differentiation. The final project (Fischer lab) described a fascinating new
class of mutants, similar to those described later in the session by Abed
Chaudhury, in which seed development proceeds to a limited extent in the
absence of fertilization. These results provided further evidence that dramatic
new insights into the regulation of plant embryogenesis may be obtained even
before the start of the 21st century. <P>

Four poster talks were also included in this session. Ryuji Tsugeki (Carnegie
Institution, Baltimore) described the isolation and characterization of a
tagged embryo-defective mutant that contained a Ds element inserted into a
ribosomal protein gene. The sequence of the gene product was most closely
related to the nuclear-encoded S16 ribosomal protein localized in mitochondria
of Neurospora. This work provided another example of what types of genes are
likely to be disrupted in embryo-defective mutants, but even more importantly
illustrated how rapidly sequence information can be obtained from Ds insertion
lines using direct sequencing of TAIL-PCR products. <P>

Wolfgang Lukowitz (Tubingen, Germany) presented the results of chromosome
walking to the KNOLLE gene required for normal radial patterning in the
developing embryo. KNOLLE encodes a protein 310 amino acids in length with
similarity to vesicle docking proteins of the syntaxin family described in
animal systems. KNOLLE function may be limited to specific stages of the cell
cycle because transcripts are present only in isolated patches of cells in the
developing embryo. The availability of multiple mutant alleles should
facilitate further analysis of this interesting gene. <P>

Abed Chaudhury (CSIRO, Australia) described the isolation and characterization
of a fascinating collection of mutants that exhibit fertilization-independent
seed development. These fis mutants were isolated as EMS-induced
pseudorevertants of the mutant pistillata based on their ability to produce
long siliques in the absence of stamens. At least three different loci have
been identified and mapped. Seed enlargement and a limited amount of endosperm
development were observed in the absence of fertilization. Embryo development
arrested at the torpedo stage when heterozygous plants were pollinated. Further
analysis of these mutants may provide valuable insights into the regulation of
early stages of embryo and endosperm development. <P>

Patrick Gallois (Perpignan, France) concluded the session by describing how a
promoter trapping experiment designed to generate information on promoters
active during embryogenesis resulted in the molecular isolation of an
intriguing regulatory sequence that appears to drive GUS expression only in
cells of the suspensor. This promoter may be particularly valuable in future
experiments designed to investigate developmental interactions between the
embryo proper and suspensor throughout seed development. <P>
