Post doctoral position in Plant Molecular Genetics
Post doctoral position available immediately to investigate genetic basis of plant root 
development in response to rhizospheric signals.  The researcher will be a member of a 
multi-institutional team using comparative genomic approaches to understand the 
evolution of parasitism in higher plants.  The post doctoral fellow will use bioinformatic 
approaches to identify parasitic plant specific genes, make inhibitory RNA constructions 
with selected candidates, use Agrobacterium to transform RNAi constructions into 
parasitic plants, and microscopically monitor and document transgenic phenotypes.  The 
position is funded by the NSF Plant Genome Program at a salary commensurate with 
experience.  Email statement of interest, curriculum vitae, and names of three references
