Postdoctoral Position University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute
Plant Virus – Host Interactions
Position #300952
 
A postdoctoral position is available in Dr. James Culver’s Laboratory at the Center for 
Biosystems Research at the University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute, College 
Park MD (http://www.umbi.umd.edu/CBR).   This project is funded by the USDA-NRI 
and is focused on understanding the biology of virus induced plant disease.  Specific 
areas of interest include the identification and characterization of host factors that 
modulate disease development.  Additional efforts will focus on understanding the 
mechanisms viruses employ to reprogram the cellular environment and promote their 
own replication and spread.    The successful candidate will be responsible for guiding 
his/her individual research project, providing advice to junior members of the lab, and 
assisting collaborators with specific experiments.  The candidate is also expected to 
communicate his/her results in both oral and written forms.  
 
To apply send CV, the names of three references and a summary of research
