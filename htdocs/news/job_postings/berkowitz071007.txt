Postdoc Position: Patch clamp electrophysiologist

 

A scientist with prior patch clamp experience (including use of Pclamp for 
current analysis) is sought to join a group characterizing plant calcium-
conducting cyclic nucleotide gated channels. Channel properties as well as the 
role the channels play in plant innate immune signaling will be the focus of the 
research. The project will involve channel recordings from native plant cell 
membranes, as well as from oocytes and HEK cells expressing channel constructs. 
The scientist will have an opportunity to learn molecular biology research 
approaches, as well as training in use of any of the channel characterization 
systems. Salary: approximately $45,000 depending on experience. Contact: Gerry
