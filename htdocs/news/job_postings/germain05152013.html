<p>*The laboratory of Functionnal Genomics and Effector Biology invites 
applications at the Ph.D. level for a project in Molecular Plant-Microbe 
Interaction.* 
</p>
<p>
Located in Trois-Rivières, Qc, Canada, the University of Trois-Rivières is 
a research focused institution that provides extraordinary support to its 
graduate students. The project hosted in the Germain lab ( 
www.germainhugo.com) focuses on pathogen effector biology with an emphasis 
on Arabidopsis immunity and immunity targets of biotrophic pathogen 
effectors. Additional research is also conducted on mRNA export and nuclear 
proteomic.

<p>
The candidate should have a strong background in molecular biology and 
plant biology. Competence and experience in plant-microbe interaction, 
genomics, bioinformatics, cellular biology and Arabidopsis growth and 
genetics are assets. The objectives of the research program are to discover 
plant target of effectors, and discover Arabidopsis R-gene that confer 
resistance to non-host effector to engineer resistance in crop species. 
</p>
<p>
The candidate must hold, a Master Degree (or must be finishing a Master 
degree) or equivalent diploma, and should have an exceptional academic 
record. Excellence of the candidate, both at the academic level and in 
research as well the fit of the candidate with the proposed project based 
on previous experience and interest of the candidate will be decisive 
factors. The candidates must provide a list of their publication in peer 
reviewed journal and the name of two references. Interested candidate can 
send their CV to *germainhugo@gmail.com*.
