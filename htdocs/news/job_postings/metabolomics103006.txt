Plant Molecular Biologist: Metabolomics
 

The new Department of Cell and Systems Biology at the University of Toronto invites 
applications for a tenure track faculty position to be appointed at the Assistant Professor 
level in the area of Plant Molecular Sciences to begin July 1, 2007. 

 

Our vision is to advance systems biology in the area of Plant Metabolomics. Consequently, 
candidates must have demonstrated excellence in addressing fundamental questions in plant 
biology (particularly plant biochemistry, plant development or plant microbe interactions) 
using a metabolomics approach. Individuals with experience in high-throughput metabolomics 
analysis, method development for metabolite profiling, integration of metabolomics data into 
systems level analysis and/or computational analysis of complex metabolomics data are 
particularly encouraged to apply.

 

Candidates should have at least two years of research experience beyond their doctoral degree. 
In addition to pursuing a vigorous research program, the successful candidate will be expected 
to contribute to undergraduate and graduate teaching in molecular life sciences including the 
newly formed Cell and Systems Biology undergraduate program. She or he would also be expected 
to interact with faculty across campus working in related fields. There will be a generous 
start-up package and salary will be commensurate with qualifications and experience.

 

Applicants should arrange to have at least three letters of recommendation sent directly to 
the address below.  In addition, applicants should forward their curriculum vitae, copies of 
significant publications, and statements of research and teaching interests to the Chair, 
Plant Metabolomics Search Committee, Department of Cell and Systems Biology, University of 
Toronto, 25 Harbord Street, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5 Canada by November 1st, 2006. Inquiries 
should be directed to Professor Peter McCourt at mccourt@botany.utoronto.ca.

 

The University of Toronto offers the opportunity to teach, conduct research and live in 
one of the most diverse cities in the world, and is responsive to the needs of dual career 
couples.  The University of Toronto is strongly committed to diversity within its community 
and especially welcomes applications from visible minority group members, women, 
Aboriginal persons, persons with disabilities, members of sexual minority groups, and 
others who may contribute to the further diversification of ideas.

 

All qualified candidates are encouraged to apply; however, Canadians and permanent residents will be given priority.
