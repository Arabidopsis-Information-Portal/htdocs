POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH ASSOCIATES
John Browse, Institute of Biological Chemistry

Molecular-Genetics of Jasmonate Signaling
Metabolic Engineering of Oilseeds

I am looking for three well-trained, eager and imaginative scientists to join 
two projects in my laboratory.  One project aims to engineer the pathways of 
lipid synthesis in oilseeds to produce improved vegetable oils.  The second is 
an investigation of core jasmonate signaling during stamen and pollen 
development in Arabidopsis.

I am not looking for specific experience in any of these areas so much as 
wanting to identify well-trained, highly-motivated, and enthusiastic researchers 
who will make important and exciting discoveries in these research areas.  
Applicants should have experience in biochemistry, genetics and/or molecular 
biology but prior work with plants is not essential.  My laboratory of 15 
graduate students and postdocs already has projects on fatty acid and lipid 
synthesis, and on jasmonate signaling.  You can find out more about my research 
program through http://ibc.wsu.edu/research/browse/index.htm.  and PubMed.  The 
Institute of Biological Chemistry at Washington State University is an excellent 
and very supportive research environment (http://ibc.wsu.edu).

The positions will be available from March (but the start date is flexible) for 
an initial period of one year.  Reappointment for up to three years is expected.  
Salary will be commensurate with experience.  Review of applications will begin 
immediately, and continue until the positions are filled.  Send curriculum 
vitae, a statement of research interests and career goals, representative 
publications, and three letters of reference to:
