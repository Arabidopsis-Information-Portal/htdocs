In preceding experiments (Kranz, 1977) the effect of different
qualities of actinic light on seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana were
studied regarding certain photomorphoses, i.e., changes of hypocotyl
length and pigments. Now we were interested, whether and in what
degree this photomorphoses could be induced, if the actinic light is
only applicated to the seedlings for several hours (32 hours) at
different stages of development, and not continuously. During the rest
of the experiment the seedlings were kept under continuous white light
(WL). If under that conditions the photomorphoses are induced at
variant degrees, this argues for differential gene activity, started
at particular times according to the special developmental stages.
Judging by appearances they are set off by the changed light
qualities, physiologically the changed light qualities; i.e., far red
(FR), red (R) and in a certain degree blue light (B), have an effect
on the phytochrome condition of the seedling. Analogous inhibitor
experiments are needed to confirm this assumption of differential gene
activity; they have already been started with some progress (Kranz,
1978).<p>

Material and Methods<p>

For this experiment with different light qualities the green-white
marbled mutant im 52 is very convenient, because its amount of leave
pigment is more variable than that of the wild type for instance. The
seeds of im 52 were surface sterilized for 20 minutes in
calciumhypochloride (4 p.c.) and sown in strile Petri dishes on
standard agar medium according to Redei (1965) plus 1 x 10E-6M IAA and
caseinhydrolysate (1g per liter). To be protected against drying the
dishes were closed with parafilm.<p>

Then the seeds were photoinduced with 15 minutes FR, to obtain a
standardized proportion of the physiologically active form of
phytochrome, Pfr, to the total amount of phytochrome, Ptot, which is
after the application of FR about 0.025 (Mohr, 1972), and then with 30
minutes R to stimulate the germination of the seeds. Subsequently the
dishes were kept in darkness for 48 hours at 4*degrees*C and for 72
hours at 22*degrees*C. After this pretreatment the dishes stayed under
WL- *lambd* = 436 to 640 nm; 3.72 "micro"W cm -2. - for seven days, except
during the treatment with 2 hours actinic light.<p>

Two to three dishes at a time with about 100 seeds each were kept for
32 hours in cabinets with FR, R or B, respectively, after they have
been under WL for a certain time. The conditions of actinic light were
as follows:<p>

The actinic light was applied after the seedlings had been for 0, 14,
24, 40, 48 or 72 hours, respectively, under WL. Control treatments
were under WL for the whole experiment.<p>

For each start the mean germination rate (x) of the dishes and its
standard deviation (sx) were determined. In the same way the
hypocotyl length in mm was studied, for which 8-10 seedlings (n) per
dish were measured. We started the experiment three times to study the
effect of B or R, respectively, and one time with respect to FR. A
pigment extract was prepared with the seedlings of the two to three
repetition dishes together and the extinctions at 440, 647 and 664 nm
were measured spectrophotometrically (Kranz, 1971). The extinctions
were used to calculate the content of chlorophyll a (Chl a),
chlorophyll b (Chl b) and carotenoids (Car.) separately, whereas the
graphs show the relation between the sum of these pigments and the
time of application of the actinic light.<p>

The average over the means of the separate starts were calculated for
the tables and the graphs. The tables do not contain germination
rates, because there were no significant differences compared with the
control and in between them. To determine the effects of FR, till now,
there has only been carried out one experiment, although with three
repetition dishes; therefore we have only one value for the leaf
pigments.<p>

Results<p>

Photomorphosis of the hypocotyl length:<p>

The three different qualities of light show distinct effects on the
hypocotyl length of the seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana (Figure 1).
R increases the length to more than the 2-fold and FR or B inhibit the
hypocotyl growth significantly, in the course of which however B
results in a weak lengthening, when it is applicated at a time between
O and 15 hrs. after the beginning of the experiment. The effects are
most significant, when the light is given after 40 hours WL
pretreating; R was only tested at 48, but not at 40 hours
additionally. Therefore we have the maximum at 48 hours, though it
might be at 40 hours too.<p>

Photomorphosis with respect to the pigment production:<p>

The following Table (Tab.1) represents the amount of Chl a, Chl b, and
Car. in ???/100 seedlings.<p>

R does not influence the production of any of the examined pigments.
All values lie in the range of the control.<p>

FR produces the strongest change of the pigment content. It results in
an increase of the carotenoids to the 26-fold, of chlorophyll a to the
15-fold and of chlorophyll b to the 8.5-fold.<p>

B also results in an increase; the carotenoids raise to the 10-fold,
chlorophyll a to the 5.8-fold and chlorophyll b to the 2.5-fold, which
is still clear above the upper tolerance of the control.<p>

Table 2: Effects of 32 hours actinic light compared with effects of
continuous actinic light; values of pigments in ???/100 plants (above)
and relative to the control (below), hypocotyl length in mm and p.c.<p>

The carotenoids raise up strongest, but they form the smallest part of
the pigments, i.e., 11 p.c. of the control; this value increases to
18.5 p.c. after treatment with FR in the sequence of 15 hours WL,
where the increase of Car. is most distinct.<p>

Each quality of light shows a uniform effect on Chl and Car., i.e.,
either positive or negative - or no effect in the case of R -, though
in different degrees. Therefore the general effects can be described
by the changes of the sum of pigments, which are plotted in Figure 2.
The increase of pigment is in all cases the highest, if the light is
applicated after 15 hours. WL, i.e., the actinic light is effective
between 15 and 47 hours after the seedlings came under WL. This is the
developmental stage, where the cotyledons are still protected by the
seed coat for the first 16 hours; and then they grow out of the seed
coat, so that they begin to unfold at the end of the 32 hours. Still
clear effects can be found, if the treatment begins after 24 hours WL.
But here you get only the rest of the most susceptible developmental
stage. If the treatment begins after 40 hours, no effects can be
established, because pigment production is terminated at this time.
Evidently, the first light the seedlings get is decisive for the
degree of pigment production.<p>

DISCUSSION<p>

The lengthening of the hypocotyls caused by R is in agreement with the
preceding experiments (Kranz, 1977). All data collected by our group
until now with respect to this factor are combined in the following
Table 2. For the treatment with continuous R we found a 2-fold
hypocotyl lengthening compared with the control WL. Now the same
increase was verified by only 32 hours R, if the seedlings were
treated with R at a certain time (i.e., after 48 hours under WL
before). This is the time, when the seedlings start unfolding of their
cotyledons and the proper germination process is followed by further
growth. Obviously, the hypocotyl growing is most susceptible at this
time. While we found a weak increase of hypocotyl length in the
preceding experiments under continuous FR and B (Kranz, 1977), until
now our study shows a clear inhibition of growth both with continuous
and with 32 hours actinic light, where the 32 hours are still more
effective. Regarding to this more information is needed, but the
inhibitory effect of FR or B is not questionable.<p>

With respect to the pigment production the results with continuous and
32 hours light treatment also agree. By treating with 32 hours B after
15 hours WL an increase of the total pigment content to the 5.6-fold
is shown, nearly as much as by treating with continuoous B (6.1-fold).
With FR however you get a far higher increase of pigment than
expected. Instead of the 4.8-fold with continuous FR, there is an
increase to the 15.3-fold with 32 hours, but the values for FR
originate only in one experiment.<p>

The high increase of pigment by FR (Figure 2) is presently in contrast
to fundamental results generally accepted, showing that under FR
conditions no chlorophyll is produced but catabolized respectively.
But we have to remark that we have only found the increase by FR for
the mutant im 52. All the other mutants tested (Kranz, 1977) show a
decrease. Regarding the development of chloroplasts the im-mutant
shows similar reactions as isolated callus cells or leucoplasts. The
differentiation of chloroplasts can be induced by B and not by R,
which was already shown by Robbelen (1968), who used R with a center
of intensity at *lambda* = 658 nm, whereas the differentiation of
chloroplasts normally can be induced very well by R from
protochlorophyll containing proplastides. As Robbelen (1968) and Redei
(1975) discussed, it is clear, that in the im-mutant a gene is
mutated, which controls the synthesis of the RNase. It seems probable
that the catabolized RNA is necessary for the synthesis of specific
chloroplast proteins. How R, FR and B effect this gene still remains
an open question.<p>

The result that the highest increase of pigment production is reached
by a light application after 15 hours is not surprising. Robbelen
(1968) found that for the degree of greening the light conditions
between 16 and 36 hours after the seedlings came under light -
following pretreatment - are essential.<p>

Phytochrome is most effective, if the proportion of Pfr to P tot is
low, i.e., in the order of a few percent (Mohr, 1969). Under
continuous FR - where the 32 hours concern - this photostationary
state remains virtually constant over a longer period of time.
Additionally the maximal P tot is kept, whereas under continuous R -
even of low intensity - the P tot decreases rapidly with a constant
rate until a stationary state is approached, which lies something
above 30 p.c. of the P tot at FR. It is well known that with
continuous FR the hypocotyl growth is inhibited, as it is shown also
in our experiments, stimulation by R agrees with the known concept,
too, since R changes the most effective proportion Pfr/P tot very
strongly and lowers P tot.<p>

It is possible to explain the inhibitory effect of B partly on the
basis of the phytochrome, because phytochrome can absorb B and,
additionally, a blue light sensor pigment interferes with the
phytochrome effects (Presti & Delbruck, 1978). Riboflavin and some
carotenoids - especially *beta*-carotene - are most likely candidates
for the blue light photoreceptor(s), which acts also separately from
phytochrome in lower organisms (fungi etc.). Our results argue for a
special blue light photoreceptor too, because P 660 and P 730 absorb B
of 436 nm in nearly the same degree. If only the absorbing phytochrome
would cause the effect of B, it is not explainable, why the effect of
FR agrees with that of B and the effect of R is contrary to that of B.<p>

The most important result of our present experiment is that the
photomorphoses of im 52 (hypocotyl lengthening, changes of pigments)
can be set off by 32 hours actinic light in the same degree as by
continuous light of the special quality, if it is given at certain
developmental stages. Partly still higher effects are reached under
the treatment with 32 hours. The certain developmental stages are not
the same for the two examined photomorphoses. With respect to the
pigment production the seedlings are most sensitive at the stage,
where the cotyledones are growing out of the seed coat, while the
hypocotyl length varies strongest, when the proper germination process
is succeeded by further growing of the seedling. This result argues
for differential gene activity, which is set off at certain
developmental stages by actinic light of different qualities, which is
absorbed by photychorome and/or a blue light photoreceptor
respectively.<p>
