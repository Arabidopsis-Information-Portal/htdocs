Studies on heterosis had been realised with Arabidopsis thaliana for
many traits as earliness of flowering (VAN DER VEEN, J.H. 1965) or
heterosis expression under effects of different temperature levels
(LANGRIDGE, J. 1962) or in various conditions of environment
(GRIFFING, G. and ZSIRES, E. 1971) and many others.  In relation with
quantitative point of view we have realised an anlaysis of the rosette
diameter length at different stages of the the growth.<p>

Five inbred lines of Arabidopsis thaliana had been chosen; A5 (Dijon,
France), A9 (Eastland Baltique), A64 (Edinburgh, Scotland), A51
(Bologna, Italia), A80 (Turin, Italia).  Observations of flowering
time of these lines show that A51 and A80 are the latest.  The
experiment had been designed as incomplete diallel crosses, described
by GRIFFING, B. (1956) method 2, including the 5 foregoing lines taken
as parents and their 10 direct combinations. Reciprocal crosses are
not used here.<p>

F-generation of all these crosses and parents are arranged according
to a sixteen complete and randomized blocks design (finally 16
repititions for each paent or F1), disposed under a light varying from
6000 to 8000 lux, 18 hours a day.  Plants are grown in "jiffy pots" (6
cm of diameter) with a mixture of vegetable mould and sand.<p>

Many charactristics had been examined and will be presented elsewhere.
This paper presents only the results of analysis made on the rosette
diameter length at an early stage, 19 days after sowing, exposed in
Table 1.<p>

sowing, parents are diagonal)<p>

Data of Table 1 show a real superiority for a large number of the
hybrids in relation to their parents. These differences had been
analysed by using the quantity of heterosis expressed according to
FALCONER, D.S. (1960) which is as follows:<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol11/vol11-pg15-fig1.gif">Click here for figure</a><p>

the quantity of heterosis expressed on phenotype is measured on the
rosette diameter by the difference:<p>

The significance of this difference had been examined with a STUDENT
t-test at a 5 p.c. level of probability.<p>

Table 2 summaizes the quantities Hf1 obtained with this material
disposed according to an increasing arrangement as well as the gain of
the hybrid (in percent relatively to the mean parent), and the results
of the t-test at a 5 p.d.-level of significance.<p>

Table 2: Analysis of the quantity of heterosis (NS = not significant S
= significant at 5 p.c., TS = at 1 p.c. HS = at 0.1 p.c.<p>

According to these results we may conclude that there is an evidence
for phenomena in rosette diameter length, whose expression is
effective at the early stages of the growth, and magnitude is varying
in relation to the parents crossed. Further observations on this
material have indicated a persistance of this effects on the rosette
diameter length until the end of its growth, (about 50 days after
sowing).<p>

Hypothesis of genetic causes of the quantitative differences observed
seems to be plausible.  In respect to this hypthesis the analysis of
the data by the diallel cross method (GRIFFING, B. 1956) indicates
clearness of high specific combining ability.  On the other hand some
other characteristic such as the spike length present the same kind of
result.<p>
