Postdoctoral position available

Postdoctoral position in small RNA-mediated epigenetic modifications
Gregor Mendel Institute of Molecular Plant Biology,
Vienna, Austria


The research group of Marjori and Antonius Matzke is seeking an enthusiastic and self-motivated 
individual to fill a postdoctoral position in their lab starting November 2010. The successful 
applicant will be involved in identifying and analyzing mutants defective in RNA-directed DNA 
methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana (Matzke et al. (2009) Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 21: 367; Kanno et 
al., (2010) EMBO Reports 11:69; Gao et al. (2010) Nature 465: 106). 
Applicants should hold a PhD and have a strong background in molecular biology, including techniques 
in RNA analysis and bisulfite sequencing to analyze DNA methylation. Experience in Arabidopsis 
cultivation and genetics, including map-based cloning, as well as genomics and computational 
approaches are strong advantages. The position is for one year with the possibility for an extension 
of up to two years after evaluation.

The Gregor Mendel Institute of Molecular Plant Biology (GMI), which is located at the Vienna
