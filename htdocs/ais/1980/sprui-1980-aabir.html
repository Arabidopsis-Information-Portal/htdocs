Recently we have reported on the isolation of a number of mutants of
Arabidopsis thaliana, characterized by abnormally long hypocotyls when
grown in white light. These genotypes differed individually both in
their action spectra for the inhibition of hypocotyl elongation and in
the spectrophotometrically detectable phytochrome content of the
hypocotyl tissue (Koornneef et al., 1980).<p>

Seeds of wild type Arabidopsis require light for the induction of
germination and Shropshire et al. (1961) have shown that phytochrome
is the pigment involved in this response. In view of the differences
in spectral sensitivity for hypocotyl inhibition displayed by our
mutant lines, it appeared desirable also to test the light induced
germination in five of our mutants, representing mutations at 5
different loci. Details about isolation and other data were published
previously (Koornneef et al., 1980). The mutants used in the present
study were 21.84 (hy-1); T076 (hy-2); B064 (hy-3); 2.23N (hy-4) and
Ci88 (hy-5). Seeds were harvested from batches of plants grown
together in late summer 1979. It should be stated that in our
experience the degree of dormancy varies markedly with the growing
season. The seed lots used in the present experiments, including wild
type, proved relatively heavily dormant. Seeds from plants grown
during winter in the glass house usually are much less dormant and in
this way we have even obtained seeds of hy-2 lines that show up to
100% germination under continuous white light.<p>

Figure 1: Dose response curves<p>

Seeds were imbibed in lots of 50 in small petri dishes on 5 layers of
4.5 cm diam. filter paper disks (Ederol 15), moistened with either 1.5
ml distilled water or 1.5 ml of a 0.001 M solution of KNO3. The dishes
were kept in the dark at 2 *degrees*C for six days before the
irrradiations with red light at 20%degrees*C. Germination percentages
were determined after an additional incubation in the dark at
20*degrees*C for four days.<p>

The light source was a 500 W slide projector with an interference
filter for 659 nm (H.W.12nm). Irradiations were given for an exposure
time of 1 min. except for the highest dose (1.32 x 10 4 J mE-2) which
required an exposure time of 10 minutes. Different light intensities
were obtained by the use of calibrated neutral density filters (Schott
u. Gen., type NG). Phytochrome estimations were performed as reported
previously (e.g., Kendrick et al., 1969).<p>

Figure 1 shows the dose response curves for wild type Arabidopsis
seeds and for those of four mutants. No curve is given for mutant
T076(hy-2) since no significant germination response was observed at
doses up to the highest (>10 4 J mE-2) that could be given in these
experiments. Table 2 summarizes some of the data as well as the
results of the phytochrome estimations.<p>

DISCUSSION<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol17/vol17-pg140-tab1.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

In seeds as well as in hypocotyl tissue, phytochrome contents differ
considerably between wild type and the various mutants. However, the
two are by no means parallel and especially in hy-3 and hy-5 a
remarkable discrepancy is observed in this respect between seeds and
hypocotyls. On the whole a rough correlation is apparent between the
germination response at an intermediate dose (100 J mE-2) and the
phytochrom content of the seeds. In this context, mutant T076(hy-2)
can be described as "phytochromeless". Remarkably, all mutants can
reach appreciable germination percentages upon prolonged irradiation
(with white light) except that even under these conditions, this
particular batch of hy-2 still remains a poor germinator. This
behaviour is difficult to understand if the germination response is
supposed to depend uypon a single low energy phytochrome reaction
since a red dose of 1000 J mE-2 should be more than ample to establish
the photostationary state of phytochrome. This aspect is at present
under investigation.<p>

In all cases the presence of low concentrations of KNO3 promoted light
induced germination but had no significant influence upon the dark
germination, which was low in all genotypes tested. We have also
obtained evidence that the presence of filter paper has an effect,
qualitatively similar to that of nitrate and additive to the latter.<p>

We intend to determine detailed action spectra for the germination
responses for several of our mutants.<p>
