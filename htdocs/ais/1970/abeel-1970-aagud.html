In three preceding articles (ABEELS, 1968; ABEELS and DIGNEFFE, 1969;
ABEELS and DUBOIS, 1969) the existence of DNA- and tRNA-methylases was
shown in Arabidopsis thaliana.  For each enzyme the assay was
performed with a heterologous source of nucleic acid, because it was
so far accepted at least for bacteria that a homologous methylation is
impossible except for a specific mutant of E. coli (58/161 RCrel met-)
and, more recently, for a yeast mutant with a similar genetic
modification (KJELLIN-STRABY and BOMAN, 1968).<p>

The activity of tRNA-methylases was well proven to vary quantitatively
in the insect Tenebrio molitor and in virus infected bacteria, while a
qualitative variation was found in tumourous cells (BALIGA et al.,
1965; WAIFAN et al., 1965; MAGEE et al., 1966).  More recently
KALOUSEK and MORRIS (1969) demonstrated that also a homologous
methylation of DNA from pea seedlings may occur.  Results of our own
experiments, based on methylation of both, DNA and tRNA, also point
towards a homologous methylation during different developmental
periods of Arabidopsis thaliana.  The DNA-methylases of Arabidopsis,
just as those of pea seedlings or tissues, are bound to insoluble
material; but tRNA-methylases, similar to those of bacteria, are
soluble and further purification of these enzymes may therefore be
more readily achieved. Whereas KALOUSEK and MORRIS believe homologous
methylation to be just unusual, our hypothesis is that specific
variations of the methylation of both, DNA and tRNA, occur during the
development of the plant, thus varying the genetic information.<p>

Experimental procedure.  The same technics were used as those reported
in No. 5 and 6 of this newsletter.  The DNA-methylases were available
only in crude protein extracts; but the tRNA-methylases were purified
by precipitation with ammonium sulfate (30-50%) and by DEAE-cellulose
chromatography.  Nucleases were inhibited in the incubation mixture
and during the extraction by bentonite or polyvinyl sulfate (BONOTTO
and JACOBS, 1968; ABEELS, 1970).<p>

Results.  The DNA methylases are bound to insoluble material after a
centrifugation at 30.000 x g.<p>

This experiment also proves the existence of a species homologous
methylation in Arabidopsis.  Another homologous methylation results
from a crude extract of Arabidopsis mixed in the incorporation mixture

It is also possible to supply different crude extracts from the same
plant with purified tRNA from Arabidopsis.<p>

Conclusion.  We have shown that a species homologous methylation can
occur for both, DNA and tRNA.  We believe that methylation plays an
important role in cell differentiation.<p>
