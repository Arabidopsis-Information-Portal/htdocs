Postdoctoral Fellowships at Purdue University

Two postdoctoral positions are available in the areas of cell signaling and 
morphogenesis, with an emphasis on figuring out how plant cells generate and use 
the cytoskeleton during growth. One project is centered on understanding the 
spatial and temporal control of ROP family small GTPase signaling in the context 
of leaf epidermal morphogenesis. A functional understanding of SPIKE1 (Qiu et 
al., Plant Cell 2001) constitutes the foundation of this project. Another 
project focuses on the mechanisms by which plants cells generate new actin 
filament networks in response to ROP signals (see Szymanski, Curr. Opin. Plant 
Biol., 2005). The WAVE-ARP2/3 pathway affects many aspects of plant development, 
yet the components of the pathway are not all identified and their cellular 
functions are not known. This project will focus on the interface of the actin 
cytoskeleton with the endomembrane system. Both projects have extensive 
collections of mutants, localization tools, and recombinant proteins at your 
disposal. Applicants should have experience in biochemistry and/or cell and 
molecular biology.

Interested individuals should send their CV and a statement of research 
interests to: Dr. Dan Szymanski, Purdue University, Department of Agronomy.
