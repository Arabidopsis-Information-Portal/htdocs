INTRODUCTION<p>

As has been shown in our previous work (Shevchenko and Grinikh, 1985)
Arabidopsis thaliana wild types En and Co and natural forms So-1 and
Kho-1 (the latter two were just selected from natural populations) did
not differ in respect to the number of genetically effective cells
(GECN) which formed main racemes. In dormant seeds GECN was determined
to be 1.3 to 1.5 after making the initial cells of the apex with
mutations induced by gamma rays (scoring of these mutations was made
by embryo test). As has been shown in the material studied, GECN was
several times higher (4.7 to 6.5) after marking the initial cells at
the rosette state and it was noted that in plants with vigorous
racemes GECN was higher than in plants with weak racemes. There was no
correlation between rosette size of En, Co, So-1 and Kho-1 and their
GECN.<p>

In special experiments the initial cells of the wild type Co were
marked at rosette stage, and then the plants were divided into two
groups which were grown under different conditions (Shevchenko and
Grinikh, 1984). In the apexes of the plants grown under conditions
which promoted the development of more vigorous racemes (soil culture)
higher GECN were determined compared with GECN in the apexes of the
plants grown in tube culture.<p>

This paper presents the results of the study of generative tissue
chimerism induced by irradiation in dormant seeds and in plants at
rosette stage in several families selected from natural population
Shakdara (Sha). This population lives under extreme climatic
conditions in Pamiro-Alay (Tadjikistan) at 3400m altitude. Seeds of
this population were kindly supplied by KhKh. Khurmatov (Institute of
General Genetics Acad. Sci. USSR, Moscow). Sha population has the
highest habitat for Arabidopsis population described in literature
(Khurmatov, 1982). It is characterized by predominance of the forms
having a short vegetative period and a high level of genetic changes
(Khurmatov, 1983). As this population is extremely heterogenous
(especially as to flowering time of the plants) we have selected
several families which had the shortest flowering time and had no
spontaneous embryonic lethal and chlorophyll mutations. In this
material we induced mutations in initial cells of the apex by gamma
rays in dormant seeds and in plants at rosette stage. Then we compared
some growth characteristics and chimerism in main racemes observed in
these families with those in wild type Co.<p>

MATRIALS AND METHODS<p>

About 500 seeds of Sha population were sown in soil (21-24*degrees*C,
continuous illumination) and 20 plants with the shortest flowering
time were selected. In each plant 10 siliques of the main raceme were
analyzed by embryo test. Two plants were heterozygotes for embryonic
lethals and the other two plants were hemi-sterile. We removed them
and collected seeds from each of the 16 plants. The results of
studying 5 families with the shortest time (no. 1-5) of Sha population
are given below.<p>

Mutations were induced by gamma rays; the dose for dormant seeds was
370 Gy and for plants at rosette stage (9-days old plants) was 37 Gy.
The frequencies of mutant plants were 10 to 15%. In each experiment
100 seeds (or plants at the rosette stage) of wild type Co and 200
seeds (or plants at the rosette stage) of one of five selected
families of Sha were irradiated simultaneously. Thus, there were
carried out 5 experiments on marking the initial cells in dormant
seeds and 5 experiments on marking the initial cells in 9-days old
plants.<p>

Plants were grown in tubes on minimal agar medium under continuous
illumination at 21-24*degrees*C because we earlier noted that a number
of plants of Sha population proved to be hemi-sterile at higher
temperature.<p>

The rate of plant development was characterized by the number of days
from sowing to flowering of 50% of the plants. Plant growth was
estimated by the following quantitative characters: number of leaves
(rosette and stem ones), plant height (up to the first silicula and
total height), number of siliques on the main raceme, dry weight of
above-ground part of the plant after finishing the embryo test. In
each variant we made measurements of the first half of the plants
scored by embryo tests. Carrying out the embryo test we scored only
chlorophyll deficient mutations irrespectively of the embryo size. 5
siliques were scored on each main raceme after irradiation of dormant
seeds and 15 siliques were scored after irradiation of plants at the
rosette stage. GECN was calculated on the basis of mutant sector size,
percent of mutant siliques on mutant plants (Li and Redei, 1969).<p>

RESULTS<p>

As can be seen in Table 1, after marking the initial cells in dormant
seeds of wild type Co GECN was equaled to 1.5 (mean for 5
experiments). We have determined the same value in our previous work
(Shevchenko and Grinikh, 1985) where plants of wild type Co were grown
in soil culture after irradiation of dormant seeds. In the five
families of Sha populations studied GECN was ranged 1.5 to 1.8 (1.6 on
the average). There was no significant difference between the most
different families no. 2 and no. 4 (.90 P<.95). Statistical values
were calculated for percents of mutant siliques which were taken as a
basis for GECN calculation. There was no significant difference
between GECN in wild type Co and the average GECN for the 5 families
of Sha population (P<.90). The GECN determined in dormant seeds of the
material studied was similar to those determined in the other wild
types (Ivanov, 1974) and natural forms (Shevchenko and Grinikh, 1985).<p>

Table 2: GECN in wild type Co and in five families of Sha population
of A. thaliana after marking of the initial cells at the rosette stage
(37 Gy gamma rays, tube culture).<p>

The data presented in Table 2 shows that after marking the initial
cells at the rosette stage GECN was higher than after marking at the
dormant seed stage. In wild type Co GECN was equal to 4.2. In our
previous experiments with wild type Co (Shevchenko and Grinikh, 1985)
we obtained GECN equaled to 3.7 for this stage of development (tube
culture, 23-25*degrees*C). In all five families of Sha population GECN
was higher than in wild type Co and ranged from 5.2 to 7.0. The
differences between the families were insignificant: between the most
different families no. 2 and no. 5 (.90<P<P.95). It should be noted
that average GECN for the 5 families (5.870 was significantly higher
(P>.99) than for wild type Co (4.2).<p>

In Tables 3 and 4 the data on growth and development of the plants in
which GECN was determined are preesnted. Measurements were made in the
experiments in which plants were irradiated at the rosette stage. The
dose applied did not appreciably affect the values of characters
studies; there were about 95% of those in control plants. So we think
that these data may be used for a comparative analysis of the material
studied.<p>

Table 3: The rate of plant development of wild type Co and five
families of Sha population of A. thaliana (37 Gy gamma rays, rosette
stage, tube culture).<p>

The Sha families somewhat differed from each other as to their
developmental rate (Table 3): 50% of their plants began flowering
after 24-26 days (25.0 days on the average). However, all of them
started flowering earlier than wild type Co in which 50% of the plants
were flowering after 28 days.<p>

To evaluate plant growth we measured quantitative characters (Table
4). Comparing the man values of these characters in separate families
of population Sha it should be noted that family no. 5 which had the
highest GECN after irradiation of plants at the rosette stage (7.0)
was distinguished by several quantitative characters among the
families studied. Plants of this family were the highest ones, they
had the longest main racemes (calculated as a difference between the
total height of a plant and the stam height up to the first silicula).
They also had the greatest number of siliques on their racemes and the
greatest dry weight of plants. It is necessary to note that the
differences observed were rather small and future checking is needed.
The average values of most characters determined in the Sha families
did not signifcicantly differ from those of wild type Co except for
the number of stem leaves; plants of population Sha had a higher
number of stem leaves than Co plants (4.8 and 3.0 correspondingly).<p>

DISCUSSION<p>

The results presented confirmed the increase of GECN in the course of
plant ontogenesis. This observation was made in our previous works
carried out on four A. thaliana genotypes (Shevchenko and Grinikh,
1975; 1985). It is in agreement with the data obtained on A. thaliana
wild type La erecta by Balkema (1971) who observed a decrease of
mutant sector size after EMS treatment of 8-day-old plants as compared
with that after EMS treatment of dormant seeds.<p>

In the present work marking of the initial cells of the apical
meristem with mutations induced by gamma rays was performed in dormant
seeds and in plants at the rosette stage. It allowed us to distinguish
two periods in A. thaliana ontogenesis which were characterized by
different GECN. GECN determined after marking of the initial cells in
dormant sees may be considered as minimal GECN for the period "dormant
seed - rosette" and GECN determined after marking of the initial cells
ast the rosette stage may be considered as minimal GECN for the period
"rosette - bud". This proposition is made on the basis of some data
published in literature and obtained in our work. The experiments in
which plants were grown under different conditions after induction of
mutations at the rosette stage (Shevchenko and Grinikh, 1984) showed
that some of the initial cells of the apex might loose their activity
in the period "rosette - bud" and so GECN registered may not always
characterize the stage of ontogenesis at which marking of the initial
cells took place but later stage. At the former stage GECN may be the
same or larger than at the latter stage.<p>

It's quite possible that during seed germination some initial cells
become inactive and if so, the GECN determined after marking of the
initial cells at the stage of dormant seed is equal to GECN at some
stage during the period "dormant seed-rosette". In dormant seeds GECN
may be the same or larger. The data obtained on chimerism modification
after irradiation of dormant seeds (Muller, 1964; Balkema, 1971)
suggest that if such a decrease of GECN takes place it most likely
occurs at the very beginning of seed germination. It can be also
proposed that this phenomenon promotes selection of the most viable
initial cells from the group of cells which exists in a dormant seed
apical meristem. This selection, if it really occurs, may be very
important for plant species because seeds often rest in soil for
years, and unfavourable mutations may be accumulated in the initial
cells. The cells with such mutations could be discarded as a result of
a decrease of the group of initial cells.<p>

It is interesting that GECN in dormant seeds of most plant species are
usually determined to be equal to 2-3 in spite of different numbers of
plastochrones in the primary stems of their embryos. For example in an
embryo of a dormant barley seed one can see an apical meristem, five
primordial leaves and axillary meristems in the axils of the first and
second leaves (Jacobsen, 1966). Unlike a barley embryo in dormant seed
of A. thaliana dormant seed it is possible to see only a flat apex and
primordial leaves could only be seen in the course of seed germination
(Balkema, 1971).<p>

This above mentioned, supports an idea that certain changes of GECN
take place in the apical meristem in the course of normal ontogenesis.
It is supposed that during seed germination GECN either remains the
same as it was in a dormant seed or decreases. If it decreases, it is
supposed that only the most viable initial cells will participate in
further growth and development of the plant and in the formation of
the next generation. Later in ontogenesis an increase of the initial
cell group which begins working actively after seed germination is
likely to occur.<p>

In plants of wild type Co grown in soil culture we have determined
that GECN equaled 1.5 in the period "dormant seed rosette" and 7.1
(4.7 times higher) in the period "rosette bud" (Shevchenko and
Grinikh, 1984). In the present work carried out in tube culture with
wild type Co GECN equaled 1.5 and 4.5 (2.8 times higher) and in the
five Sha families 1.6 and 5.7 (3.6 times higher) respectively. All
families of Sha population studied in tube culture had higher GECN
(5.2-7.0) than wild type Co (4.2) in the period "rosette - bud". It
should be noted that plants of Sha families developed more stem leaves
for a shorter growth period than plants of wild type Co: their average
number of stem leaves was 1.6 times higher although they began to
flower 3 days earlier than wild type Co. This fact implies a
possibility of a positive correlation between the number of
plastochrones before bud formation and GECN registered in the period
"rosette - bud" for the plants with the same flowering time.<p>

To conclude we would like to note that a short flowering time in
combination with high GECN in the period "rosette - bud" observed in
some families of population Sha may be an important factor for
adaptation to extreme high altitude conditions.<p>

SUMMARY<p>

Experiments were carried out in tube culture with A. thaliana plants
of five families selected from high-altitude natural population Sha.
Wild type Co was used for comparison. Genitically effective cell
number (GECN) in the apex of the periods "dormant seed - rosette" and
"rosette - bud" was determined on the basis of the main raceme
chimerism induced in dormant seeds and in 9-day-old plants by gamma
rays. It was shown that in the period "dormant seed - rosette" GECN in
the five Sha families did not significantly differ from each other and
from wild type Co and was equal to 1.5-1.8. In the period "rosette -
bud" GECN registered was higher. In the families of population Sha it
equaled 5.2-7.0 (2.9-4.4 times higher than in the previous period) and
in wild type Co GECN 4.2 (2.8 times higher than in the previous
period). The five families of population Sha surpassed wild type Co in
the rate of development. They began flowering earlier (24-26 days
after sowing) than the plants of wild type Co (28 days after sowing).
Comparison of GECN and some quantitative characters of growth and
development of the plants showed that in families of population Sha
studied a short flowering time was combined with high GECN in the
period "rosette - bud".<p>
