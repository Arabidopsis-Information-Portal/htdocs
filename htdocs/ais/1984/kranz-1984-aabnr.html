INTRODUCTION<p>

The biophysical properties of cosmic radiation were investigated on
Spacelab 1-mission (SL-1) by use of advanced biostacks which consisted
of monolayers of biological test organisms (dry seeds of Arabidopsis
thaliana (L.) Heynh. among others) sandwiched between foils of nuclear
track detectors of high sensitivity for heavy ions (HZE). The biostack
units were exposed at several locations of the shuttle (pallet and
module) with different radiation shielding (Schott et al., 1983).
First evaluations of the physical and biolgoical components of the
experiment indicated that in general they survived the space flight of
10 days in good condition (Kranz, 1984a; Bucker et al., 1984a) besides
few defects of insufficient sheet preparation and storage; thus the
further investigations will be carried out as designed. This is the
first report on the preliminary evaluation of total effectiveness of
cosmic radiation in Arabidopsis seeds flown during the S1-1 mission
without consideration of individual HZE-particle effects.<p>

METHODS AND MATERIALS<p>

The details of the background and aims of the experiment as well as of
the stacking of the detector units and biological objects (dry seeds
of Arabidopsis thaliana En-2, ch 2/ ch 2 and dr ascospores of Sordaria
fimicola br 1) have been already published elsewhere (Kranz, 1984a).
In order to evaluate the radiobiological effectiveness of the space
environment in eukaryotic test organisms, an ontogenetic sequence of
biotests has been elaborated which consists of<p>

(1) REM investigation of structural microlesions in the outer cell
wall of the seed coat cells or the ascospore wall respectively
(Barckhausen et al., 1981)<p>

(2) study of the germination delay and lethality of seeds or spores,<p>

(3) measurement of the growth inhibition of seedlings root or of the
spore germ tube,<p>

(4) observation of the morphogenetic defects of seedlings or spores<p>

(5) investigation of the mitotic and meiotic chromosome aberrations,
in root meristem or pollen mother cells (Koller-Lampert and Kranz,
1982), or asci, respectively<p>

(6) study of the reproductive sterility of fruits (embryo lethality,
or of asci (spore lethality) belonging to the M 2-generation, and<p>

(7) estimation of the mutant frequency or mutation rate in the M
2-generation with final proof of M 3.<p>

This set of biotests proved to be highly sensitive to HZE in
accelerator experiments at the UNILAC of GSI, Darmstadt. Besides
numbers (1) and (5) the tests can be easily performed with one and the
same irradiated subject (seed or spore). In biotest no. (7) mutation
was calculated by use of different formulas adapted to the unicellular
(spores) or multicellular object (seeds), respectively:<p>

The data obtained by the biotests differentiate between the somatic
physiological (nos. (1) to (4) and the generative genetic response
(nos. (5) to (7) of the diplontic Arabidopsis, and in an altered
sequence of the haplontic Sordaria. In this way we may contribute to a
better understanding of the early and late effects of cosmic
HZE-radiation in eukaryotic organisms.<p>

RESULTS AND CONCLUSION<p>

After receipt of the destacked monolayers in January 1984 sixteen seed
samples (>150 seeds per detector sheet) were tested in order to secure
a general information on the survival as well as to obtain
indispensable control data of the general effectiveness of total
cosmic radiation. The most significant part of it, the individualized
HZE-particle effect, will be discriminated by separate studies.<p>

The seeds were removed from one sheet per Biostack unit of which A1-F,
A2-F and B1-F were located inside the module, and B2-F on the open
pallet; B1-B and B2-B were back up control units deposed at Kennedy
Space Center (KSC), Florida; B1-B was irradiated additionally with
Fe-ions (410 Mev/n, 6 x 10 4 p/cm 2) at the BEVALAC accelerator
Berkeley. Furthermore, a nonstacked control sheet stored at the plant
genetics lab, Frankfurt/Main (F-B) was tested as well as the original
seed material (AIS-C) conserved in the AIS-seed bank, Frankfurt/Main.<p>

The results of the biotests were:<p>

Seed germination was significantly reduced in the nonflight samples
F-B of the wild type and B2-B of the mutant (ts 2.0, *alpha* <.05)
which seems to be caused by insufficient material preparation of these
control sheets before flight. Therefore, data obtained from this
insufficient material are listed in parenthesis (Table 1).<p>

Table 1: Response of M 1-plants developed from seeds of 2 Arabidopsis
genotypes (En-2, ch 2/ch 2) flown for 10 days in space during SL-1
mission.  Significant differences are signified by (****) *alpha*t &lt;0.001, rel. to B2-B, (++) *alpha*ts &lt;0.01, rel.to F-B,<p>

The radicle length decreased in the flight unit B1-F only with mutant
ch 2/ch 2, and there was a positive (B2-F) and a negative (B1-B)
response of the wild type En-2. The frequency of sublethal aberrant
plants in M 1 was significantly higher in the pallet sheet sample 
B2-F of mutant ch 2/ch 2 ts&gt; 6.0. *alpha*&lt;.001). However, the increase
of sublethals was not significant in the wild type seeds flown in the
module.<p>

The percentage of embryonic lethals (M 2) developed in fruits of M
1-plants was significantly higher for the B1-F of the module but not
for the pallet (B2-F) Table 2). Total mutation frequency mc and the
mutation rate R increased in the flight unit sample to some but
nonsignificant extent.<p>

type seeds (En-2) flown for 10 days in space during SL-1 mission.  Significant difference (****) *alpha*ts&lt;0.001 rel. to F-B.<p>

However, the inconsistency of biological defects in certain units, for
example between the module units Al-F, A2-F and B1-F, confirms that a
more qualitative than quantitative evaluation of the cosmic radiation
spectrum is necessary. Furthrmore, the comparison of the effective
range of HZE-particicle fluxes produced gy tthe UNILAC-accelerator,
which amounts to 10 6- 10 8 p/cm 2 for 50% lethality of seeds (Kranz,
1984a, b; Bork and Kranz, 1984), with the total HZE-flux of max. 10
p/cm 2 for the SL-1 mission (Bucker, 184b), shows the necessity of a
more qualitative study than a total dose estimation of the cosmic
radiation and its values of relative biological effectiveness (RBE).
This will be done by studies of the correlation between the linear
energy transfer (LET) of HZE-particles or disintegration stars of
nuclear reactions and their RBE-data which have recently been started.<p>

Figure 1: Quantity of nuclear fission stars per seed shadow detected
in K5-emulsion sheets flown for 10 days in space on the shuttle module
and pallet, respectively during SL-1 mission<p>

Preliminary microscopic estimation of tracks (*phi* &gt; 1.5 micro m) and of stars nearest
to the object as shown by the back cover photo of this volume (AIS no.
21) revealed that the number of both nuclear vents is evidently higher
in the pallet unit than inside the module (Kranz, 1984a). This
increase correlates with the lower shielding of units expected in the
free space which is substantiated by the factor 4 for detector K5 and
1.5 for the plastic detector CN. The difference confirms the higher
sensitivity of the emulsion K5 for ions of lowe atomic number Z; just
so that quantity of stars per seed in K5 is significantly higher in
the pallet than in the module detectors (Figure 2) which additionally
demonstrates the shielding effect already mentioned.<p>

SUMMARY<p>

All in all total evaluation of cosmic radiation effectiveness without
discrimination of individualized HZE-ion effects in dry Arabidopsis
seeds flown for 10 days on STS-9, yielded significant evidence for
radiation damage in space in some but not in all the samples studied.
Such deleterious consequences, apparently, depend on the biological
criteria tested which stand for early effects (in M 1) and late
effects (in M 2) as well as on the genotype investigated (wild type
En-2, mutant ch 2/ch 2); and last not least they are related to the
different radiation shielding environment in the closed module and on
the open pallet.<p>
