Postdoctoral Research Associate Position.
 Postdoctoral research associate position available in the Department of Plant Biology, 
Cornell University, to join a National Science Foundation Plant Genome project 
studying the plant cell wall proteome. The successful candidate will use a range of 
computational and laboratory-based tools to characterize secreted plant protein 
populations from a number of plant species, focusing principally on tomato and 
Arabidopsis. Applicants should ideally have a background in plant cell wall biology, 
experience working with diverse molecular techniques and a familiarity with proteomics 
technologies. Strong written and oral communication skills are highly desirable. Please 
send a curriculum vitae and the names and contact information of three referees to Dr. 
Jocelyn Rose (jr286@cornell.edu). http://labs.plantbio.cornell.edu/rose
