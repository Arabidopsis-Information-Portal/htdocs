<h2>Nutritional requirements of callus from Ei-6</h2><p>

	LOEWENBERG (1965) and ZIEBUR (1965) independently reported the culture of Arabidopsis callus on complex media.  SHEN-MILLER and SHARP (1966) grew their cultures on a simple, completely defined medium.  A callus culture from the strain Ei-6 that grows on a completely defined medium requires for optimum growth urea, a more potent auxin and a lower salt concentration than the callus that SHEN-MILLER and SHARP studied.<p>

	The tissue grows much better on mineral media with a total mineral concentration of approximately 30 mM than at higher and lower concentrations (Tables 1 and 2).  Similarly the callus grows better on 1.5% glucose than at higher and lower glucose concentrations (Table 3).  The results indicate that a medium osmotic pressure of about 2.5 atm is optimal.)<p>

	Vitamins and urea can replace the undefined organics previously included in the medium (LOEWENBERG).  This strain of Arabidopsis callus which grows poorly on the simple medium of SHEN-MILLER and SHARP at the two auxin-kinin combinations tested grows better with p-chlorophenoxyacetic acid than with NAA (Table 4).<p>
