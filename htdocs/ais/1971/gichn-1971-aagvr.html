Parallel with the increasing mutation rate after mutagenic treatments,
there is an increase of some types of biological damage, such as
inhibition of germination, sterility etc.  From a certain level this
biological damage prevents the application of higher doses of mutagens
and thus limits the increase of the mutation rate. The type of damage,
which hinders the application of higher doses of mutagens, depends on
the character of the mutagen, on the treated material etc.<p>

In Arabidopsis according to the dose-response curves three types of
limiting factors for mutagenic nitrosocompounds can be demonstrated:<p>

Figures 1-3: Dose-response curves in mutation experiments with (1)
N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, (2) ethylvinylnitrosamine and (3)
dimethylnitrosamine for germination of the teated seeds (G), fertility
of the M1-plants (F) and mutation rate in the M2 (M)<p>

The first type is illustrated by the N-methyl-N-nitrosourea
dose-response curve (Figure 1).  With the increasing concentration of
the mutagenic compound, the mutation rate and sterility increases,
whereas the germination remains unchanged. This type of dose-response
curve is typical of nitrosamides (MULLER and GICHNER, 1964; MULLER
1964; GICHNER and VELEMINSKY, 1967.<p>

The second type is illustrated by the ethylvinylnitrosamine curve
(Figure 2).  The mutation curve is characterized by a similar shoulder
shape as in the case of nitrosamides; the germination, however,
declines in dependence on the increased concentration.  A similar
dose-response curve was observed following methylbenzylnitrosamine
treatment (VELEMINSKY and GICHNER, 1971).<p>

The third type is illustrated by the dimethylnitrosamine dose-response
curve (Figure 3).  The shape of the mutation and sterility curve is
roughly parabolic, characterized by an increase at lower
concentrations and by a decline nearly to the spontaneous rate at the
highest concentrations.  Germination decreases steadily with the
increased concentration.  The same curve shape is typical of
butylmethylnitrosamine (VELEMINSKY and GICHNER, 1971).<p>

From these dose-response curves follows:<p>

a) The high sterility is the factor limiting the increase of mutation
rate after treatments with nitrosamides.<p>

b) The toxic action on the seed-germination is the factor limiting the
increase of the mutation rate following treatment with
ethylvinylnitrosamine or similar compounds.<p>

c) The limiting factor for the increase of the mutation rate following
dimethylnitrosamine treatment is neither the decreased germination nor
the sterility, but the extremely high concentration itself.  This high
concentation may bring about the inhibition of enzymes or enzyme-like
system, which hydroxylate nitrosamines in vivo, and thus enable the
production of a mutagenic alkylating intermediate (VELEMINSKY and
GICHNER, 1971).<p>
