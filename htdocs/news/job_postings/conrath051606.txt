Postdoctoral Position in Molecular Plant Pathology

 

For a project that is funded by BASF Plant Science, RWTH Aachen Tech
University is currently looking for a diligent postdoc to elucidate a
plant-fungus interaction. In the first year, emphasis will be on cytological
aspects of the interaction while in the second year emphasis will be on
molecular aspects of the interaction. The position is available for two
years, with the opportunity for a third year (dependent on funding). Strong
experience with microscope analysis of plant-pathogen interactions as well
as modern molecular biological technologies is a must. Please send your cv
and have three reference letters send to:
