<h2>Presumptive evidence for the extrachromosomal nature of laggard mutants induced b 5-bromodeoxyuridine</h2><p>

In a previous note (Arabid. Inf. Serv. No. 4) a hypothesis of an
extrachromosomal basis of 5-bromodeoxyuridine activity has been
expressed, based on the high frequency and specificity of induced
variants.  For testing the validity of this hypothesis, reciprocal
crosses between viable laggards obtained in a F4-progeny from plants
treated by 5-bromodeoxyuridine and control plants have been made.
Laggard plants chosen as parents are issued from families that include
a high frequency of lethal and viable laggard seedlings.<p>

The table shows that of the progenies out of 12 crosses between
laggard ovules and control pollen, 11 gave laggard plants, lethal or
viable.  In progenies issued from the reciprocal cross, all plant
phenotypes are normal.  Arguments for the extra-nuclear heredity
hypothesis are thus 3 in number: (1) differences observed between
reciprocal crosses, (2) specificity and high frequency of variants,
(3) persistance of segregation in the progeny of laggard types.  The
physical basis of the phenomenon is unknown.<p>
