Vol 01:<h2>REDEI, G.P., and Y. HIRONO</h2><h2>Linkage studies</h2>

Only negative observation on linkage has been reported in Arabidopsis
so far (cf. KUGLER 1951).  Since the availability of properly mapped
chromosomes is an elementary prerequisite of most critical genetic
studies, the fragmentary information gathered in our laboratory will
be presented here.  Linkage intensities have been estimated in F2
populations by the product method of FISHER and BALMAKUND with the aid
of the tables constructed by F. R. IMMER (Genetics 15, 81-98, 1930,
and ibid 19, 119-136, 1934).  This technique gives almost as accurate
information as a test-cross if close linkage is tested in coupling.
Since the production of test-cross material may be very limited in the
case of weak mutants, while thousands of plants can be easily studied
in F2, the product method proved to be very useful.  Collecting
linkage information is not a very exciting and a rather tedius job
thus most of our data resulted only as a byproduct of other studies.
This also explains some of the incompleteness.<p>

So far the number of linkage groups in Arabidopsis is higher than that
of the basic chromosome number.  Present report will include
information about the better known groups.<p>

Linkage group 2.
G       a gametophyte factor, no female
        transmission, relatively fair male
        transmission
er      erecta type, slightly rounder rosette
        leaves, shorter petioles, compact
        inflorescence, blunt fruits.  Good clear
        marker.
hy      excellent seedling marker, hypocotyl more
        than twice as long as normal,  yellow green
        (pleiotropy).
py      2, 5-dimethyl, 4-aminopyrimidine requiring
vr2     virescent
re      veins are darker than interveinal tissues
as      rosette leaves, especially the first are
        asymetric and lobed.
su      yellow
se      serrated leaves

Approximate map distances and gene order:<p>

has been tested so far with only er and in a F2 population of a few
hundred individuals no double mutants were detected.  Some of the
distance e.g. between leaf colour mutants have been estimated
indirectly.  Interference has not been observed. Additivity is
reasonably normal.<p>

Linkage group 3.
In group 3 seven genes were found to be linked.  Most of them have not 
yet been studied in coupling and information about the linear order is 
not available.<p>

Linkage group 4.
According to somatic recombination studies the centromere appears to be 
on the left of xv.
xv      yellow-green, colyledons are yellow the leaf
        margin is yellowish.  3 m.u. from gi
gi1     gi2 affect photopheriodic response.  The
        vegetative stage is prolonged 2 or 3 times
        in gi 1 and 4 or 6 times in gi 2 which
        results in giant rosettes.  25 m.u. from ch.   
P       Pollen abortion factor.  The heterozygotes
        for P produces about 25-30% abortive pollen
        and the homozygote is normal.  About 3%
        recombination with gi and 12% with ch
ch1     ch2 Chlorophyll b is absent from ch and
        reduced in ch2
Gm      male gametophyte factor.  No transmission in
        male and poor transmission in female.
        Between ch and pa.
pa      dwarf and dark green.  8 m.u. from ch.
        Besides these ed (leaf and flower shape) and
        tz (thiazole requiring) may be in the same
        linkage group.<p>
