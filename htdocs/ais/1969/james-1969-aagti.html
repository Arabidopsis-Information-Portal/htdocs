A programme of study aimed at the production of resistant mutants in
Arabidopsis thaliana is under way.  For the production of mutations,
different mutagens are being used and at present EMS treatment has
given rise to a few "presumpive" mutants showing remarkable resistance
to some antimetabolites.  Presence of these substances in "adequate"
quantities could not in any way inhibit the developmental aspects,
including fertility, of these plants.  Confirmation tests are in
progress.<p>
