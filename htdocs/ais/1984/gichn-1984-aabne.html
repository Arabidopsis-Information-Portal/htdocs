<h2>DIFFERENTIAL RESPONSE OF ARABIDOPSIS SEEDS TO DIMETHYLNITROSAMINE AND DIETHYLNITROSAMINE TREATMENTS</h2>

T. Gichner, J. Veleminsky, J. Pospisil, and S.I. Demchenko<p>

Treatment of Arabidopsis seeds with the promutagen dimethyl
nitrosamine (DMN) led to an induction of embryonic and chlorophyll
mutations, while treatment with the promutagen diethylnitrosamine
(DEN) was ineffective (Veleminsky and Gichner, 1968, 1971). Recently
it has been reported that several nitrosamines, e.g., N,
N-diphenylnitrosamine, N-phenyl-N-benzylnitrosamine (Wakabayashi et
al., 1981), as well as other compounds, e.g. aniline, o-toluidine and
yellow OB (Nagao et al., 1978), were mutagenic in the Salmonella Ames
test only when norharman (gamma-carboline) was added to the incubation
mixture. The exact mechanism of the co-mutagenic action of norharman
has not yet been elucidated. but in the case of nitrosamines the
formation of N-nitrosonorharman may be one possiblility (Wakabayashi
et al., 1981).<p>

In further attempts to find out the possible mutagenic potential of
DEN in Arabidopsis seeds and seedlings we have exposed 1) seeds to DEN
in the presence of the co-mutator norharman for 24 hours, 2) seeds and
seedlings to chronic treatments with DEN for 2 weeks, since the
negative results, obtained earlier, were the results of an acute 24
hour DEN seed treatment.<p>

Seeds (about 1000) of Arabidopsis thaliana, race Dijon, were treated
with DEN without or in the presence of 20 mM norharman for 24 hours at
25*degrees*C. After the treatment the seeds were rinsed for 30 min. in
distilled water and were sown partly in Petri dishes with blotting
paper wetted by 0.1% KNO 3 for the determination of M 1 germination
and M 1 root length (Muller, 1964a) and partly seeded into soil in a
greenhouse for the mutation experiments (Muller, 1963, 1964b).<p>

As demonstrated by Figure 1A, the 24 hours treatment of Arabidopsis
seeds with DEN, either in the presence or in the absence of the
co-mutator norharman, strongly inhibited the M 1 germination and M 1
root length, but did not result in an increase in the frequency of
embryonic and chlorophyll mutations and in the degree of sterility
(e.g., data in all cases less than 1).<p>

For chronic treatment, Arabidopsis seeds sown on Petri dishes (0 70
mm), containing 20 ml of 0.7% agar with various concentrations of DEN.
After 2 weeks of cultivation at 25*degrees*C with a day of 14 hours,
the M 1 germination and M 1 root length were measured. Surviving
seedlings were transferred to a greenhouse and cultivated in soil. As
demonstated in Figure 1B, a chronic treatment of 14 days with DEN
resulted in a reduced M 1 root length, but had no effect on the
frequency of mutations. Higher concentrations of DEN could not be
applied owing to a strong inhibition of survival of treated seedlings.
The futile attempts to induce mutations in Arabidopsis by chronic
treatment with DEN and by acute treatments in the presence of the
co-mutator norharman, confirms the results earlier published that the
diethyl-containing nitrosamine has no mutagenic potential in
Arabidopsis, although in other plant species, e.g., Tradescantia and
Nicotiana it is mutagenic (unpublished results).<p>

Figure 1: Application of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and
dimethylnitrosamine on seeds of A. thaliana.  A: seeds treated with DEN in the absence or presence of norharman for 24 hr at 25 C. B: seeds cultivated for 2 wks at 25 C on agar medium containing DEN. C: seeds treated with DMN for 24 hr at 25 C.  G = % of germination; RL = root length in % of control; S = degree of sterility; M = % of M1 siliquae segregating embry9onic an chlorophyll mutants. For each dose, 150 to 300 M1 siliquae were scored.<p>

In contrast, the nitrosamine DMN, containing two methyl groups, was
highly mutagenic in Arabidopsis (Figure 1C), thus confirming the
postulation that Arabidopsis seeds contain enzymes capable of
converting promutagenic nitrosamines with a methyl group into a
mutagenic intermediate. In attempts to get a better insight into the
mechanism of the mutagenic activity of the metabolized mutagen, we
have applied DMN in the presence of various mutagenic blockers.
Comparative data with N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) not requiring
metabolic activation are also included (Table 1).<p>

The mutagenic activity of DMN was markedly reduced in the presence of
diethyldithiocarbamate, carbon monoxide and 9-hydroxyellipticine,
well-known inhibitors of mixed function oxidase enzymes (Jensen et
al., 1981; Lesca et al., 1979). Both the absence of activity of these
inhibitors on the direct acting mutagen MNU and the absence of the
inhibitory effects of monoamine oxidase substrates, favours the
involvement of the cytochrome P-450-dependent mixed function oxidase
enzymes in DMN mutagenesis in Arabidopsis.<p>

The mutagenic activity of both DMN and MNU was further reduced by high
concentrations of thiourea and cysteine. Both alkylating mutagens or
their released methyl intermediates could be scavenged by the thiol
groups of thiourea and cysteine. Glutathione and thiouracil, which
were, owing to their lower solubility applied at lower concentrations,
did not manifest any antimutagenic properties towards DMN and MNU.<p>

Plant phenolic acids have been reported to decrease the mutagenic
activity of diol epoxides of benzo(a)pyrene (Wood et al., 1982),
probably owing to their mututal interaction leading to a formation of
a nonmutagenic reaction product. The lack of antimutagenic activity of
these plant phenolic acids towards nonaromatic nitrosamines
demonstrates the differential response of various classes of mutagens
to mutagenic blockers.<p>
