We are looking for a highly motivated candidate to fill a
Ph.D. studentship. We are studying the role of bZIP transcription
factors on metabolism in response to stress. The factors regulate
genes involved in primary metabolism to reprogram
metabolism. Interestingly do hetero-dimerisation of the factors play
an important role in the gene regulatory process. We are exploring the
full range of high throughput analysis tools and therefore is
experience with microarrays, massive sequencing, metabolomics or
proteomics favorable but not an absolute requirement.
 
The successful candidate should have a university degree in biology,
favorably with the combination of plant biology and molecular
biology. The application should include personal background including
a description of undergraduate training, a complete CV, copies of
university degree and degree thesis as well as the names and e-mail
addresses to two referees.
Please contact Dr. J. Hanson (s.j.hanson@uu.nl, +31 30 2533132) for
further questions. The full application should be send by email
(s.j.hanson@uu.nl) not later than 24 Dec 2009.
