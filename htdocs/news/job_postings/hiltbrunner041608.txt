A post-doctoral position is available at the Department of Botany, Albert Ludwig 
University, Freiburg, Germany. The successful candidate will work in a research team 
studying the family of phytochrome photoreceptors in Arabidopsis. The project will focus 
on the isolation and characterisation of protein complexes involved in early steps of 
phytochrome signalling. Furthermore, the successful applicant is expected to use the 
insight gained through this work to develop phytochrome-based molecular tools for 
application in biotechnology.
