There are some investigations in which spectra of mutations induced by
the treatments of air-dry or preliminary soaked Arabidopsis thaliana
seeds with various mutagens were studied (Redei, 1970). We were
interested in the mutation spectrum of A. thaliana after treatment at
other developmental stages. In the present study we analysed the
spectrum of chlorophyll deficient embryonic mutants induced by
gamma-irradiation at different stages of development under
irradiation. All mutations were obtained in the course of the
experiments devoted to the analysis of chimerism in M1 plants.<p>

Mutations were induced by the irradiation of flowers at the
developmental stages of meiosis and embryo sac (1), of young embryos
(2), of dormant seeds (3) and of 9 to 15 days old plants (4).<p>

In Table 1 the size of embryos is indicated according to their maximum
development in suitable, for embryo test immature pods of mutant
plants. The embryos in which the formation of cotyledons and a rootlet
was only initiated were classified as "small" ones; those of normal
size or somewhat smaller were classified as "large" ones and the
others as "medium" ones.<p>

Table 1 shows that with our way of scoring after irradiation of the
plants at the 1-4 stages among chlorophyll deficient mutations there
were 29.8, 28.1, 17.3 and 21.0% of mutations with "small" embryos;
31.4, 44.6, 56.9 and 38.0% of mutations with "medium" embryos; 38.8;
27.3, 25.8 and 41.0% of mutations with "large" embryos
correspondingly. At the same stages there were 22.4, 15.4, 31.4, and
38.5% of white (or nearly white) embryos; the pale-green embryos
sharply prevailed, being 77.6, 82.2, 68.9, and 61.0% correspondingly.
Mutations with yellow embryo and with an embryo in which the
cotyledons were violet-maculated and a rootlet was green were single.
We didn't find any distinctive differences in the spectrum of
mutations depending on the stage at which the plants were irradiated.<p>

Table 1: The spectrum of embryonic mutations with chlorophyll
deficiency and different degrees of embryo development after
gamma-irradiation of A. thaliana plants at different stages of
development.<p>

In literature there are references on the changes in proportion of
chlorophyll deficient and morphological mutations after the treatment
of barley plants at some stages of development. So, after the
treatment of dormant seeds with ethylmethanesulfonate (Kiseleva et
al., 1978) and vegetative apices with ethyleimine (Batygin et al.,
1972) both chlorophyll deficient mutations and those changing ear
shape were found. In some studies after the treatment of plants at the
stage of apex transmission to generative state only moropholgical
mutations were found (Kiseleva et al., 1978) and after the treatment
of plants during the formation of the ear rudiments only chlrophyll
deficient mutations were obtained.<p>

In our work we have not observed any remarkable change in the spectrum
of embryonic mutations with chlorophyll deficiency and with different
degrees of embryo development depending on the stage of irradiations
of A. thaliana plants.<p>
