<h2>Germination of light requiring races of Arabidopsis thaliana in the dark after X-irradiation</h2><p>

Since KUGLER (1951) it is known, that the race Hm (Hann.Munden) of A.
thaliana has obligate light requirement for germination.  But it was
demonstrated (REINHOLZ, 1967) that gibberellic acid can substitute for
the light during germination: Unirradiated seeds and such irradiated
in an air-dried state with doses between 100 and 800 kR fully
germinated in a few days.<p>

Table 1: Germination of X-irradiated seeds of A. thaliana, race Hm, in
the dark at 20-22*degrees*C after 2 months<p>

In the meantime new data were obtained according to which high doses
of X-rays are also able to influence the light requirement for the
germination of Hm.  As can be seen from Table 1 X-ray doses as high as
1-2 MR are necessary to induce germination in the dark.  This removal
of the germination inhibition by X-irradiation, therefore is different
from the well known stimulation effects of small doses.  The
effectiveness of only very high doses in these experiments seems to
suggest that the obligate light germination might be related to a
destruction of certain molecules.  It is easily conceivable that
inhibiting substances, or their precursors, or enzymes catalyzing the
formation of such products, have to be inactivated before germination
can sgart.  Another hypothesis to explain the observed germination in
the dark after X-irradiation would be that the X-rays injure the
cellular membranes leading the difusable inhibitors to a more rapid
leaching out during the initial soaking phase.<p>

The problem of the influence of X-rays on the obligate light
requirement for germination has been investigated previously.  Already
1947 REINHOLZ tried to replace the visible light by an X-ray treatment
of presoaked seeds of Arabidopsis, but in vain.  Also DEVI, PRASAD and
RILEY (1964) found no effect on the light requirement of germination
in any of the irradiated seeds of A. thaliana, race Estland. The
present data explain why the earlier investigations were not
successful: The applied doses were too low and the observation period
was too short; the effect is established not earlier than the fifth
day of germination and only after doses on air-dried seeds as high as
1 MR.<p>

Under such conditions the Arabidopsis race Estland (Est-1) out of
LAIBACH's sortiment revealed a quite analogous germination behaviour
as the race Hm, as shown in Table 2.<p>
