INTRODUCTION<p>

Direct determination of carcinogenicity by mammalian or other whole
animal assays is generally too expensive and too long in duration.
Therefore, there is a great need for the rapid screening and
identification of possible carcinogenic properties of chemicals which
are introduced into the market at a rate of 700 to 1000 annually. The
total number of chemicals currently in commercial or laboratory use
had been estimated to be about 70.000 (Garfield, 1982).<p>

In 1976, the British Medical Research Council initiated a program for
testing the reliability of the short-term indirect assays for the
screening of carcinogenic chemicals. Although, about a hundred
different assay systems have been developed for the rapid, indirect
identification of carcinogens (Hollstein et al., 1979; Stich and San,
1981), only the most promising procedures were involved in an
international program, supported also by the United States National
Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, the United States
Environmental Protection Agency, and the National Cancer Center
Research Institute of Japan. Altogether 64 laboratories participated
in the program, involving research workers of several other countries.<p>

The assays used in this study can be grouped in four major classes:
(i) prokaryotic repair, (ii) bacterial mutation, (iii) in vitro
eukaryotic systems, and (iv) and whole animal assays of higher
organisms. Some of the well-established testing systems, such as the
Ames procedure, were employed by several laboratories.<p>

The chemicals were selected by expert panels on the basis of proven
carcinogenicity in animals, and on the basis of theoretical
considerations. Some of the chemicals were paired, i.e., for a number
of known carcinogens structurally similar, but presumably
noncarcinogenic analogs were also selected in order to ascertain the
discriminating power of the assays. The array of the 42 compounds
included also a number of compounds which were believed to be
noncarcinogens on the basis of the best information available. No
single assay system provided entirely satisfactory results, although a
wealth of useful data was obtained (De Serres and Ashby, 1981).<p>

We have tested with Arabidopsis most of the compounds and the summary
of the tests is provided below.<p>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<p>

The Columbia wild type of Arabidopsis was used for all the tests. The
seed was imbibed in water at about 24*degrees*C for 24 hours, and
immediately after, the dissolved chemicals were applied to the seeds
for 15 hours and at the same temperature. The solvent was either E
mineral solution (Redei, 1965) or dimethylsulfoxide. Generally, the
chemicals were tested in six different concentrations. The treatment
was followed by washing in running water for four hours before
planting. The mutational events were scored in about 200 plants on the
basis of pale or white embryos within two fruits on the opposite side
of the stem. The chemicals were considered mutagenic when at least at
two concentrations the frequency of the mutational events exceeded
that of the concurrent control. Details of the procedure were reported
earlier (Acedo et al., 1981; Redei, 1981).<p>

RESULTS<p>

Our findings are condensed in Table 1. Of the 32 compounds
satisfactorily tested with Arabidopsis, 20 was supposed to be
carcinogenic. Actually, 18/20 proved to be mutagenic for Arabidopsis.
If we define 'sensitivity' of our indirect carcinogen assay as the
number of compounds identified as mutagenic among the total number of
carcinogens tested, the 'sensitivity' of Arabidopsis becomes 18/20,
i.e., 0.90. This high sensitivity compares favorably with the results
of an earlier survey of mutagenicity/carcinogenicity tests with
Arabidopsis (Redei et al., 1980) where an 88% was found on the basis
of 56 compounds.<p>

Table 1: The list of chemicals involved in the international project,
carcinogenicity information (+ = carcinogen, - = noncarcinogen), and
the classification of the results by the Arabidopsis assay (filled
circles = mutagenic, open circles = nonmutagenic, ? = inconclusive
data, NT = not tested).<p>

We have tested also 12 presumably noncarcinogenic compounds but only 4
of them appeared to be nonmutagenic in our system. If we define
'specificity' of our assay as number of compounds identified as
nonmutagen among all the noncarcinogens tested, the 'specificity' of
our system based on these set of data becomes 4/12, i.e., 0.33.<p>

Accordingly, 22/23 compounds, involved in our tests, were correctly
identified by the Arabidopsis assay if the original information
regarding carcinogenicity of these chemicals is valid. If we define
'accuracy' of this short term test of carcinogens as the number of
correct identifications among all the tests performed; the 'accuracy'
of our results becomes 22/32, i.e., 0.69.<p>

The accuracy of the pooled data of all systems of testing involved in
this study was 60.8% and that of the best type of tests, the bacterial
mutation assays, was 62.1%.<p>

CONCLUSIONS<p>

The results of this comparative study of short-term carcinogen test
systems confirmed the usefulness of Arabidopsis for identifying
carcinogens on the basis of mutagenesis. It was actually somewhat
surprising that the Arabidopsis assay had higher sensitivity than any
other test system involved in this comparison. The specificity of
Arabidopsis appeared, however, somewhat low, but this can be
attributed to the fact that many of the presumable "non-carcinogens"
are apparently mutagens (and possible carcinogens) but they can be
identified as such only after activation. Thus, it appears that the
seed of Arabidopsis has a very efficient complex of activating
enzymes.<p>
