Estimates of rates of outcrossing Arabidopsis thaliana suggest that
outcrossing in the species normally ranges from approximately 1-2%
(Snape and Lawrence, 1971; Robbelen, 1971). However, under conditions
of high pollinator activity and/or in mutant lines showing varying
degrees of male sterility, rates of outcrossing can rise to 6-26%
(Cetl and Plocha, 1975; Trnena et al., 1987; Drescher and Kranz,
1987). All estimates of outcrossing so far reported have been based on
studies of artificial populations constructed from mutant lines.
However, there is indirect evidence that outcrossing is also rare in
natural populations of A. thaliana; this comes from a recent
electrophoretic survey of genotypic diversity for 9 enzyme systems (13
loci) in 16 British populations of the species (Gomes and Abbott,
1987). Of 480 individual plants examined only two proved to be
heterozygous. Each of these came from a single population (G2) in
Scotland and were heterozygous for alleles at the AP1 locus which
codes for fast, intermediate and slow variants of acid phosphatase
isozymes. The same two individuals were homozygous at five other loci
that were polymorphic in the G2 population.<p>

The electrophoretic survey conducted by Gomes and Abbott (1987) showed
that a locus coding for fast (F) and slow (S) allozymes of peroxidase
(PER) was polymorphic in most populations surveyed (12 out of 16).
This locus has subsequently been used as a marker locus for the
estimation of outcrossing rate in seven British populations in which
F/F and S.S homozygotes of PER were at relative intermediate
frequencies (Table 1).<p>

outcrossing rate t u (95% probability) at the PER locus in seven
populations.<p>

Ten progeny from each of 30 plants per population were classified
according to genotype at the PER locus using the electrophoretic
procedures described in Gomes and Abbott (1987). Progenies were raised
from seed collected from parents that had flowered and set seed in the
wild. Each parent was homozygous either for the F or S allele at the
PER locus. Out of a total of 2,100 progeny from 210 maternal plants
tested, not one was found to be heterozygous. This means that the
estimated rate of outcrossing t^ in each population equals zero.
Although it is not possible to calculate interval etimates of t^ as
the variance of t is also zero, a 95% upper limit of t^, t^u can be
calculated for each population following a procedure described in
detail by Adams and Allard (1982). Using this procedure the upper
limit of outcrossing rate, t^u, over the seven populations was found to
range from 2.00-4.32% (Table 1), which is of a similar order to rates
of outcrossing recorded previously in artificial populations (Snape
and Lawrence, 1971). However, because of a single outcross was
detected in any of the seven populations examined, actual outcrossing
(t) in natural populations may be considerbly lower than is indicated
by t^u Following Adams and Allard (1982), a joint t^u was calculated
from the combined data based on the assumption that t is at a
uniformly low value in each of the seven populations surveyed. The
joint value of t^u equals 0.285% which lies within the range of
outcrossing rates (0-0.53%) which Relichova (1978) recorded for
artificial populations raised under laboratory conditions.<p>

The results of the present study indicate that rates of outcrossing in
natural British populations of A. thaliana are extremely low perhaps
even lower than recorded previously in artificial populations raised
outside. The fact that some outcrossing occurs occasionally in these
populations is evidenced by the occurence of two hetrozygotes at the
AP1 locus among 30 individuals sampled from one Scotish population, G2
(Gomes and Abbott, 1987). In view of the history of outcrossing in the
G2 populations (i.e., at the AP1 locus), this population was subjected
to an additional screen for heterozygotes at the AP1 locus by
examining 10 progeny from each of 12 F/F, 3 I/I and 13 S/S - AP1
parents. In keeping with the results for the PER locus there was no
evidence of outcrossing occuring at the AP1 locus in the G2 population
at least in the year that the progenies tested had been produced.
Taken overall, we may conclude that outcrossing must occur in some
years in some natural populations in Britain, however, in general, the
rate of outcrossing in such populations is usually very low. Despite
the low levels of outcrossing, significant amounts of electrophoretic
variation are found within and between populations in Britain (Gomes
and Abbott, 1987).<p>
