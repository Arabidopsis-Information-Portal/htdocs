Dry seeds (ds) of Arabidopsis thaliana were soaked for 18 h at
24*degrees*C in 3,2 x 10-3 M BUdR.  The frequency of recessive lethals
was determined by the embryo test (cf. MULLER 1963, 1964).  In each M1
plant 150 embryos in five successive pods of the main inflorescence
were tested.  No increase of mutation frequency could be found (see
Table 2).<p>

In other experiments germinating seeds and seedlings (6) were treated.
The seeds were placed in petri dishes on filter paper, soaked with
aqueous solutions of BUdR or IUdR of various concentrations.  The
solutions were changed daily. After 2 days the seeds germinated, after
7 days the seedlings were planted in soil.  In Table 1 some data on
growth inhibition after these treatments are summarized.  The
frequency of recessive lethals did in no case significantly exceed the
spontaneous mutation frequency (Table 2).  Even for IUdR 10-6 M (mc =
0,75 per cent) a P-value of 0,05 was calculated.  All mutants detected
in the treated series were embryonic lethals, whereas in the control 5
pod progenies with chlorophyll mutants (mb = 0, 13, mc = 0,03 percent)
were found.<p>

Since BUdR and IUdR are known to be incorporated into the DNA of
higher plants these results may be interesting in two ways: 1) the
base analogue have not reached the shoot meristem, or 2) the
incorporation does not induce a significant increase of the frequency
of recessive lethals (the test does, of course, not exclude that other
mutation types are induced in higher plants).  Further experiments
allowing a decision between these two alternatives would be of great
interest.<p>
