ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS


1.  ORIGINAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS FOR PRINTED VERSION 1.0 *  Many thanks 
to everyone who sent in protocols and thus made the production of this 
manual possible.  It is difficult to single out individuals from all those 
who have helped with contributions, but special thanks to: Jonathan Clarke 
for supplying on disc many of the protocols used in Molecular Genetics; Ian 
Furner for being such a staunch supplier of protocols from the start of the 
scheme;  Mary Anderson for advice on the DNA and RNA sections; and Clare 
Lister for advice on the DNA section.

*  On the production side, many thanks to:  Barrie Allen for offset-litho 
printing of the covers, spines and page-footer logos; Jonathan Clarke for 
photocopying and collating the final product as well as assembling the 
binders; Mary Anderson for proof-reading; Paul Linstead and Keith Roberts 
for the negative of Calcofluor stained Arabidopsis stem-section used on 
the front cover and Andy Davis for reverse printing of the image.


2.  FINE PRINT *  Please note that the protocols in this manual are 
designed for work on Arabidopsis only.  Furthermore, we cannot guarantee 
that any of the protocols will work.  In other words, do everything at your 
own risk.  If your plants die or you lose your DNA, don't blame us.  *  
Except where copyright already exists, the protocols in both the hard-copy 
and electronic version of this manual, Arabidopsis: The Compleat Guide, 
are copyright.


3.  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS FOR ORIGINAL ELECTRONIC (GOPHER) VERSION *  Many thanks to Sam 
Cartinhour for first suggesting the provision of an electronic version of 
Arabidopsis: The Compleat Guide and for advice on converting it to text-
only and for then helping to turn that into a Gopher/WAIS facility.  Thanks 
also to Sam, Mike Cherry and Howard Goodman for including it as part of 
MGH's AAtDB Research Companion.
