	In contrast to the results of MICHAELIS (1958) in Epilobium and ROBBELEN (1962) in Arabidopsis thaliana, we could get no plastomic mutants in Oenothera by ionizing radiation and mutagenic agents.  We therefore intended to repeat the experiements of ROBBELEN with Arabidopsis thaliana.  Presoaked seed was irradiated with different doses of X-rays.  Among the brought up plants a high percentage of spotted ones could be found.  The leaves of these spotted plants were fixed according to ROBBELEN.  Frozen sections were made and stained with Rhodamin B.  On the limit between white and green regions, in some cases calls were found which can be declared as "mixed cells".  Full account will be given as soon as the total of the fixed material is worked up.<p>
