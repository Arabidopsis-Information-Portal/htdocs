Full Description:
A postdoctoral position is immediately available in the laboratory of
Ravi Palanivelu at the University of Arizona, Tucson.  The successful
candidate will be undertaking a multidisciplinary approach-Genetics,
Cell biology and Biochemistry to conduct independent research to
isolate and characterize guidance signals generated by Arabidopsis
thaliana pistils to guide pollen tubes to their final target and affect
fertilization (Palanivelu et al, 2003, Cell. 114:47-59 and Palanivelu
and Preuss, 2000, Trends in Cell Biology, 10:517-524).  Candidates must
have a strong background in molecular genetics, cell biology and/or
biochemistry, carry out outstanding research, should be highly
motivated, demonstrate willingness to interact with other research team
members, and possess excellent writing and speaking skills.  Previous
experience with Arabidopsis is desirable but not essential.
