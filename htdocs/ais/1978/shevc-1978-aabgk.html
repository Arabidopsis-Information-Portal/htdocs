Embryo development abnormalities after gamma-irradiation of
Arabidopsis thaliana buds, flowers and young pods were studied. A.
thaliana plants (race En) were grown in test tubes on minimal agar
medium under continuous illumination at 24 +/- 1*degree*C. During the
anthesis phases of flower development were determined visually and
then half of the test tubes were irradiated with 4kr gamma-rays, the
other half being the control ones. Phases were designated using
Muller's terminology (1961): B3-meiosis, B'4-embryo sac,
B"4-fertilization, B5-in most ovules apical cell of embryo divided 1-3
times, B6-early globular stage, B7-medium and full globular stage.<p>

The inflorences were fixed in the mixture of 100 ml 70% ethyl alcohol,
7 ml acetic acid and 7 ml formalin in 24, 36 and 48 hours after
irradiation. The flowers were sectioned at 10 micro and stained with
Gentian violet, then counterstained with Orange G in caryophyllus oil.
All in all 250 flowers and 2611 embryos were analysed. Cotyledon
abnormalities were determined in seedlings grown during 7 days on
minimal agar medium in Petri dishes. In total 6906 seedlings were
scored.<p>

A cytological study showed that the rate of embryo development both in
the control and the irradiated material during 2 days after the
exposure was approximately the same. However, irradition induced a
number of abnoramlities of embryo development which we divided into 4
types:<p>

1. The first transverse division of the apical cell of embryo instead
of the longitudinal one (Figure 1). It was observed after irradiation
of the flowers at B4 (11.9 +/- 2.88%) and B5 (20.0+/- 4.10%) phases.<p>

number and shape of cotyledons after irradiation of flowers at
different phases of development.<p>

2. Anomalous pattern of suspensor cell divisions after irradiation of
the flowers at B4 (o.3 +/- 3.07%, B4- 2.9 +/- 1.16%, B5- 2.0 +/-
0.48%).<p>

3. A lag of the apical cell division while suspensor cells divided in
a usual way (B3- 3.1 +/- 3.07%, B4- 2.9 +/- 1.16%, B5-2.0 +/- 0.48%).<p>

4. Disturbances in the cleavage pattern of upper or lower tier of
embryo, wrong embryo outline, observed in globular embryos (B4- 1.5
+/- 1.06%, B5- 2.4 +/- 0.69%, B6- 2.2 +/- 1.30%).<p>

Gerlach-Cruse (1969) observed disturbances in cell wall formation of
suspensor cells and abnormalities in the globular embryo after
fertilization of irradiated ovules with nonirradiated pollen.
Abnormalities of the cotyledon number and shape were found after
irradiation during all phases of flower development (Table 1). Maximum
of such abnormalities was observed at B5 - B7 phases. Reinholz (1959)
investigated the same irregularity. In our experiments at B4 - B5
phases monocotyledonous and at B6 - B7 phases tricolyledonous
seedlings were predominant among anomalous ones.<p>

Abnormalities of the embryo development found in these experiments can
be helpful for understanding the causes of the early ovule death after
irradiation.<p>
