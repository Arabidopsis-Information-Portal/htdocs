The nutritional requirements of several lethal chlorophyll mutants
were studied, using sterile cultures under continuous illumination.
Among 39 different mutants tested, seven of the chlorina type reverted
to the normal phenotype on a minimal agar-medium containing 2%
glucose.  There were some slight differences in the speed of
normalisation among these mutants, but they all reached normal or
nearly normal phenotype at the 4.-5. leaf-pair stage.  On all other
media, either minimal or maximal according to JACOBS (1964) but
without glucose, all these mutants died without any change of
phenotype.  The rest of the examined mutants (12 chlorina, 15 xantha
and 4 albina) was able to grow and develop rosettes on the minimal
medium + 2% glucose without any increase of the pigment content.  No
requirement for other substances like amino acids, vitamins, purines
and pyrimidines were detected among all the mutants tested.
Principally the same effect as that of glucose was observed by the
authors and by SCHROBSDORFF and ROBBELEN (unpubl.) with sacharose.<p>

It seems, that for a part of lethal chlorina, which on the minimal
medium or in the soil are able to synthetize only small quantities of
chloroplasts pigments and later get bleached and die, only a source of
energy supply suffices for their normalisation.  Nevertheless it
remains to be answered, whether the blocks in these mutants concern
functions associated with photosynthesis only, as presumed by WALLES
(1963), or whether the supplied energy is consumed directly for the
chlorophyll- protein complex, etc.<p>
