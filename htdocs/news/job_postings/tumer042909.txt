Postdoctoral Position at Rutgers University 
 
A postdoctoral position is available at the Biotech Center at Rutgers University in the laboratory of 
Dr. Nilgun E. Tumer to investigate the mechanisms of uptake, transport and cytotoxicity of ricin 
and Shiga-like toxins. The Tumer lab works on elucidating the basic mechanisms of action of ricin 
and Shiga-like toxins using Saccharomyces cerevisae and C. elegans as model systems 
(Biochemistry 2009, in press; Mol Microbiol. 2008, 70:1441; J. Biol. Chem. 2008, 283:6145). 
 Both toxins depurinate the sarcin/ricin loop of the large rRNA and inhibit translation.  Our goal is 
to identify the targets of these toxins to understand the mechanism by which they cause ribotoxic 
stress and cell death.  The successful candidate will use genetic and cell biology approaches to 
investigate the mechanism of uptake and transport of the toxins in yeast and C. elegans and use 
chemical genomics approaches to identify the cellular pathways affected by these toxins.  The 
ideal candidate should have a Ph.D. in a related field, experience with yeast and/or C.elegans 
genetics and cell biology and familiarity with chemical biology and bioinformatics.  The Biotech 
Center is located in New Brunswick, New Jersey near New York City and Philadelphia and is 
equipped with state-of-the-art facilities and instrumentation.  Rutgers University is an Equal 
Opportunity/Affirmative Action employer.
