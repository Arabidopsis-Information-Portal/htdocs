METHODS AND RESULTS<p>

Results described here were obtained by incubating groups of 100
axenic dry seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana for 3 days with 500 micro
g/ml .01 M NaCl solutions of E. coli plasmids. Sterility was checked
at the end of the incubation period (on different solid growth media)
and seedlings were sown on sterile agar culture medium, in test tubes
(Ledoux et al., 1971). This method was chosen because no DNAse
activity is observed during the first 3 days of germination, while
large amounts of DNA are taken up by plant tissues. This "poration"
phenomenon ceases afterwards, when hydration and semipermeability are
complete.<p>

The more interesting plasmids used so far belong to the pBR series,
among which the much used pBR325 codes for resistance to ampicilline
(Amp), chloramphenicaol (Cm) and tetracycline (Tet) (Figure 1). Plants
are insensitive to ampicilline. They are however sensitive to 10 E-4M
Cm or Tet.<p>

Among Arabidopsis seedlings treated with pBR325, no resistance towards
Tet and a very faint resistance towards Cm could be detected (31%
survival instread of 12%). However, no significant production of
chloramphenicol acetyl transferase could be found with the method of
Herrera-Estrella et al. (1983a).<p>

Chromatography on Sephadex G75 of plant extracts precipitated with
ammonium sulphate between 45 and 85% saturation. V.V. = void volume.<p>

Some treated plants flowered and set fruits. They also developed
abnormalities and teratomas (absent from control grown on Cm). This
was the phenotype we selected, and seeds obtain from these plants were
sown on medium without Cm leading to normal F 1 plants from which
several progenies were derived and grown on normal media. In all
cases, the sterility of the plant tissues was ascertained after
homogenization under sterile conditions in phosphate buffer, pH 7.0.<p>

The presence of *beta*-lactamase in the treated plants was determined
in the following manner (Ledoux et al., 1982): plants were homogenized
in micro Potter tubes, in the presence of 0.2M Na phosphate + 0.25%
Triton X-100, pH 6.8. Extracts were precipitated with ammonium
sulphate between 45 and 85% saturation (these precipitates contained
9% of the total TCA precipitable protein of the plants) and dissolved
in 0.2 M Na phosphate. pH 6.8. The degradation of 10E-4 M nitrocefin
(O'Callaghan et al., 1972) at 30*degrees* was followed at 390 and 490
nm. The variation with time of differences of optical densities at
these wavelengths was used as a measure of the *beta*-lactasmase
activity.<p>

A significant enzyme activity was found in treated plants (Table 1)
and could be inhibited (by 85-90%) with an antiserum obtained by
injecting pBR induced *beta*-lactamase into a rabbit and precipitating
the serum with ammonium sulphate. The enzyme activity found in treated
plants was not affected by preimmune serum. It was also inactivated by
clavulanic acid or cefoxitin (3), two specific inhibitors of plasmid
induced *beta*-lactamases. The faint activity found in controls was
not modified by the antiserum, the preimmune serum nor the specific
inhibitors of *beta*-lactamases. The faint activity found in controls
was not modified by the antiserum, the preimmune serum nor the
specific inhibitors of *beta*-lactamase.<p>

The total activity recovered in plants varied with age of the plant
and its state of development. Absent during the first week, it
appeared and increased during the vegetative growth, then remained
constant during flowering. This was true for treated populations
(grown with or without Cm) as well as for F 1, F 2, or F 3 progenies
grown in the absence of Cm.<p>

Table 1: *beta*-lactamase activity found in treated Arabidopsis plants
(2 weeks old) per gram plant TCA-precipitable protein.<p>

In situ hybridizations with [3 H] pBR325 probes showed that almost
every cell present in the treated embryos contained pBR325 after the 3
days incubation time. No significant labelling was found in controls
(Maluszinski et al., 1982). In treated plants, pBR sequences were
found concentrated in nuclei and could be observed during the entire
growth period (4). Six different pBR derivatives bearing fragments of
Arabidopsis ribosomal DNA and one derivative bearing an autonomous
replication sequence (ARS) from Arabidopsis, inserted in the Tet R
region showed no real advantage for *beta*-lactamase expression in
plants (Table 1). On the other hand, among 7 plasmids of different
origins (Renauld et al., 1984), all bearing the same Amp R region in
different nucleotide context, only two led to a production of
*beta*-lactamase (Table 1). Insertion or deletion in the Amp R region
led to the absence of *beta*-lactamase activity in treated plants, as
did the linearization of the pBR plasmids: they had to be circular to
be effective.<p>

The *beta*-lactamase produced by the plants was analysed by
chromatography on Sephadex G75. The enzyme found had a M.W. of about
70.000, in comparison to the 27.000 D of the bacterial enzyme (Figure
2). The possibility that this could be due to a binding of a 27.000 D
polypeptide to some plant material was ruled out by SDS-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) in reducing conditions (samples in 1 M
2*beta*-mercaptoethanol). After blotting on nitrocellulose, treating
with antiserum, then with 125 I labelled protein A, an specific spot
was found in the extracts of the treated plant (and not in controls)
corresponding to 70-90.000 D (Figure 3). When preimmune serum was used
after blotting, this spot did not appear.<p>

Our working hypothesis was that the *beta*-lactamase found in plants
corresponded to a fused protein due to the integration of the ApR gene
into the plant genome possibly placing the bactrial gene under the
control of a plant regulatory gene or promotor activated during the
leave growth period (Charles et al., 1982).<p>

of reduced plant extracts, proteins were electrotransferred to a
nitrocellulose membrane and treated with anti *beta*-lactamase serum,
then with 125 I protein A. An autoradiography is shown here. 1: pBR325
treated plants. 2: control plants. 3: *beta*-lactamase. 4: control
plants + *beta*-lactamase.<p>

To check this, calluses were derived from F 2 seeds and subcultured
monthly during two years. By this way, amounts of material sufficient
for biochemical analysis could be obtained from individual seedlings.
A continuous *beta*-lactamase production was observed in a large
proportion of the F 2 populations (60% of the calluses studied) and
callus lines with permanent high levels of enzyme activity could be
isolated. In other cases, the original levels of enzyme activity
decreased and sometimes vanished after several subcultures.
Chromatography on Sephadex G75 showed that the enzyme found in
calluses had the high M.W. previously observed.<p>

Cytochrome C was added as a M.W. coloured marker. Fractions were
spotted on nitrocellulose after determination of absorbance. The
spotted fractions were treated with anti-hGH antiserum then with 125 I
protein A. After autoradiography, spots were photodensitometerized to
measure the radioactivity.<p>

DNA isolated from these calluses were analysed by Southern blotting
and hybridization following Chomczynski and Qasba (1984), with a 32
P-labelled pB3255 probe. Results obtained with or without 5 different
restriction enzymes showed the presence of pBR sequences in the plant
genome. These sequences were released upon restriction of the plant
DNA (Figure 4). Three calluses obtained from the same F2 progeny
displayed similar patterns of integration. No homology between pBR and
the DNA extracted from control calluses could be found in the
stringent conditions we used. The analysis of the results indicated
that the integrated pBR sequence (about 2/3 of the plasmid molecule
contained at least the Amp R region. It apparently occupied a well
defined site in the DNA genome; it had resisted 2 meioses and 2 years
of vegetative callus growth under non-selective conditions.<p>

On the basis of these results, attempts were made to obtain kanamycin
resistant calluses from seeds treated with different plasmids bearing
the kan R gene under the control of the nopaline synthetase promoter
(Herrera-Estrella et al., 1983b). Six plasmids were used, without
success. We then used a pBR322 derivative (pChGH800), bearing the cDNA
corresponding to the human growth hormone (hGH) inserted in the Tet R
region. This plasmid does not, as such, express hGH in bacteria
(Martial et al., 1979); it contains the coding sequence for the poly
dA tail characteristic of eukaryotic mRNA. Calluses were directly
grown from treated seeds. The presence of the hormone (protein of
about 22.000 D) was checked with a radio-immunoassay measuring ng
amounts. Calluses developed from plasmid-treated seeds were strongly
positive. Little or no activity was detected in control calluses.
Extracts precipitated between 25 and 60% saturation in ammonium
sulphate were analysed by chromatography on Sephadex G75. Each
fraction was tested for the presence of material reacting with the
anti hGH serum following the sequence: antiserum, [125 I] protein A,
radioautography, photodensitometry (Figure 5). From the distributions
obtained, the molecular weight of the induced antigen was found
similar to that of the hGH itself. In three separate callus lines,
similar levels of production were observed: +/-0.15 mg hGH per gram
total TCA precipitable callus protein. No activity was found in
several extracts of control calluses, also purified by chromatography.<p>

CONCLUSION AND SUMMARY<p>

The calluses derived from plasmid-treated seeds produced high
molecular *beta*-lactamase as found earlier with pBR325.<p>

The chemical structures of the bacterial or human proteins produced by
the treated plants are presently being studied.<p>

To summarize, treating germinating seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana with
E. coli plasmids can lead to plants or calluses producing proteins
coded by the plasmid DNA. From the treated plants, progenies can be
obtained where foreign DNA remains integrated in specific sites of the
genome.<p>
