Postdoctoral position in Arabidopsis energy signaling 
 
One post-doctoral position is immediately available in the Plant Stress Signaling group at the 
Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência located near Lisbon, Portugal (http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt). The 
position is initially for one year but renewable up to two. 
 
Research in the lab focuses on energy signaling and its connection to environmental changes and 
growth. The Arabidopsis SnRK1 protein kinases play a central role during the stress response and 
are required for the proper integration of environmental cues into growth and development. 
Sensing and signaling stress-associated energy deprivation, SnRK1s trigger global gene expression 
reprogramming, enabling the adjustment of energy homeostasis necessary for coping with stress. 
The present project aims at further dissecting and understanding SnRK1-mediated signaling 
through the elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms associated with SnRK1 nuclear localization, 
post-translational modifications, and modulation by upstream phosphatases.  
 
Applicants should have a PhD in genetics, biochemistry or molecular biology, with excellent 
communication skills and a strong background in molecular biology and biochemistry. Experience 
in Arabidopsis signaling and traditional biochemistry techniques (recombinant protein 
production, immunoprecipitation, protein complex isolation and/or cell fractionation) is a plus. 
Interested candidates should send CV, a letter of motivation with a brief description of previous 
research, and three letters of reference to ebaena@igc.gulbenkian.pt
