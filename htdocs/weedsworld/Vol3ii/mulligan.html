After the books, the film, <I>Arabidopsis</I> as a model organism is one of
six videos in the Model Organism series, the other focussing on the mouse,
<I>Drosophila</I>, <I>C.elegans</I>, yeast and the phage lambda. The aim behind the series
is to, &quot;make the process of learning cutting-edge science a pleasure&quot;,
for students and professional scientists alike.<p>
The video begins with a brief survey of the importance of plants to mankind.
Then, Elliot Meyerowitz presents the case for <I>Arabidopsis</I>, focussing on
a genetic dissection of floral development as a text book example of the
advantages of using model systems in developmental biology.<p>
After a summary of the characteristic features of <I>Arabidopsis</I>, the discussion
turns to the flower as a subject for study. The anatomy of <I>Arabidopsis</I> flowers
is described in sufficient detail to set the scene for a more extensive
examination of the role of homeotic genes in floral organ development. 
The procedures of seed mutagenesis are described in some detail, the importance
of &quot;knowing the organism&quot; in order to detect mutant phenotypes
is emphasised and the different phenotypes of the different classes of floral
mutants are nicely illustrated. Then a model of floral development is proposed
in which three classes of homeotic genes interact in the organ whorls.
The hypothesis or the ABC model is then tested and confirmed by the construction
of double mutants with predicted phenotypes. Approaches to gene cloning
procedures and <I>Arabidopsis</I> transformation by vacuum infiltration are briefly
described. Where to go next, what are the next questions to ask are discussed.<p>
Finally, Chris Somerville and Fred Ausubel illustrate the biotechnological
applications of <I>Arabidopsis</I> research using as examples, the production of
biodegradable plastics in plants and the cloning of disease resistance genes.<p>
The information is presented at about the right pace for a well informed
science student, though the sections on the construction and testing of
the model of floral development would require several viewings by the non-expert
in order to digest all the relevant detail provided.<p>
In different contexts the video would be valuable for teaching genetics/plant
biology students from first year undergraduates to first year postgraduates. It would also be a useful stimulus to broader discussion. The illustrations (moving and still) are very good.<p>
<I>Arabidopsis</I> as a Model organsim can be highly recommended.
