Abscisic acid (ABA) - a naturally occurring plant hormone - now ranks
in importance with auxins, gibberellins, and cytokinins as a plant
growth controlling factor (ADDICOTT and LYON, 1969).  Its role in (a)
acceleration of abscission in fruits and leaves, (b) induction and
prolongation of dormancy in shoots of deciduous trees and in tubers,
(c) inhibition of germination, (d) inhibition of flowering of long day
plants held under short days, as also in the senescence of leaves, now
appear to be almost established (EL ENTABLY et al., 1967; SANKHLA and
SANKHLA, 1968a, b, c, d; ADDICOTT and LYON, 1969).  We observed that
ABA greatly enhanced the chlorophyll degradation of excised leaf discs
of Arabidopsis, and thus effect was reversed if cytokines were added
simultaneously (SANKHLA and SANKHLA, 1968a).  The present report
summarizes our observations relating to the effect of kinetin and ABA,
alone and in combination, on degradation of proteins and incorporation
of leucine and uracil in the senescing leaf discs of Arabidopsis.<p>

The leaf discs were prepared for experimentation in the same way as
described earlier (SANKHLA, 1970); the protein content was measured
periodically by a modified biuret method.  Radioactivity was estimated
with the help of a Packard's liquid scintillation spectrophotometer
after appropriate incubation of the leaf discs.<p>

The results in the table clearly indicate that ABA drastically
affected the maintenance of protein content; as a result ABA treated
leaf discs lost as much as 95% of their protein after 48 hrs.  In
contrast, kinetin greatly delayed the disorganization of the proteins.
Kinetin also checked the disintegration of protein resulting from ABA
action.  These findings were found to be supported by incorporation
studies.  Kinetin stimulated incorporation of 14C-leucine into
proteins, while ABA appreciably reduced it.  When applied with ABA,
kinetin appreciably restored the incorporation of leucine into
proteins.  ABA also decreased the incorporation of 3H-uracil into RNA,
but kinetin slightly enhanced it.  Thus it is clear that kinetin not
only delayed the decrease in RNA content, but also maintained the
protein content in the leaf discs.  In this respect the response of
Arabidopsis leaf discs to kinetin treatment appears to be similar to
that exhibited by other species to auxins, gibberellin, and kinetin
(OSBORNE, 1967).<p>

ABA has been reported to block the synthesis of specific DNA's (VAN
OVERBEEK et al., 1967).  Although this report yet remains to be
confirmed, several investigators believe that ABA certainly inhibits
RNA synthesis.  Treatment of leaf discs with ABA led to a marked
reduction of RNA, the reduction of polyribosomes fraction was
particularly rapid (WAREING, GOOD and MANUEL, 1969).  In leaf discs of
Xanthium, ABA prevented the incorporation of 14C-leucine into protein
(OSBORNE, 1967).  In embryos of Fraxinus, ABA inhibited the
incorporation of 3H-leucine.  It was concluded that ABA maintains
dormancy by inhibiting the production of specific types of mRNA and,
therefore, the formation of specific proteins (VILLIERS, 1968).  In
Arabidopsis, ABA induced inhibition of chlorophyll, proteins and RNA
(SANKHLA and SANKHLA, 1968a; SANKHLA, 1970) could be restored by
kinetin.  Also gibberellin reversed the senescence promoting effect of
ABA (SANKHLA, 1970). Since many of the effects of ABA are in
opposition to the growth promoting hormones, auxins, GA and
cytokinins, it would appear possible that ABA-like substances have an
important role in the homeostasis of the plants (ADDICOTT and LYON,
1969).<p>
