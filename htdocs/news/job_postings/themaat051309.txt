Bioinformatician 
Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research 
Division: The Max Planck Institute in Plant Breeding (MPIZ) (http://www.mpiz-koeln.mpg.de/) is 
one of the world’s premier sites committed to research into fundamental processes and training in 
plant biology. There are four science departments, three independent research groups and 
specialist support, totaling ~ 400 staff including externally funded positions. 
 
Time frame 
The position will be for two years with the possibility for extension. 
 
Job destcription 
       The successful applicant will be expected to interact closely with departmental project 
leaders. Applicants will provide bioinformatics expertise to identify on a global scale functionally 
important cis-acting DNA motifs, binding sites for DNA transcription factors and chromatin-
associated proteins as well as small RNAs. He/she will join an expanding group of 
bioinformaticians at MPIZ. 
 
Requirements 
       We seek a creative and motivated candidate with a PhD in bioinformatics, informatics, 
statistical physics, computer science or molecular biology. Experience in microarray analysis and 
computational methods to align sequence tags to reference genomes and to analyze 
transcriptional regulatory networks on a genome-wide basis is of advantage but not a 
requirement. 
 
Application 
       Please send your application including CV and name of at least one academic referee 
via e-mail to the Departmental Office to: Jutta Weinand@mpiz-koeln.mpg.de by 19 June 2009 
The Max Planck Society is an equal opportunity employer. 
 
Deadline for applications: June 19th, 2009.
