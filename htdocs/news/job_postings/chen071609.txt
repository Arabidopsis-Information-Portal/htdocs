Postdoctoral Fellow in Computational Biology 
The University of Texas at Austin 
 
We seek a highly motivated scientist to work in a plant molecular genetics and genomics 
laboratory. Our recent work on polyploidy, hybrid vigor, and epigenetics has led to the 
publications in Nature and PNAShttp://polyploidy.biosci.utexas.edu/publications.php. The position 
is available immediately, and salary is competitive with experience. 
 
Successful candidates should have a Ph.D. in Computational Biology, Statistics or Computer 
Science with interest and experience in analyzing genome sequence and gene expression data. 
Training and skills in computer programming (perl/C/C++/shell script/linux), mathematical 
modeling, statistic tests, genome browser, and DNA sequence analysis are desirable. 
 Experience with data structure of plant genomes, microarrays, small RNAs, microRNAs, and 
next-generation sequencing data are helpful. In addition to hypothesis testing using genomic and 
expression data, the postdoctoral fellow will work with a dynamic team of experimental biologists 
to analyze RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and small RNA-seq  data. 
 
The Chen lab http://polyploidy.biosci.utexas.edu/ is located in the section of Molecular Cell and 
Developmental Biology (http://www.biosci.utexas.edu/MCDB/) in the School of Biological 
Sciences (http://www.biosci.utexas.edu/) and the Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology 
(http://www.icmb.utexas.edu/) at The University of Texas at Austin.  There will be excellent 
opportunities for the postdoctoral fellows and graduate students to interact with faculty and 
students within MCDB as well as research groups in the Integrative Biology 
(http://www.biosci.utexas.edu/IB/) and the Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics 
(http://ccbb.biosci.utexas.edu/).  Please visit http://www.utexas.edu for more information about 
the university and living in Austin. 
 
The University of Texas at Austin is an Affirmative Action/Equal Opportunity employer. 
 
Interested candidates should send a statement of career goals and a copy of curriculum vitae 
including names and addresses of three references via email <zjchen@mail.utexas.edu>.
