Nearly all studies on sulphydryl protection against radiation induced
genetic damage in higher plants, focus on chromosomal aberrations
observed in root tips.  Genetic parameters like M2-mutant percentage
were studied by ANDO (1972) who for M2 chlorophyll mutants found no
protective effect when post treating gamma-irradiated rice seeds with
cysteine, and by MALVAREZ et al.  (1965) who for M2 chlorophyll
mutants found with X-irradiated barley seeds no protective effect when
cysteamine was applied as posttreatment, and an increase rather than a
decrease when it was applied as pre treatment.<p>

On the basis of preliminary experience (VAN DER VEEN et al., 1969) we
chose the sulphydryl compound 1, 4-dithiotreitol (DTT), which was
found by BICK and JACKSON (1968) to give a 68% reduction of
chromosomal aberrations of "the two-hit-type" in X-ray treated
marsupial leucocyte cultures. We applied the Arabidopsis embryo-test
on siliquae 4 and 5 of the main stem, and expressed M2-mutant
percentage as percentage of embryonic mutants (embryonic lethals and
chlorophyll's) among fertilized ovules.<p>

Seeds of Landsberg-'erecta' were first kept on wet filterpaper during
5 days at 2*degrees*C (to break dormancy), and redried.  Prior to (4
hrs) and during irradition the seeds were kept submers in water or
DDT-solution (1.2%) at 24*degrees*C, and afterwards they were rinsed
and put to germinate at 24*degrees*C under TL. The seedlings were
transplanted to an air-conditioned greenhouse (22*degrees*C).
X-irradition (200 r/min.) and fast neutron irradition (75 r/min) was
carried out at the ITAL (Wageningen). For replacement of air by
nitrogen, the gas was bubbled (vacuum pump) through the solution as
the beginning of pretreatment.<p>

We had found that post-treatment has no protective effect, and that it
made no difference for the protective effect whether DTT was applied
only before, only during or both before and during irradiation. With
DTT concentrations higher than 1.2% the protective effect was not much
enhanced, whilst toxic effects (germination delay, seedling survival)
became noteworthy.<p>

With respect to the X-ray dose response curve, we found that nitrogen
does not affect the exponential nature of the curve throughout the
dose range, whilst DTT changes the curve towards linearity, which
indicates 1) that DTT preferentially protects against those types of
chromosomal damage which can lead to two-hit events, and 2) that the
effect of DTT is qualitatively different from that of nitrogen, so
that an "additive" effect of DTT and nitrogen might be expected, which
however was not the case as is illustrated by the following data on
mutant % (200 resp. 135 plants scored per item for X-rays resp. FN):<p>

From these data, it is seen that DTT not only gives considerable
protection with both types of irradiation, but also that 1) DTT gives
no extra protection under hypoxia, and 2) DTT alone can give more
protection than nitrogen alone (see fast neutrons).  We therefore
advance as an explanation that DTT is blocked in its action by
hypoxia, i.e., certain metabolic processes may be a prerequisite for
DTT to reach its target site. The complete absence of protection found
at low pH (1.8) points in the same direction.<p>

In addition, our data do not indicate a close connection of DTT
protection with the oxygen effect as 1) with fast neutrons, which are
known to have a comparatively low oxygen effect, protection is as
least as effective as with X-rays (see above), and 2) with the present
semi-anaerobic treatment (seeds submers) protection was found to be no
less than with aerobic treatment (seeds on filterpaper), viz. 7
kR-equivalents at 24 kR in both cases, though with aerobiosis X-ray
damage is about twice as high. Therefore, it is quite well possible
that DTT not so much acts in competition with oxygen or by scavenging
oxygen mediated free radicals, but that it acts mainly through a
direct protective effect in the living cell, i. e., protection of the
nucleo-protein complex or of the DNA repair enzymes (cf. the
discussion on sulfur-containing radioprotectors by BACQ and GOUTIER,
1967).<p>
