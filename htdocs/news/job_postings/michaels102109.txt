Two research associate positions are available to support the Arabidopsis Functional Genomics 
Pipeline (AFGP). The goal of this project is to establish and streamline methodologies for the 
discovery of gene and protein function in the model plant Arabidopsis. Methodologies to be 
employed include, but are not limited to, the manipulation of gene expression, determination of 
subcellular protein localization, and analysis of protein:protein and protein:DNA interactions. One 
year of experience in a molecular biology or biochemistry laboratory is required. Familiarity with 
the following techniques is desirable: yeast-two-hybrid analysis, immunoprecipitation, chromatin 
immunoprecipitation, next-generation sequencing, or microscopy. Prior experience with plants is 
not required. Intellectual curiosity, organizational skills, enthusiasm and self-motivation are 
essential. A bachelor's degree in Biology or a related field is required. Salary will be 
commensurate with education and experience with full benefits included. Interested individuals 
should e-mail a cover letter outlining interests, resume, and contact information for 3 individuals 
willing to supply letters of recommendation, to Dee Verostko dverostk@indiana.eduusing "AFGP 
Research Associate" in the subject line or send materials to 1001 East Third Street, Bloomington, 
IN 47405. Applications will be accepted until a suitable candidate is identified.
