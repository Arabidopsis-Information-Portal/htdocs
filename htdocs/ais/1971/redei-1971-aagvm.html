Earlier surveys of our laboratory (REDEI, 1965; LI, REDEI and GOWANS,
1967) indicated that the spectra of biochemical mutation in green
plants (Arabidopsis, Physcomitrella, Chlamydomonas) is different from
those of bacteria and fungi.  In the latter groups of species
auxotrophic mutants concerned with the biosynthesis of amino acids,
vitamins, purines and pyrmidines can be readily induced.  In green
plants mutants absolutely depending on external supply of the above
mentioned compounds are rare, and resticted to substances synthesized
through relatively few pathways.<p>

Recently CARLSON (1970) obtained seven auxotrophic cultures of callus
in tobacco and all of them were leaky.  Essentially similar was the
observation of WALLES (1963) on the amino acid requiring mutants of
barley.<p>

The difficulty of obtaining obligate auxotrophs in higher plants may
be attributed to several causes.  BRITTEN and KOHNE (1968) postulated
genetic redundancy on the basis of the observation of a high
multiplicity of repeated sequences in the DNA.  The ribosomal RNA
sites of the chromosome of Drosophila indicated well over hundred-fold
redundancy on the basis of nucleic acid hybridization studies
(RITOSSA, ATWOOD, and SPIEGELMAN, 1966).  The widespread occurrence of
isozymes (cf. SHANNON, 1968; SCANDALIOS, 1969) can also be considered
as evidence for genetic redundancy.  Recently ANDERSON and ADVANI
(1970) distinguished by isoelectric focusing three photosynthetic
enzymes from chloroplast and non-particulate cytoplasm, respectively,
in Pisum.<p>

We have isolated in an aqueous medium by differential centrifugation
chloroplasts (2,000 x g, 10 min) and non-particulate cytoplasm
(110,000 x g, 2 hrs) and the ribonucleolytic activity of the two
fractions displayed different pH optima.  The organelle contained
RNase digested yeast RNA best at pH 7.5 and exhibited a sharp optimum,
the RNase of the non-particulate cytoplasm was mot active around pH 6
with no clear optimum (REDEI, 1967).  Recently we isolated
chloroplasts from fresh plant material in pH 5.0 (0.1 M) citrate
buffer containing 0.5 M sucrose and we purified it through density
gradient centrifugation (Sorvall HB 4 roter) (400 x g, 10 min) by
layering it 1.5 M sucrose in citrate buffer (pH 5, 0.1M). Intact
chloroplasts were obtained in a sharp band in the middle of the tube.
Above the sharp green band broken organelles were scattered and below
some clumped chloroplasts and tissue debris could be distinguished.<p>

The "intact" chloroplats were washed three times with sucrose buffer,
then suspended in distilled water, lyophilized, extracted with many
changes of acetone, dried, dialyzed against several changes of
distilled water for 24 hours and after freeze drying a slightly
colored powder was obtained.  Water extracts of this thoroughly ground
material failed to show any detectable phosphomonoesterase activity.
Incorporation of this particulate material into an incubation mixture
containing p-nitrophenyl phosphate displayed high phosphatase
activity.  Some enzyme activity was present also in 0.1 M KCl extracts
of this chloroplast powder.  The pH optimum of the bound enzyme could
not be clearly determined.  Some preparations exhibited maximal
activity at pH 6.0 in others the activity was about identical between
pH 5.0 and pH 6.0<p>

The non-particulate cytoplasm contains readily water-soluble acidic
phosphatase(s) with a pH optimum at 5.6.  The relative activity of
this enzyme shows a sharper decline in the alkaline range than the
chloroplast bound protein.<p>

Thus it appears that Arabidopsis cells compartmentalize at least two
clearly distingishable enzymes which seem to contain smaller variants.
This observation lends additional support to the genetic redundancy
postulated on the basis of the restricted spectrum of obligate
auxotrophic mutations.<p>
