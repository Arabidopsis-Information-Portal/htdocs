In the course of a study on the sensitivity of Arabidopsis seeds, race
Li-2, to fast neutrons the selfed progeny was grown of 125 visibly
aberrant M1 plants which differed significantly from the control in
respect of (a) length of longest leaf at anthesis; (b) number of days
to flowering and (c) number of days from flowering to harvesting.
Twenty five of these M1 plants, which were clearly chimeric, were
represented by 2 - 4 M2 seedlots each.  For all 3 characters the
frequency distributions of the selected M1 plants were skewed towards
the lower values, in contrast to the control those of the original M1
population were much less skewed or not at all.<p>

Fifty seeds were sown per progeny whereas the control consisted of
1500 seeds.  Methods of culturing were described earlier (CONTANT,
1966 a).  Germination was recorded 6, 18, 24, 30, 42 and 54 hours
after sowing. Root length was determined by taking photographs of the
petridishes at 12 hour intervals; the negatives were projected on a
smooth white wall on which the roots were measured with a curvimeter,
which constitutes an improvement over the earlier method (CONTANT,
1966 b).  Furthermore, the following parameters were recorded: (1)
plant diameter at 1 - 1.5 week intervals; (2) number of leaves and
length of the longest leaf at the B6 stage of the first flowers (cf.
MULLER, 1961); (3) the number of days to the B6 stage of the first
flowers (4) segregation of morphological and colour aberrations.
Fertility was only determined on the early flowering individuals.<p>

M2 segregation of non-germinating mutations: Thirty six M2 lines (out
of 150) segregated for germinating and non-germinating seeds, in
frequencies ranging from 1/16 to over 1/2, and consistent with 1/4 in
29 cases.  In 3 out of the 25 visible chimeras there was a significant
difference in germination speed between the progenies of the two plant
parts harvested.<p>

M2 segregation of visible mutations: Forty five progenies segregated
for visible mutations in proportions ranging from less than 1/16 to
over 1/2.  Most did not differ significantly from a 3 : 1 ratio.  Five
types of phenotypic abnormalities occurred in several progenies, in
approximately the same proportion: (a) tiny yellowish plantlet, dying
after 3 - 4 weeks; in 6 M2 lines, in proportions ranging from 0.05 -
0.10; (b) very compact tiny plantlet with darkgreen leaves; in 3 M2
lines, in proportions ranging from 0.04 - 0.08; (c) dark green plant
with small leaves, and short petioles; in 4 M2 lines, in proportions
ranging from 0.17 - 0.30; (d) plant with open growth habit and long
petioles; in 2 M2 lines, in proportions 0.06 and 0.08; (e) plant with
mosaic leaves; in 3 M2 families, in proportions ranging from 0.04 -
0.07 (another mosaic, occurring in part of a visibly chimeric M1
plant, segregated 3 : 1). The first categories are such drastic
abnormalities that small phenotypic differences cannot be detected;
however, the less severe mutations within categories (d) and (e) were
in several quantitative respects almost identical (Table 1).  Although
the phenotypes suggest a certain degree of specificity in mutation
induction, most of these mutations may be due to more or less
unspecific deletions or other chromosomal disturbances, instead of
gene mutations. Their genetics will be further studied.<p>

Table 1:<p>

Of the 52 visible mutants found, 8 had a greater leaf number and 5 a
greater length of the longest leaf, whereas 6 mutants were earlier
flowering than the control; 7 lines were retained for certain positive
characteristics of their mutant segregants and examined in more detail
(Table 2).  Mutant number 3 is of immediate interest because of its
marker gene which behaves as a single recessive, and its otherwise
normal appearance and behaviour.<p>

Table 2:  Characteristics of 7 M2 mutants<p>

Except for number 53 all mutants had a very low fertility which offset
the advantage of earliness.  Mutant number 12 had a much more rapid
succession of leaves (number of days to flowering / number of leaves)
than the corresponding control; to a lesser extent this was also the
case in no.'s 84, 56 and possibly 53.  The inheritance of these
phenomena will be studied. The search for similar mutants with full
fertility will be continued.<p>

Length of longest leaf: The variation coefficient (CV %) of the M2
families was greater than of the control; only 3 out of 110 families
had a significantly (P= 0.05) smaller CV % than the control.  A
comparison of leaf lengths, relative to the control, of the M1 plants
and their M2 offspring revealed that selection for shorter leaves is
not possible in the M1 (chi sq. for correspondence between M1 and M2 :
78.8; 3 d.f.).  On the other hand selection for longer leaves in the
M12 seems possible (chi sq. = 0.11) ; as physiological disturbances only
very rarely lead to leaf enlargement this result is not unexpected.<p>

Number of days flowering: Also with regard to flowering date, most M2
lines had a greater variation than the control; only 3 progenies out
of 110 had a significantly smaller CV %.  Several progenies
significantly earlier than the control thus still contained
significantly later individuals and vice versa. There appeared to be
virtually no correspondence in number of days to flowering, relative
to the respective controls (+ or - values), between the M1 plants and
their M2 lines.  Consequently, no selection for earliness or lateness
would be possible in the M1 generation. This shows that the
differences in flowering date in the M1 are of physiological origin.
This is also demonstrated by the relationship between leaf length (x)
and the number of days to flowering (y) , afor which the regression
coefficients were: bxy = 0.51 in the M1; ; +0.08 in the M2, and +0.11
in the control.  This indicates a general weakness in the M1,
expressed as reduced leaf length combined with late flowering.<p>

In the M2 (72 lines and their control) no significant correlation was
found between the number of days to flowering on the one hand and
germination speed or length of the longest leaf on the other hand. As
expected, there was only a slight and statistically insignificant
correspondence between the variation coefficients of the M2 relative
to their control (CV% M2/ CV% control) for leaf length and number of
days to flowering, respectively.  Although there was a marked
regression between average root length 100 hours after germination and
the number of days to flowering (b = 0.64), the correlation was too
weak to allow selection for flowering date on the basis of the
root-length measurement; furthermore, the control showed a very
similar regression (b = o.68).<p>

Chimerism: Twenty five M1 plants were visibly chimeric for fertility
or for some morphological or colour change; these were partly dominant
mutations or chromosome aberrations and partly plasmatic mutations.
Of these plants, 2 -4 parts were harvested separately.  The offspring
of 14 of these was tested for significant differences in respect of
(a) speed of germination; (b) segregation of nongerminators; (c) root
length after 100 hours; (d) leaf length, and (e) number of days to
flowering.<p>

Two M1 plants appeared to be chimeric in respect of one of these
quantitative traits, 3 M1's were chimeric for 2 traits, 3 M1's were
chimeric for 3 traits and 1 M1 was chimeric for 4 of these traits.  In
the two M1 plants of which 4 parts were harvested, 3 parts proved to
be of different idiotype. This illustrates that seed irradiation may
induce significant chimerism for various quantitative characters.<p>
