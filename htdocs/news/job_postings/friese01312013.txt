Group Leader Positions 

The Gregor Mendel Institute of Molecular Plant Biology (GMI) is currently recruiting Group Leaders, 
primarily at the junior level (equivalent to Assistant Professor, but limited to a maximum of 8 years), 
although exceptional applications at the senior level (equivalent to permanent Associate or Full 
Professor) will be considered. Applications from any area of plant biology will be considered, and side 
projects involving organisms other than plants are possible. Our main criterion is scientific 
excellence. Candidates are expected to develop an independent research program at the very highest 
level. The GMI offers internationally competitive packages, including substantial institutional funding 
and access to state-of-the-art facilities. 

The GMI is a basic research institute in the field of plant molecular biology, founded by the Austrian 
Academy of Sciences in 2000, and currently comprising around 100 researchers in 8 independent research 
groups (http://www.gmi.oeaw.ac.at&lt;http://www.gmi.oeaw.ac.at/&gt;). It is part of the Vienna Biocenter 
Campus, a research cluster in the center of Vienna, home to over 1,700 researchers from over 40 countries 
(http://www.viennabiocenter.org/). The working language is English. 

Please send your application, including a curriculum vitae, a description of your proposed research, and 
contact details for at least three referees to Carmen Ilic (carmen.ilic@gmi.oeaw.ac.at). 

Review of applications is ongoing. Informal inquiries can be directed to Dr. Magnus Nordborg 
(magnus.nordborg@gmi.oeaw.ac.at).
