INTRODUCTION<p>

The energy acquired by living cells preserves in effective form mainly
molecules of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) which thereafter serve as
"energetic currency" for functioning of all the systems of a cell. It
is known that synthesis of ATP is connected with discharge of membrane
by means of a special enzyme called ATP-ase activity. According to the
data of Selvin the natural substate for ATP-ase is Mg-ATP but free Mg+
2 and ATP serve as competitive inhibitors of the process. The
inhibiting effect of ATP and ions of Mg on CF 1-ATP-ase of
chloroplasts was studied depending on their concentraiton, pH-medium
and in presence of stimulating agents of various nature. The reduction
of inhibiting effect by the stimulators of CF 1-ATP-ase makes it
possible to find the "true" Mg-dependent activity of the enzyme. This
study was carried on the solubilized CF 1 of pea.<p>

At the same time the data on Mg-dependent ATP-ase of chloroplasts of
higher plants practically lack. Thus, the study of this process in
various forms of Arabidopsis differing by their photosynthetic
productivity caused by the more powerful energetic potential in more
productive form (Yakubova and Nazarova, 1980), is of great interest.<p>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<p>

During this study we tried to determine Mg-dependent ATP-ase activity
of Arabidopsis chloroplasts and chose concentrations of agents such as
natrium sulphite and ethanol stimulating the process. Chloroplasts
were isolated by modified FRY's method (Fry, 1970), chlorophyll was
determined by the Arnon technique (Arnon, 1949). The enzyme activity
was evaluated by quantity of hydrolyzing ATP per time unit. For the
determination of ATP-ase activity 1.5 ml of reactionary medium was
used containing: tris-HC1-buffer (pH 7.8) 9 microM; ATP 5 micro M;
MgCl 2 5 micro M; Na 2 SO 3 180 mM; C 2 H 5 OH 38%; glutathione 20 mM.
Tubes with the reactionary mixture were incubated in the dark at
different periods of time at the temperature of 37*degrees*C. For this
study we took Arabidopsis thaliana the original race Enkheim and his
highly productive mutant Triplex.<p>

activity of chloroplasts of Arabidopsis thaliana, race Enkheim and his
mutant "Triplex".<p>

RESULTS<p>

During our study it was shown that the result of the reaction depended
on the concentration of chlorophyll. The optimal concentration of
chlorophyll for the original race is 0.150 mg, that for the mutant is
0.280 mg per sample (Table 1). At equal contents of chlorophyll in
chloroplasts of each form the maximal output of the reaction was shown
for the chloroplasts of the original form.<p>

Various concentrations of ethanol differently affected Mg-dependent
ATP-ase activity of Arabidopsis chloroplasts. &#199;onsiderable
stimulation (to 164%) was observed at 38% ethanol. This effect was
reached at 20 min. of incubation (Table 2). Subsequent incubation
leads to the reduction of the degree of stimulation.<p>

activity of chloroplasts of A. thaliana, race Enkheim and its mutant
"Triplex".<p>

The effect of various concentrations of natriumsulphite (40, 80, 100,
180 mM) on Mg-dependent ATP-ase activity of chloroplasts was studied.
The maximal output of phosphate was observed at sulphite concentration
equal to 180 mM (Table 3). In the original form stimulating effect
with natrium sulphite utilization was 245% at 20 min. of incubation.
Subsequent incubation to gradual reduction of the effect. In the
mutant the maximal effect of stimulation was at 30 min. of incubation
and reached 431%. In the subsequent half an hour the effect of
stimulation was reduced almost half as much.<p>

CONCLUSION<p>

According to the data obtained we can conclude that the enzyme in the
mutant chloroplast is affected to a great extent by various
stimulating agents such as ethanol and natrium sulphite.<p>

It is known that all the compounds studied under experimental
conditions easily accept and return protons. It is proposed that the
mechanism of action of stimulating compounds on Mg-dependent ATP-ase
in chloroplasts lies in an increased rate of the limiting stage of
translocation of protons by the enzyme which is connected with the
catalytic action of ATP hydrolysis (Malyan and Akulova, 1978).<p>
