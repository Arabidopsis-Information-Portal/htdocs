<h2>Investigations on Arabidopsis in the Apollo-Soyuz Test Program</h2><p>

H. BUECHER and V. WEIDEMANN<p>


The common US-Soviet Apollo-Soyuz Test Program starts on July 15,
1975. As at the last two Apollo flights (Apollo 16 and 17) the
Biostack experiment will be included. The objective of the Biostack
experiment is to study the biological effects of individual heavy
particles (HZE-particles) of cosmic radiation. Several kinds of
biological subjects were selected e.g.: Bacillus subtilis spores,
Artemia salina eggs, Tibolium castaneum eggs and as plant matrial
seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana En-2.<p>

The Biostack consists of a series of monolayers of biological subjects
with each layer sandwiched between several different physical track
detectors. The stack is stored in a hermetically sealed cylindrical
aluminum container, which is placed in the Apollo-command module. The
biological material is embedded in water soluble foils of polyvinlyl
alcohol (PVA) before placement into the Biostack.  REINHOLZ proposed
Arabidopsis thaliana for this experiment. The embedding of Arabidopsis
seeds in PVA has no influence on germination and growth even after
storage up to 18 months (REINHOLA, 1972). The biological layers are
either in contact with nuclear emulsions or cellulose nitrate
(CN)-sheets. The nuclear emulsions which were attached to a biological
layer, carry an optical photo of the distribution pattern in the
biological layer and of coordinate grid in addition to the tracks of
the penetrated particles.  Microscopical analysis indicate the hit
biological objects.  In case of CN-sheets the PVA, in which the
Arabidopsis seeds are embedded is directly poured on the detector as
carrier. The fixed contact is maintained during the procedures of
processing and scanning of the detector. The correlation of hit seeds
and tracks can be done microscopically without changing this physical
relationship considering some geometrical properties.<p>

In the Biostack experiments I and II (Apollo 16 and 17) layers ff
Arabidopsis seeds were flown in contact with nuclear emulsions.  Hit,
unhit flown seeds and ground controls were separately examined by
REINHOLZ (BUCKER et al., 1973). The germination of the hit seeds seems
to be delayed. Further studies on more seeds are necessary to ensure
this effect statistically.  Moreover multicaulity was observed by the
hit seeds and occasionally by the unhit flown seeds.  Growth,
flowering time and fruiting time were not significantly influenced.<p>

For the Apollo-Soyuz flight 1975 the following improvals were made:<p>

I.  A computer-program was established to determine the hit regions
within the seed.  This was done by approximating the shape of the
seeds as rotational ellipsoids.<p>

II.  A new embedding procedure was developed to prevent the
conglobation of the seeds during drying of the PVA-layer.<p>

1.  A lifting plate with petri dish cover spread with Parafilm will be
moved against a stretched fine nylon net attached on statives. The
width of one square of the net and the thickness of the net is in
agreement with the size of the seed.<p>

2.  Seeds are distributed on the net with a piece of spatula sized
paper.<p>

3.  The lifting plate will be lowered.  Now the individual seeds are
lined up uniformly.  Because of their rough surface they adhere in the
Parafilm.<p>

4.  A CN-sheet covered with PVA (10%, thickness 200-300 u) which is
not hard yet, has to be rolled on the Parafilm with the seeds. The
seeds are sticking now in the PVA. After drying of the PVA the seeds
were embedded with PVA (15%)<p>

By this method a layer with a diameter from 7 cm is covered with 2000
- 2500 seeds.  After the flight, the hit Arabidopsis seeds will be
divided into three groups comprising seeds which are hit either in the
radicula, or in the cotyledons, or in the shoot apex. Development of
the M1-plants will be measured periodically. Twenty descendants of
each M1-plant will be observed in regard to morphological changes
during their growth and development.  In order to state whether the
observed changes are due to mutations the progeny of the
morphologically changed plants will be examined again. Biochemical
mutations will be detected during growth in synthetic nutient medium.<p>
