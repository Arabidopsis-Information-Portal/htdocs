INTRODUCTION<p>

The availability of plant cell lines resistant to various amino acid
analogues would contribute to elucidate and facilitate an approach to
various fundamental problems of genetics of higher plants.  Namely,
their use may reveal certain genetic regulatory mechanisms controlling
biochemical pathways. They can also be used to study the protein
synthetic machinery, or to analyze the permeability processes involved
in the uptake of amino acids. They should also be considered as good
markers for genetic and cell fusion experiments to study the fate of
the hereditary material in heterozygotes or recombinants.<p>

There is an agricultural interest in such mutants of crop species
because there is a potential to increase selectively the level of
nutritionally important amino acids by their use in breeding programs
(Brock and Langridge, 1975).  Mutants of this kind have already been
reported (Carlson 1973, Widholm 1972, Chaleff and Carlson 1975).<p>

The suitability of the proposed methodology - selection of mutants
which overcome the growth inhibition due to an antimetabolite - has
also been illustrated by the use of other structural analogues or of
antibiotics or toxic products (Maliga et al., 1973a; Maliga et al.,
1973b; Binding, 1972).<p>

By using cell suspension cultures of Arabidopsis, we have attempted to
induce mutants resistant against s-aminoethylcysteine (SAEC) and
5-methyltryptophan (5-MT).<p>

MATRIAL AND METHODS<p>

Material.  Callus cultures were induced from Arabidopsis seeds of the
race Columbia. Culture conditions and procedures for determination of
growth have been reported elsewhere (Negrutiu et al., 1975).<p>

The nutrient medium used was a PG2 growth medium which contains 2 x
concentrated Gresshoff and Doy MS1 mineral salts solution (Gresshoff
and Doy, 1972), 2% glucose, 1 mg/1 2,4-D, 0.05 mg/l kinetin, and
Gamborg's B5 microelements and vitamins.  The analogues, SAEC and
5-MT, (Sigma) and several amino acids were added by sterile filtration
(Millipore, 0.2 micro m) after autoclaving.<p>

Cell suspension cultures. Cell suspensions were maintained in 1000 ml
top-arm flasks, in an open semi-continuous culture system (King and
Street, 1973), i.e., they were subcultured by pouring off 40 to 75%
(or more) of the aggregated biomass of single cells. This suspension
was filtered through 210 micro m nylon filters, and used for
mutagenesis and plating.  The fresh medium was added at a well-defined
ratio to the remaining biomass (large cell aggregates); the culture
being thus permanently maintained in a late log phase. This system,
based on the correlation between dissociation rate and growth pattern
in suspension culture, produced high amounts of single cells (0.8 to
1.8x10 6 viable cells/ml in short period of time (2 to 6 days).<p>

The number of viable cells (single cells and cell aggregates up to 10
cells) was counted in a hematocytometer under phase contrast
conditions (magnification 250x).  Cytoplasmic strands and streaming,
and the presence of the nucleus were used to classify a cell as
viable.<p>

Mutagenic treatment.  Cell suspensions were incubated in a 0.5% EMS
PG2 liquid medium for 1 hour, which permitted 50% survival of the
treated cells. The cells were then washed and finally resuspended in a
fresh medium after centifugation at 800 rpm. for 10 minutes. Treated
suspensions were then incubated for 6 to 12 days to ensure genetic
segregation and phenotypic expression of the mutations occurred, and
then plated.<p>

Plating.  Plating was performed in a thin layer of 0.33% PG2 agar
medium on top of a 0.5% solid medium. The medium was supplemented with
the appropriate concentrations of analogues. Resistant clones were
selected as they appeared over a period of one to two months. To
promote a rapid growth of plated cells, cell densities should range
from 5 x 10 3 to 10 5 cells per Petri plate (30 ml of solid medium).<p>

RESULTS<p>

Growth inhibition by SAEC and 5-MT.  Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the
relationship between the growth and the concentration of SAEC and 5-MT
in callus culture, starting with a 120-130 mg inoculum fresh weight.
As observed after a culture period of three weeks, complete inhibition
was caused by SAEC at 100 mg/1 (6x10E-4M) and by 5-MT at 40 mg/l
(1.8x10E-4M).  These inhibitory concentrations are defined as the
effective concentrations of the analogues. For selection purposes,
when the cultures are maintained longer than 60 days, the
concentrations of analogues were 400 mg/l for SAEC and 100 mg/l for
5-MT, respectively.<p>

It is also interesting to report that callus cultures can grow in the
presence of much higher concentrations of the analogue concentrations
than normal plants. Table 1 shows that a 10 times lower concentration
of SAEC than the effective concentration defined with callus cultures
was still inhibitory for seedlings of Arabidopsis.  Germination was
not affected by concentrations as high as 200 mg/l, but only
approximately 20% of the cultured seeds developed into 4
leaf-plantlets at 10 mg/l of SAEC.<p>

of the wild type Columbia plantlet. The plants were grown on a mineral
medium (Jacobs, 1964) with perlite as substrate.<p>

Reversal of the inhibition by amino acids.  If the analogues inhibit
growth by competing with the normal substrates for the use of specific
enzymes of the tryptophan or lysine pathways, the addition of lysine
or tryptophan to the culture medium may release this growth
inhibition.<p>

Effects of lysine and of tryptophan on the growth of callus cultures -
alone or in combination with other amino acids, belonging to the
corresponding branched matabolic pathways - were determined in the
presence and in the absence of inhibitory concentrations of SAEC and
5-MT respectively (see Tables 2 and 3).<p>

The inhibition of Arabidopsis callus development by 50 mg/l of 5-MT
was partially (43 to 77%) reversed by the different concentrations of
tryptophan tested.  (Table 2) Only slight differences have been
registered in the range of 5-80 mg/l of tryptophan. At a level of 5
mg/l-which did not inhibit growth when the amino acid was used alone
in the medium-tryptophan promoted a recovery, almost comparable to
that obtained with higher concentrations. The addition of
phenylalanine (10 mg/l) to tryptophan further improved the growth.
This effect was not observed when tyrosine (10 mg/l) was present along
with tryptophan and phenylalanine.<p>

The inhibition of callus growth by 200 mg/l of SAEC was not reversed
very effectively by the addition of lysine or lysine combined with
threonine and methionine at concentrations mentioned in Table 3.<p>

Isolation of resitant mutants.  Mutagenic treatment of cell
suspensions followed by plating were performed as described in
Material and Methods. The mutants were selected by adding cells into a
culture media containing 400 mg/l of SAEC or 100 mg/l of 5-MT, and by
incubation for 2 months.  Control plates needed about 10 days to start
active growth.  The plating efficiency varied between 14 to 23% of the
plated cells.  At the end of the incubation period, growth centers
were noticed on a few plates, at a frequency of about one resistant
cell in 6 x 10 6 cells.<p>

Table 3: Release of growth inhibition by SAEC.  Callus growth in the
presence of SAEC (200 mg/l) and of the amino acids listed was
determined after 21 days, using 50 calluses for each treatment.
(Inoculum fresh weight was 120-130 mg)<p>

Most of the calluses growing on the inhibitory concentration of SAEC,
grew at a normal rate when subcultured into fresh SAEC medium. Three
resistant SAEC lines, originating from distinct mutagenic events have
been isolated.  (RAEC1, RAEC2, RAEC3).<p>

In cases when the calluses were grown on 5-MT, all the isolates
obtained after plating were lost after a transfer to fresh medium--in
contrast to the good yield observed with SAEC treatment.<p>

Figure 3: The effect of S-aminoethylcysteine on growth of RAEC3
resistant line (increase in fresh weight in 21 days as compared to the
normal cells). The inoculum was 120-130 mg per plate.<p>

Growth rate of the RAEC3 was studied in particular.  Figure 3 shows
that growth of mutant cells in the presence of 200 or 400 mg/l SAEC
reaches approximately 50% of the growth of normal cells in the absence
of the analogue. Growth of resistant cells was inhibited only by about
64% on 1000 mg/l SAEC, while a similar inhibition is already observed
with 45-50 mg/l SAEC in the case of normal cells.  In the absence of
the analogue, the average growth of RAEC3 cells is 73% of that of the
control line (wild type).<p>

DISCUSSION<p>

The results presented here show that Arabidopsis cells can be selected
for resistance to growth inhibition by amino acid analogues. The
biochemical nature of the resistance in the case of RAEC cells has not
yet been analyzed. Reasons why the resistance to 5-MT was not
confirmed through the transfers, requires further investigation.<p>

The growth inhibition reversal data may indicate that 5-MT inhibits
tissue growth by inhibiting key enzymes of the tryptophan pathway. The
partial recovery of the 5-MT effect by the amino acids tested in Table
2, the positive contribution of phenylalanine to the release of the
inhibition due to the analogue, raise some interesting questions as to
where, along metabolic pathways, the analogue exerts its inhibition.
If the block occurred before chrismic acid, tryptophan alone would not
reverse the growth inhibition, unless a separate pathway brings about
the biosynthesis of phenylalanine and tyrosine (see also Widholm,
1972).<p>

The fact that lysine, or lysine combined with methionine and threonine
release the growth from inhibition by SAEC only at a low extent,
raises interesting questions concerning the nature of RAEC mutants.<p>

Studies will be undertaken (1) to confirm the stability of the mutant
in absence of the selecting agent, (2) to determine the uptake and the
incorporation of SAEC into proteins, (3) to determine the relative
pool size of the corresponding amino acid(s) etc.  Such mutant lines
are now transferred to regeneration media, to allow the confirmation
of the mutation at the plant level by genetical analysis.<p>
