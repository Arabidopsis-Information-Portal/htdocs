AIS Vol 02:<h2>A major mutation in Arabidopsis thaliana</h2><p>

In the F2 generation of plants X-rayed in the zygote stage a strange
mutant arose.  Besides other altered characteristics the mutant shows
the loss of family characteristics of the Cruciferae. The number of
sepals, petals, anthers and carpels is often increased, but
occasionally the ovary consists of one carpel only:<p>

Normal and abnormal flowers are present in the inflorescence of one
plant.  All pods of the mutant even those originating from a normal
ovary with two carpels show a structure different from that of a
normal Arabidopsis pod.<p>

Crossings of the mutant with the original strain Enkheim as well as
reciprocal crossings are fertil.  The mutant remains constant after
self-pollination.  The breeding of the crossings has not yet been
finished.  It seems that we are dealing with a mutant in one gene
only.<p>
