ABSTRACT<p>

Development of a model Arabidopsis disease is of interest so that the
powerful molecular genetic techniques adapted for use with this plant
can be used to characterize disease resistance. Fifteen races of
Arabidopsis thaliana were tested for susceptibility to the crucifer
pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris. Leaves of race Pr-O
exhibited a spreading chlorosis 72 h after infiltration. Based on
assays of chlorophyll loss, race Pr-O appeared more susceptible to
this bacterial pathogen than the other Arabidopsis races tested. This
newly discovered host-pathogen interaction may prove to be a useful
model system for studying disease development in plants.<p>

INTRODUCTION<p>

Arabidopsis thaliana has many attractive features as a model organism
for classical and molecular genetics. Arabidopsis has a rapid
reproductive cycle and a small genome with little repetitive DNA
(Leutwiler et al., 1984). This crucifer can be transformed using
Agrobacterium-derived vectors (Lloyd et al., 1986), can be regenerated
from protoplasts (Damm and Willmitzer, 1988), and can maintain an
active, maize transposable element (Van Sluys et al., 1987). These
characteristics suggest that Arabidopsis might be a powerful tool for
studying the molecular basis of disease resistance.<p>

Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris, the causal agent of black rot
of many crucifers (Williams, 1980), has been studied as a model
organism for investigating the genetics of bacterial pathogenicity
(Tang et al., 1987). By complementing non-pathogenic mutants with
fragments of the wild type pathogen DNA, a locus for pathogenicity has
been identified that restores pathogenicity to the mutants (Dow et
al., 1987 and Shaw et al., 1988). Recently, Boucher et al. (1987)
found homology in Xanthomonas with the hrp locus in Pseudomonas
solanacearum that controls the initiation of disease symptoms on host
plants and the development of the hypersensitive, resistance response
on non-host plants (Lindgren et al., 1986). The hrp locus is believed
to encode a regulatory protein that controls the expression of genes
that elicit plant defenses against bacterial infection (Grimm and
Panopoulos, in press). While a hrp locus has not been identified in
Xanthomonas, an anogous regulatory protein could be encoded by the
pathogenicity locus.<p>

Previously, Balasz and Lebeurier (1981) have shown that Arabidopsis is
host of the Cauliflower mosaic virus. In this paper we present
evidence that Arabidopsis is also a host of Xanthomonas campestris pv.
campestris. Inoculated Arabidopsis leaves turned chlorotic within 72
hours after inoculation, and the sysmptoms show specificity among
different races of Arabidopsis. This new host-pathogen interaction may
prove to be a useful model system for studying the molecular basis of
disease resistance in plants.<p>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<p>

Plant material<p>

The races of Arabidopsis thaliana utilized in this study are listed in
Table 1. Plants were grown in a 1:1:1 mixture of perlite, vermiculite,
and sphagnum (Somrville and Ogren, 1982) in a growth chamber
maintained at 25*degrees*C for 16 hours during the day cycle (250
microEmE-2sE-1) and at 20*degrees*C for the night cycle. Arabidopsis
plants were grown for 3 weeks before use, while Brassica campestris
plants were grown for 4 weeks before use.<p>

Bacteria<p>

Spontaneous rifampicin-resistant mutants of Xanthomonas campestris pv.
campestris (reportedly strain 84-1 NR, a derivative of 2D250 described
in Shaw and Kado, 1986) were selected on YDC agar (Wilson et al.,
1967) containing 100 micro g rifampicin/ml. Colonies were streaked
onto a second rifampicin plate, transferred to liquid medium 523
(Dhingra and Sinclair, 1985) containing 50 micro g rifampicin/ml, and
grown overnight at 30*degrees*C (shaken at 200 revolutions per minute)
in the dark. Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae (strain POSSD220
described in Vincent and Fulbright, 1983) was transferred from Kings B
medium agar (Schaad, 1980) to Kings B broth and grown overnight at
30*degrees*C (shaken at 200 revolutions per minute).<p>

Preparation of inoculum<p>

Broth culture was centrifuged for 2 minutes at high speed on a Fisher
micro-centrifuge (model 235B). The supernatant was decanted, and the
pellet was resuspended in 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 6.9. The
bacterial suspension was washed with buffer a second time, and the
inoculum concentation, determined by measuring the absorbance of the
bacterial suspension at 640 nm using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 3B uv/vis
spectrophotometer, was adjusted to 1 x 10 8 cell/ml.<p>

Inoculation of plant tissue<p>

A single site on each of two leaves per plant was inoculated using a 1
ml plastic syringe without needle by the method of Collinge et al.
(1987). About 10 micro l of the inoculum was infiltrated through the
stomates by gently applying force on the plunger. Excess inoculum,was
blot-dried from the surface of the leaf, and the petioles of
infiltrated leaves were marked using a Shparpie pen. Control leaves
received no treatment since buffer was found to have no effect on the
leaf chlorophyll content.<p>

Chlorophyll measurements<p>

At daily intervals, five inoculated Arabidopsis leaves were harvested.
Leaf discs were removed from the inoculation site and were extracted
for chlorophyll in 100% methanol (1 ml pr disc) at 50*degrees*C for 20
minutes. The absorbance of the solution was measured at 666 nm and 653
nm using a Perkin-Elmer spectrophotometer, and the amount of
chlrophyll was determined using the formula of Lichtenthaler and
Wellburn (1983). Each experiment was repeated three times, and mean
chlorophyll values were determined in micrograms per square centimeter
of leaf tissue. Mean chlorophyll values for inoculated plants were
standardized by dividing by the mean chlorophyll values of control
plants sampled the same day, and expressing the result as a
percentage, called the chlorophyll content. The chlorophyll contents
were subjected to an analysis of variance, and mean chlorophyll
contents, averaged over 8 days of measurement, were compared using
Fisher's least significant difference test.<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

Symptom development<p>

Leaves of Arabidopsis race Pr-O infiltrated with X.c. campestris (c.
10 8 cells/ml) showed an initial water soaking that cleared within 24
hours. Leaf yellowing was visible 72 hours after inoculation which
subsequently spread beyond the inoculated area (Figure 1a). This was
soon followed by browning and cell collapse within the inoculated
region (Figure 1b). In contrast, leaves infiltrated with Pseudomonas
syringae pv. syringae (c. 10 8 cells/ml) showed no yellowing. Leaves
infiltrated with P. s. syringae turned light brown-grey within 48
hours, and the necrosis did not spread beyond the inoculation site.
Leaves infiltrated with 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 6.9 also
showed an initial water soaking but otherwise had the same appearance
as uninoculated leaves.<p>

The disease symptoms seen on Arabidopsis were similar to those
observed when Brassica campestris, a known host, was inoculated with
X. c. campestris by the same method. Brassica leaves showed bright
yellowing at the infiltration site 72 hours after inoculation which
later turned brown and necrotic (Collinge et al., 1987). In contrast
to these symptoms, when Brasica leaves were inoculated with P.s.
syringae leaf yellowing was absent. Instead, the infiltration site
turned dark gray within 24 hours, and the necrosis was contained
within the inoculation site. Therefore, the X.c. campestris-induced
disease reaction could be distinguished from the hypersensitive,
resistance response by the presence of spreading chlorosis. From an
infected Arabidopsis leaf we recovered a bacterium that was identified
as the inoculated Xanthomonad by the following criteria; rod-shaped;
gram negative; rifampicin resistance; yellow, mucoid colony on YDC
agar; non-fluorescence on Kings B agar; and growth on SX agar (Schaad,
1980). This bacterium was able to induce the same symptoms in a second
inocululation. Furthermore metabolically active bacteria were
necessary to induce symptoms; leaves inoculated with bacteria that
were heat-killed in a boiling water bath showed no yellowing. These
results suggest that X.c. campestris was the infectious agent that
caused leaf yellowing and necrosis.<p>

Host specificity<p>

In addition to Pr-O, 14 other Arabidopsis races were screened for
susceptibility to X.c. campestris. All the races responded similarly
to infection with X.c. campestris; however, the chlorosis appeared to
have spread more rapidly on Arabidopsis race Pr-O. Of the 15 races
examined, Columbia, Bur-O and Pr-O were selected for further study. In
order to quantitate the responses of the three races of Arabidopsis to
infection with X.c. campestris, a method based on chlorophyll loss was
developed. This analysis is based on the assumption that more
susceptible races of Arabidopsis lose chlorophyll faster than less
susceptivle races. Since the total leaf chlorophyll value varies among
the different races, one race may yellow more quickly than another yet
both may lose chlorophyll at the same rate. Thus a subjective, disease
rating scale for determining relative susceptibility is insufficient.
Polynomical regression analysis of the chlorophyll content of
inoculated leaves relative to the controls over a seven day period
gave a quantitative criterion for comparing the responses of different
races to inoculation with X.c. campestris. The resulting chlorophyll
profiles suggest that the races Columbia and Bur-O responded very
similarly to inoculation with X.c. campestris, but the race Pr-O was
more susceptible than both Columbia and Bur-O (Figure 2). Using
Fishser's least significant difference test we found that the mean
chlorophyll content of Columbia over the seven day period was not
significantly different from Bur-O; however, the mean chlorophyll
content of Pr-O was significantly different from both Columbia and
Bur-O (Table 2). Thus, the race Pr-O was statistically more
susceptible than both Columbia and Bur-O.<p>

Experiments are now in progress to determine the inheritance of the
susceptibility observed in Pr-O. If this response proves to be a
simply inherited trait, then by mutagenesis, we may be able to
identify the plant components that initiate compatible reactions.<p>
