Session 4: Hormone Signalling</H1>

<H4>
Chair: Caren Chang, University of Maryland, USA</H4>

<P>Caren Chang (University of Maryland) presented evidence that the histidine
protein kinase domains of the ETR1 and ERS ethylene receptors can physically
associate with the amino-terminal domain of the CTR1 protein kinase. These
interactions were detected using the yeast two-hybrid assay and an <I>in
vitro</I> protein-binding assay. The interacting portion of CTR1 is the
presumed regulatory domain, suggesting that the regulation of CTR1 activity
involves direct interaction with the ethylene receptors.

<P>Next, G. Eric Schaller (University of New Hampshire) presented data
demonstrating that the ETR1 ethylene receptor contains histidine protein
kinase activity. This activity had been postulated based on sequence motifs
shared with bacterial two-component regulators, but it was unknown whether
the ETR1 receptor necessarily contained this activity. Auto-phosphorylation
was observed <I>in vitro</I> using a purified glutathione-S-transferase
fusion to the ETR1 histidine kinase domain. Mutations that eliminated either
the presumed phosphorylation site (His353), or catalytic residues within
the kinase domain, were found to abolish auto-phosphorylation.

<P>Tatsuo Kakimoto (Osaka University) presented results from two types
of screens for cytokinin signalling mutants. One screen was for EMS-induced
mutations that confer hypersensitivity to cytokinins in callus. This screen
yielded recessive mutations in two complementation groups, <I>ckh1</I>
and <I>ckh2</I>. The <I>CKH1</I> and <I>CKH2</I> genes may represent negative
regulators of cytokinin signalling. In a different strategy, activation-tagged
calli were screened for typical cytokinin responses in the absence of cytokinin.
Two loci (<I>CKI1</I> and <I>CKI2</I>) were tagged and cloned: CKI1 is
a member of the two-component family of histidine protein kinases, and
CKI2, which has not been completely cloned, also appears to be a histidine
protein kinase. An interesting possibility is that these genes encode cytokinin
receptors.

<P>&nbsp;Dario Bonetta, from Peter McCourt's lab (University of Toronto)
described the vegetative defects of a mutant, era1, which was isolated
based on having an enhanced seed dormancy response to exogenous abscisic
acid. ERA1 is postulated to be a negative regulator of abscisic acid responses.
Prior cloning of <I>ERA1</I> indicated that the ERA1 gene product is a
farnesyl transferase. The <I>era1</I> mutant displays reduced branching,
increased leaf size and twice as many floral buds per inflorescence. These
defects indicate potential new roles for abscisic acid (and/or protein
farnesylation) in vegetative development.

<P>Mark Estelle (Indiana University) discussed similarities between genes
from various systems that, taken together, suggest that ubiquitin-mediated
events play an important role in auxin response. AXR1 and TIR1 are known
to act synergistically in auxin signalling in <I>Arabidopsis</I>. AXR1
has similarity to the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, and is similar to
yeast ENR2, which is required for specific ubiquitination events in cell
cycle regulation. TIR1 is similar to both human SKP2, which is required
for the G1/S transition, and yeast GRR1, which is required for cyclin degradation.
TIR1 also contains an F-box, which in fungi and mammals binds to a protein
(SKP1) that is involved in target recognition in ubiquitin conjugation.

<P>Ingela Fridborg from Peter Engstrom's lab (Uppsala University, Sweden)
presented the cloning of <I>SHI</I>, a new putative zinc-finger protein
gene. <I>SHI</I> was isolated from an Ac/Ds transposon tagging system designed
to recover gain-of-function mutants. The shi mutant phenotype is caused
by over-expression of the <I>SHI </I>gene, initiated from a CaMV 35S promoter
in the Ds element. The mutant phenotype, which resembles that of gibberellin
biosynthesis mutants, is not rescued by exogenous gibberellin. SHI is a
potential negative regulator of gibberellin induced stem cell elongation.
