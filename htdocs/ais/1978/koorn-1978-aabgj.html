Trisomic sets in Arabidopsis have been developed and used for the
localization of linkage groups at Missouri University (Lee-Chen and
Steinitz-Sears, 1967; Sears and Lee-Chen, 1970) and at Gottingen
University (Robbelen and Kribben, 1966; Lee-Chen and Burger, 1967).<p>

To obtain trisomics in the genetic background used at our laboratory
(race Landsberg 'erecta'), a trisomic set was developed by looking for
deviating types in the progeny of a 3n x 2n cross, crossing these
types with diploids and selecting for progenies that only segregated
for the presumed trisomics and diploids. In this way ultimately 5
different phenotypes were selected, which had the chromosome number
11, and which were initially thought to be the complete set of 5
trisomics. A description of the types is given in Table 1.<p>

Table 1: Characteristics of five trisomics compared with the diploid<p>

To identify the corresponding linkage groups of each of the trisomic
lines, these were all crossed as female parents with the well-known
linkage group markers and a number of mutants isolated at this
laboratory. In the F1 trisomic plants were selfed. The F2 ratios were
counted separately, where possible, in the trisomic and the diploid
progeny. The results are summarized in Table 2.<p>

The F2 generations of crosses with T1A and T1B showed deviations from
the ratios called trisomic at the bottom of Table 2. Therefore these
are presented in detail in Table 3. The ratio in the diploid progeny
of the crosses concerned is equal or higher than 3:1 and lower than
8:1 and secondly very few mutant types occurred among the trisomics.
Such data can be understood by assuming that T1A and T1B are not
primary trisomics but telotrisomics (Khush, 1973). The loci an, cer
and a then have to be on the chromosome arm additional in T1A and ch,
clv and ap on the chromosome arm additional in T1B. Crossing over
between locus and centromere accounts for the few mutant types among
the trisomics ("double reduction"). Probably ch is not far from the
centromere.<p>

Table 2: Results of trisomic analysis.<p>

It is significant that in the progeny of both T1A and T1B
telotrisomics very small plants occurred in low frequency. These
resembled small versions of T1B, but their fertility was much more
reduced and their flowers were very irregular (Figure 1). In fact they
fitted very well to the description of the fragilis trisomic (cf.
Sears and Lee-Chen, 1970). The occurrence in low frequency of primary
trisomics in the progeny of telotrisomics has been reported in other
plant species (see Khush, 1973). The segregation of the same primary
trisomic type from both T1A and T1B indicates that T1A and T1B are
telotrisomics with different arms of the same chromosome.<p>

Table 3: F2 segregation data of crosses of T1A and T1B with several
markers.<p>

From linkage studies with intercalated markers Feenstra (1978) showed
that ch (corresponding with our T1B) is situated on the same
chromosome an (corresponding with our T1A) although far apart from
each other. Feenstra's proof and our findings are in mutual agreement,
but clearly at variance with the results reported by Lee-Chen and
Steinitz-Sears (1967, 1970) who concluded that ch is located on the II
trisomic and an on the fragilis trisomic. It must be added however,
that these authors state (Lee-Chen and Steinitz-Sears, 1967) that ch
gave somewhat variable results in F2 from crosses with II. Besides, a
result of crossing ch with the fragilis trisomic to prove that ch is
not located on this trisomic has never been reported.<p>

the progeny of telotrisomics T1A resp. T1B, T1A, T1B and diploid
Landsberg 'erecta'.<p>

The interpetation of the other results of Table 2 gives no difficulty
as far as it concerns the T2 and T3 trisomics; they fit well to the
description of resp the 'Round' and 'Yellow' trisomic of Lee-Chen and
Steinitz-Sears and carry the same linkage group markers as indicated
by these authors.<p>

As we did not locate tz and some other markers, the trisomic of
linkage group 5 is missing from our set.<p>

None of the markers of linkage groups 1-5 could be located on T4, but
4 of our markers showed the classical trisomic ratios in crosses with
T4. Furthermore linkage group 6 may also correspond to T4, at least
Sears and Lee-Chen (1970) report this group to correspond to their
concave trisomic, which by elimination we tentatively equalize to T4.
On the other hand Fischerova (1975) claims that linkage group 6 is on
the same chromosome (our missing trisomic) as linkage group 5.<p>

Further studies (linkage- and trisomic analysis) are in progress to
resolve the latter issue (linkage group 6), and to in general extend
the gene map of Arabidopsis.<p>
