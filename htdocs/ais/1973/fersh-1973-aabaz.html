The correlation between the root growth and other physiological
processes of plants have not been studied completely. Researches of
CHVOSTOVA (1959) showed a positive correlation between the inhibition
of the root growth of barley and the extent of mitotic damage after
irradiation.  CONTANT and DANKERT (1968) indicated a high correlation
(r=0.91) between the root length and the survival. The connection
between the decrease of root elongation measured 100 hours after
germination and flowering time of the irradited plants was much less
clear.  In the investigations with Arabidopsis the root length and the
appearance of the cotyledons (3rd day after planting) and the
appearance of the rosette leaves (7th day after emergence) is often
used as an index of radiation injury to seeds (MULLER, 1964; SANINA,
1970).<p>

The aim of this paper is to estimate the length of the root in various
phases of the development of irradiated plants relative to the
control.  Arabidopsis thaliana race Enkheim was the experimental
material. Before the sowing the seeds were irradiated by gamma-rays at
doses of 10, 30 and 60 krad at the dose rate of 3 x 10 E3 rad/ min.  A
portion of the control and of the irradiated seeds were sown in the
Petri dishes of for observations of root length, the rest was sown in
the test-tubes to observe the influence of the irradiation on the root
growth and other developmental characters. The germination of the
seeds in the Petri dishes and test tubes was simultaneous irrespective
of the dose of irradition. The root growth was depressed and the
development of the rosette was delayed with an increase of the dose of
the irradiation (Table 1).<p>

Table 1: The influence of gamma-rays on the root length and on the
time of appearance of the rosette<p>

Table 1 gives the statistical parameters of the following characters:
1-the root length on the 3rd day after germination, 2-the root length
on the 7th day after germination, 3-the time of appearance of the
rosette.<p>

A correlation matrix analysis (Table 2) indicates that in the control
plants and in the group which received only 10 krad irradiation there
is no correlation between criteria 1 and 2, but at the higher doses
there is a good correlation between estimates no. 1 and 2.  The time
of appearance of the rosette is closely correlated with the root
length of the control and irradiated plants. At the same time the
appearance of the rosette has a positive connection with the other
development phases (FERSHTAT, SAVIN and STEPANENKO, 1971).<p>

The results indicate that an observation of the root growth at the
beginning of the rosette development provides a practical estimate of
the radiation damage.<p>
