<h2> Nitrous acid effects on germination and mutation rate in Arabidopsis</h2><p>

Although nitrous acid is a satisfactory mutgen when used on some
microorganisms (MUNDRY and GIERER, 1958, and others) it is a weak
mutagen when used on higher plants (MULLER, 1965; BROCK, 1971).  We
have tried various treatment modifications with Arabidopsis seeds with
the object of getting high mutation frequency.  Variations of dose, pH
and length of presoaking time have been tried.<p>

Seeds of A. thaliana (L.) Heynh. race Landsberg were presoaked in
distilled water for 30 hours then treated with HNO2 (from 0.03 M NaNO2
in acetate buffer), pH 4.6 for 60, 90 or 120 minutes.  Seeds were then
soaked for 2 hours in phosphate buffer, pH 7.1 before sowing on
nutrient-salt agar.  Germination of the control was 100% at 1 day
while all treated lots showed less than 50% germination.  At 4 days,
germination in lots treated for 60, 90 and 120 minutes was
respectively 77.1, 48.3 and 29.3% .  Based on these germination
results at this concentration of HNO2, 60-90 minute treatment time
should be suitable for mutation induction test (roughly 50-75%
seedling emergence).<p>

The effects on germination of varying presoaking time in the 0-36 hour
range showed that with HNO2 concentration as described above, applied
for 75 minutes, germination was near 100% when presoaking time was
between 0-20 hours; with 37 hours presoaking the germination rate was
42%, dropping to 4% after 44 hours presoaking. We infer that beginning
near 36 hours of soaking, seeds become increasingly sensitive to the
effects of nitrous acid on processes related to germination.<p>

To test the effects of varying pH, HNO2 was prepared in acetate buffer
at pH 3.6, 4.0, 4.4, 4.6, 4.8, 5.2 and 5.6.  Control seeds were soaked
in the buffer solution without NaNO2.  In this experiment 0.05 M NaNO2
was used and seeds were presoaked for 18 or 35 hours.  Germination
scored at 7 days was reduced to less than 50% at pH 4.0 and to about
20% at pH 3.6.  At pH 4.8 and higher no reduction of germination
occurred.  Acetate buffer alone had no inhibition effects. The effects
produced in buffer plus NaNO2 are attributed to HNO2.  To get maximal
effects on germination and perhaps also on mutation induction the pH
of solutions should be between 3.6 and 4.5.<p>

Based on the germination tests the treatment methods for mutation
induction were as follows.  Presoaking 30 or 35 hours, HNO2 at 0.03 M,
pH 4.0 or 4.5, treatment time 60 or 75 minutes.  One EMS treated lot
was included for comparison.  Seeds of M1 plants were collected and
sown separately.  From each M1 plant about 40 seedlings were scored
for chlorophyll mutations and the frequencies of M1 plants carrying
mutations recorded.  No sterility was found in HNO2-treated plants but
short siliques occurred in the EMS-treated plants indicating some
sterility.  Of 360 nitrous acid-treated M1 plants only 3 (0.83%) were
found to carry mutant genes for chlorophyll deficiency.  Fourteen of
93 EMS-treated plants had new mutations.  No mutants appeared in the
control population.  Treatment methods and results are shown in Table
1.  Embryo and seedling poisoning by HNO2 probably results mainly from
attacks on amino groups in metabolically active cytoplasmic components
rather than by deamination of bases inDNA.  HNO2 is obvously a very
weak mutagen when used on Arabidopsis seeds.<p>
