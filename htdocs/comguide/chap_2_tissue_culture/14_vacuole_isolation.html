VACUOLE ISOLATION
(This protocol was placed on the electronic Arabidopsis bulletin board; 
March 1992.)
From Marie-Theres Hauser, as used by Herman Hofte

 *  This is a vacuole prep protocol that worked very well in our hands both 
for Arabidopsis and tobaccoc protoplasts (see note below).

1.  SOLUTIONS
  (i) Lysis buffer0.2 M Mannitol
10% Ficoll (400)
20 mM EDTA
2 mM DTT
10 mM HEPES
pH 8.0, adjust using NaOH
Add 0.5 % BSA before use, prewarm to 42oC.

  (ii) Vacuole buffer
0.5 M mannitol
10 mM HEPES
pH 7.5, adjust using NaOH
protease inhibitor cocktail (0.5mM PMSF, 0.1 ugml-1 leupeptin, 10-7M 
pepstatin)
1mM EDTA
150 ugml-1 BSA
 *  For tobacco, use 0.6M betain in place of 0.5M mannitol.

2.  PROCEDURE
  (i) Prepare protoplasts. Make sure your protoplasts are completely 
digested (i.e., round).
  (ii) Make up 4% Ficoll solution.  Mix 1 vol lysis medium with 1.5 vol 
vacuole buffer (3 ml/ gradient)  Add BSA (0.5% final) to lysis medium, 
prewarm to 42oC.
  (iii) Place 2-5x106 protoplasts in a glass tube, spin 5 min@500rpm.
  (iv) Remove most of the supernatant, resuspend protoplasts in 
remaining liquid.
  (v) Swiftly add swiftly 5 ml prewarmed (42oC) lysis buffer, pipette the 
solution 2-3 x up and down (wide bore pipette), transfer to small glass 
tube.
  (vi) Check under microsope, vacuoles should have come out, 
chloroplasts should be spread all over the place.  If lysis is not complete, 
try repeating the agitation using the pipette. 
  (vii) Layer 3 ml 4% Ficoll solution on lysis buffer and 1 ml of vacuole 
buffer. (4% Ficoll solution made with 1 vol lysis buffer (no BSA) and 1.5 
vol vacuole buffer).  Spin for 20 min@3,000 rpm in a swing out (RC-3 or 
HB4) rotor.
 *  Vacuoles should concentrate at the interphase between the 4 % 
Ficoll and the vacuole  buffer. Collect vacuoles with a Pasteur pipette.

 *  Depending on the physiology of the plant the vacuoles can be more 
or less dense.  You will,  therefore, often find vacuoles also at the 
interphase between the 10% and the 4% layer.
