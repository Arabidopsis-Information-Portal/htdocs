One post-doctoral position is immediately available in the Plant Stress
Signaling group at the Instituto Gulbenkian de Clencia located near Lisbon,
Portugal (http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt). The position is initially for one
year but renewable up to three.

 

Research in the lab focuses on energy signaling and its connection to
environmental changes and growth. The Arabidopsis SnRK1 protein kinases play
a central role during the stress response and are required for the proper
integration of environmental cues into growth and development. Sensing and
signaling stress-associated energy deprivation, SnRK1s trigger global gene
expression reprogramming, enabling the adjustment of energy homeostasis
necessary for coping with stress. Plant miRNAs, on the other hand, have
recently been implicated in adaptive processes, mediating the response to
various nutrients as well as to other abiotic and biotic stresses. The
present position is aimed to explore the possibility that part of the
SnRK1-mediated gene expression program is implemented through miRNAs.

 

Applicants should have a PhD in genetics, biochemistry or molecular biology,
with excellent communication skills and a strong background in molecular
biology and biochemistry. Experience in miRNAs/small RNAs and/or traditional
biochemical methods (immunopurification, protein complex isolation, cell
fractionation, etc) is a plus. Interested candidates should send CV, a
letter of motivation with a brief description of previous research, and
three letters of reference to ebaena@igc.gulbenkian.pt
