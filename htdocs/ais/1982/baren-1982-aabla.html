INTRODUCTION<p>

In addition to the well-known dwarf mutants of pease (Brian et al.,
1954), maize (Phinney, 1956) and rice (Suge and Murakami, 1968)
gibberellin-sensitive mutants have also been obtained in Arabidopsis
thaliana (Koornneef et al., 1977; Koornneef, 1978; Koornneef and van
der Veen, 1980). In several cases, but not at all, dwarfism of such
mutants can be attributed to gibberellin (GA) deficiency. Dwarfism of
the single gene mutants of maize, e.g., known as d 1, d 2, d 3, and d
5 mutants, is best understood.<p>

It was shown recently that each of the four genes d 1, d 2, d 3, and d
5 controls a specific and different step in ghe GA biosynthesis
pathway (Phinney, 1982).<p>

As a result the dwarf maize mutants are deficient in endogenous GAs,
compared to the normal genetic strains, and respond by normal growth
to appropriate dosages of exogenous GAs.<p>

MATERIAL AND METHODS<p>

In Arabidopsis thaliana two types of GA-sensitive mutants were
selected previously:<p>

1) Non-germinating dwarfs which require exogenous applications of GA
for germination and subsequent development, 2) Germinating dwarfs
which do germinate without exogenous GA.<p>

Ent-kaurene is a key intermediate in the GA biosynthetic pathway and
its formation can be studied in vitro. The wild type, three
non-germinating dwarfs and two germinating dwarfs were selected to
investigate the ent-kauene synthesizing capacity in order to determine
possible limiting steps in the GA viosynthetic pathway of the
GA-sensitive dwarf mutants. The ( 14C)-ent-kaurene formation from (
14C)-vevalonate in cell-free preparations from siliquae was carried
out according to the procedures described previously (Barendse, 1981).<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

Siliquae were chosen as source material for the cell-free
preparations, since it is well-known that developing seeds are active
sites of GA biosynthesis.<p>

Preliminary experiments with cell-free preparations from immature
siliquae harvested between 10 to 15 days after pollination showed,
however, still relative low levels of ent-kaurene formation and
consequently also small but consistent differences between wild type
and dwarfs mutants, the latter possessing a lower ent-kaurene
synthesizing capacity.<p>

In order to investigate whether more active stages existed with regard
to ent-kaurene formation, siliquae of the wild type were harvested and
tested at several stages after pollination.<p>

Table 1: The ent-kaurene synthesizing capacity of cell-free extract
from siliquae of the wild type at different stages after pollination.<p>

The results of Table 1 show that particularly cell-free enzyme
preparations from very young siliquae possess a high ent-kaurene
synthesizing capacity. This 4-5 day old siliquae of all genotypes were
used in subsequent experiments. The three non-germinating mutants were
treated with a 10E-5M GA 4/GA 7 solution to induce germination and
they were subsequently sprayed with an 10E-4M GA 4/GA 7 solution for
further development 3 and 4 weeks after germination. The results of
two consecutive experiments are compiled in Table 2.<p>

Table 2: Ent-kaurene synthesizing capacity of cell-free preparations
from 4-5 day old siliquae of wild type and 5 GA sensitive mutants.<p>

The results of Table 2 demonstrate that the non-germinating mutants
have a significant lower ent-kaurene synthesizing capacity compared
with the wild type whereas the capacity of the germinating mutants is
only slightly less than in the wild type. These results indicate that
in the ga-1 mutant the GA pathway is nearly completely blocked at some
step before ent-kaurene synthesis. The ga-2 and ga-3 mutants have a
low ent-kaurene synthesizing capacity which may indicate either a low
rate of overall GA biosynthesis or a rate limiting step before
ent-kaurene.<p>

In the germinating mutants ga-4 and ga-5 the GA biosynthesis pathway
is either inhibited beyond the ent-kaurene or biologically less active
gibberellins are synthesized.<p>

Preliminary experiments with regard to the determination of endogenous
GA content of these mutants were inconclusive due to the low yield of
GA-like activities of the extracts. Nevertheless, such extractions
seem to indicate that the germinating mutants ga-4 and ga-5 do contain
gibberellin-like substances, while extracts of the nongerminating
mutants ga-1, ga-2 and ga-3 apparently lack gibberellin-like
activities. These results will have to be further substantiated.<p>
