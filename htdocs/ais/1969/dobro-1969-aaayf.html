In an earlier communication (DOBROVOLNA, 1968), an attempt was done to
estimate the heritability of two developmental characters in a natural
population by means of the offspring-parent regression coefficient.
This procedure required to grow both mother plants and their progenies
in strictly the same experimental conditions.  This necessity is
sometimes difficult to ensure (cf. BARTHELMESS, 1964).<p>

Another appropriate method which lacks these difficulties and which
can give valuable results by analyzing only one generation is based on
the calculation of the intraclass correlation coefficient, W.  In such
simple situations the W values correspond directly to the required
coefficients of heritability.<p>

For this purpose, progeny lines derived from single plants of six
natural populations, Bo-1, Dou, He-2, Kr-4, Pi, and Str (cf.
DOBROVOLNA, 1967) were studied at 25+/-3*degrees*C under continuous
illumination of 1250 lux.  Three developmental characters were scored
in individual progeny plants: the number of days to appearance of the
flower primordia (X), the number of rosette leaves (Y), and the number
of rosette leaves per day (Y/X) or the "leaf formation rate" according
to CETL (1966).  In the population Str it was possible to compare the
results with those obtained by means of the offspring-parent
regression (DOBROVOLNA, 1968).<p>

In estimating heritability with the aid of the intraclass correlation
coefficient the following formula was used (modified according to LE
ROY, 1966): where VB and VW are the between and within progeny
variances, and n the average number of plants per progeny.
&#207;urthermore, the standard errors (sw) and the reliability intervals
were calculated.<p>

Table 1 : The values of intraclass correlation coefficient, its
standard error and reliability interval (p=0..05) for the three
developmental characters X, Y, and Y/X in different natural
populations<p>

The results show that in the character X the values were from 0.53 to
0.69, in the character Y from 0.51 to 0.73, and in the character Y/X
from 0.34 to 0.70, respectively.  These figures appear to be well
comparable with those obtained by the offspring-parent regression
method in the population Str as it can be seen from the comparison
with the cited paper (DOBROVOLNA, 1968).<p>

The results confirm that in the populations studied the heritability
of the three developmental characters is relatively high and that the
used method provides a remarkable simplification of the procedure in
estimating heritability in natural populations of Arabidopsis.<p>
