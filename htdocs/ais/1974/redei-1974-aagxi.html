Arabidopsis is a facultative long-day plant.  It does not have a
critical day-length yet under continuous illuminations flower
diffrentiation proceeds much faster than under natural daylight
periods (LAIBACH 1951). Several induced mutants show differences in
their photoperiodic response (REDEI 1962) and for some
5-bromodeoxy-uridine, an antimetabolite, may be substituted for long
light cycles to accelerate flowering (BROWN 1972, HIRONO and REDEI
1966).<p>

On soil or on agar medium Arabidopsis does not grow in total darkness
even if a carbohydrate source is provided aseptically through the
roots.  In submerged culture (REDEI 1972) using 5-10 ml medium per
seedling, in the presence of 0.1-2% glucose or sucrose, prolonged
growth can be maintained in the total absence of light.  The seed is
imbibed in the dark for 12-18 hrs, then exposed to day light for 1 hr,
followed by total darkness for the rest of the experiment, under such
conditions the plants develop flower buds, flowers and fruits
sometimes with macroscopically well visible seed initials.  The time
required for flowering in the dark is somewhat longer than in
continuous light.  If flower initiation is measured, however, by the
number of leaves formed before the differentiation of flower
primordia, very little difference can be seen between flowering in
continuous light and dark culture.  In total darkness thus flowering
takes place early, while under short days flower formation is much
delayed whether measured by time or number of vegetative leaves.  In
darkness the wildtype and the late flowering mutants flower with
little difference.  Under 89 hours daily light regimes, two of the
mutants fail to flower in 120 or more days while they form flower buds
within a month in the dark.<p>

On the basis of these experiments, the conclusion appears obvious that
in the long-day plant Arabidopsis, light is not required for flowering
and shorter daily periods of illumination can effectively prevent this
process of differentiation.<p>
