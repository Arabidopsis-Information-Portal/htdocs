Description: 
 
THE EPIGENETIC CONTROL OF PLANT MALE GAMETOPHYTE AND 
GERMLINE DEVELOPMENT 
Postdoctoral Research Associate 
Salary Grade 7 - £28,289 to £32,796 per annum 
Available immediately for 36 months. 
Ref: R3640 
 
Applications are invited for a 3-year BBSRC-funded postdoctoral position to 
investigate the role and diversity of small RNA (sRNA) pathways that operate 
in the epigenetic control of gene expression during male gametophyte and 
male germline development. The project forms part of a collaboration with 
the University of Oxford (Prof. Hugh Dickinson) and offers the opportunity 
to join a leading research group working on the mechanisms regulating cell 
division and cell fate determination during male reproductive development in 
Arabidopsis. 
 
Applicants should have a PhD in molecular genetics, biochemistry or a 
related discipline. Experience in molecular techniques, bioinformatics and 
cell imaging would be of particular value.
