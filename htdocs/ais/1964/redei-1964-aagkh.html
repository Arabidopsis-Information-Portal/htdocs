Vol 01:<h2>REDEI, G. P.</h2><h2>An attempt to analyse the genetic fine structure of chromosomes</h2>

Electronmicroscopic studies reported from various laboratories
indicate that the chromosomes of higher organisms contain several (up
to 128) strands of deoxyribonucleic acid.  In bacteriophage it is
estimated that about 40 percent of the DNA is genetically active.  It
is not known, however, how much of the DNA of the cells of the higher
organisms carries genetic information.  If several of the multiple
strands are genetically active we may expect sectors, variegation by
the sorting out of mutated elements in mitosis.  Variegation in
somatic cells really can be observed both spontaneously and after
treatment with chemical mutagens.  If transversal multiplicity of the
genetic strands is a reality we may expect delayed appearance of
mutation especially after treatment with delicate agents.  Bromouracil
as a possibly appropriate mutagen has been chosen to test this
hypothesis.  The analogue has been incorporated into the agar medium
and five consecutive generations were examined for somatic variegation
or mutation. The summary result of the experiments is the following.<p>

The data so far obtained do not allow very definite conclusions.
There is no direct evidence that bromouracil is incorporated into the
nucleus though this seems likely.  It appears, however, that
bromouracil is not highly mutagenic; the mutations observed in later
generations are apparently not due to delayed segregation but rather
to spontaneous mutation.  Although the DNA may be arranged in multiple
parallel strands apparently only one helix carries genetic information
or any change in one of the "transversely multiple genes" has the same
effect as an alteration of the entire bundle.<p>
