<I>Arabidopsis thaliana</I> modifies the composition of its 
photosynthetic apparatus in response to growth under lights of 
differing intensities and/or spectral qualities.  It is 
assumed that such acclimation benefits a plant by maximising 
light capture and optimising light use efficiency (Anderson 
and Osmond 1987; Chow <I>et al.</I> 1990).  One response of 
Arabidopsis to light quality is to modify the stoichiometries 
of the two photosynthetic reaction centres; growth under white 
(W) light (400 micro mol quanta m-2 s-1) leads to a PSII/PSI ratio 
of 1.32\0.24, while a similar intensity of far red-enriched 
(FRE) light gives significantly increased levels of PSII 
(PSII/PSI = 2.10\0.50); PSI levels are not appreciably 
affected by this change in light quality (Walters and Horton 
1994). <P>

It is believed that this response has adaptive benefit because 
of the differing absorption characteristics of the two 
photosynthetic units, PSI absorbing more strongly in the red 
and short-wavelength blue regions of the spectrum (due to its 
high levels of Chl a), PSII absorbing strongly at wavelengths 
absorbed by Chl b and carotenoids, particularly xanthophylls.  
However, there is only limited evidence for any  such adaptive 
benefit:  Chow <I>et al.</I> (1990) showed that the quantum 
efficiency of photosynthesis for peas is highest when they are 
exposed to a light source with similar spectral 
characteristics to that in which they are grown. We have 
probed photosynthesis in leaves and thylakoids of Arabidopsis 
plants grown under two different light sources to investigate 
how changes in the composition of the photosynthetic apparatus 
affect its function, and to shed light on how photosystem 
stoichiometry affects photosynthetic performance. <P>

The figure shows measurements of oxygen evolution from leaves 
of plants grown in white or FR-enriched lights when exposed to 
two experimental light sources with markedly different 
spectral qualities:  a white light regime similar to the white 
growth lights; and a regime enriched in red wavelengths 
preferentially absorbed by PSI.  There was no significant 
effect of growth conditions or experimental light source on 
the maximum photosynthetic rate, but there were significant 
differences between the apparent quantum yield of oxygen 
evolution, depending on the light source used .  When measured 
as the slope after linear regression of the plot oxygen 
evolution rate (micro mol O2 (mg Chl)-1 hr-1) versus irradiance 
(micro mol quanta m-2 s-1), quantum yield was very similar in W 
(1.34) and FRE (1.32) plants when they were exposed to "white" 
light.  However, both W and FRE plants showed an increase in 
the apparent quantum yield when illuminated using the red-
enriched light; the increase in the apparent quantum yield was 
appreciably greater in plants grown in FRE light (1.32 to 
1.85), compared to W plants (1.34 to 1.57), indicating that 
the photosynthetic apparatus of FRE plants was able to make 
more effective use of longer wavelength light than that of W 
plants.  Simultaneous measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence 
and absorption changes at 820 nm (not shown) indicated that 
differences between plants grown under alternative light 
regimes can be ascribed to altered excitation rates for  PSI 
and PSII; growth in an altered light environment therefore 
leads to imbalances in photosystem excitation, leading to 
reduced photochemical efficiency.  <P>

Investigation of PSI and PSII function by measuring 
chlorophyll fluorescence emission and excitation spectra at 
77 K (not shown) provides strong evidence that 
there is little or no difference in the composition or 
function of PSI or PSII between the two sets of plants.  This 
implies that changes in photosynthetic stoichiometry are 
primarily responsible for the observed differences in 
photosynthetic function - i.e. the changes in photosystem 
stoichiometry have a direct adaptive benefit. <P>
