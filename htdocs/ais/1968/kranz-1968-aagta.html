<h2>The fixation of radiation energy during the development in chlorophyll b deficient mutants of Arabidopsis</h2><p>

(Institute of Botany, University of Frankfurt-M., Germany)<p>

The still unknown function of the chlorophyll b has been discussed in
the new research work about the two sensibilization systems for the
light reactions I and II of the photosynthesis (ARNON et al., 1964;
WITT, 1966).  But certain chlorophyll b deficient mutants of Chlorella
have evidentially the ability of normal photosynthesis (METZNER et
al., 1965; WILD and EGLE, 1967), although there is a deficiency of
starch production at least in some cases of Pisum (MULLER, 1964).<p>

Table 3: Ranges of the genotypes, radiation qualities and ontogenetic
stages in running time, energy and pigment value.<p>

Starting from these results we have been interested in the problem of
the radiation energy fixation during the ontogenetic dry matter
production in three quantitative chlorophyll b deficient mutants of
Arabidopsis.  We are grateful to Profs. REDEI and ROBBELEN for seeds
of the genetic material we have used.<p>

Our experiments were carried out under constant climatic conditions
(see Tabel 1) in the three radiation ranges produced with plexiglass
filters: normal (~300-800 nm) and red (~600-800 nm). This results in a
gradual elimination of the radiation energy within the region of the
leaf pigment absorption, whereas at the phytochrome action peaks (660
and 730 nm) the energy is not changed (see table 2).  Thus the
phytochrome system can function normally (HOCK and MOHR, 1965;
RUDOLPH, 1965)<p>

Here the gained results shall be presented briefly in a range
comparison statistically tested by SPEARMAN's range correlation. As
shown in Table 3 all the analyzed characters - the running time of
development, the energy values of the dry matter, and the leaf
pigments - increase with progressive ontogenesis. During the ripening
of the husks and the flowering only chlorophyll b and carotenoid
contents decrease. The various radiation qualities cause the expected
decrease of the developmental time from red to yellow and to normal,
while the energy values are increasing except for the calories per
gram of dry weight and dm2 of leaf area. The pigment values rise as
expected with increasing normalization of the radiation quality but
there is no essential difference in chlorophyll b content under red or
yellow light. The three monogenic mutants of the ch-locus show the
known range order in the chlorophyll b content: ch+>>>>ch2~ch3>ch1
(ROBBELEN and VELEMINSKY, 1965).  But there is another order of the
mutants in the six remaining characters. The values of calories per
gram, chlorophyll and carotenoids indicate the order ch+>ch1>ch2>ch3.
The other characters deviate from this order.<p>

In accordance to HIRONO and REDEI (1963) we have detected an equal
amount of assimilation starch in the leaf parenchym chloroplasts of
the mutant ch1 which shows after thin layer chromatographic separation
under the UV-lamp absolutely no chlorophyll b in all ontogenic stages.
The apparent radiation energy used as defined by the author (KRANZ,
1968) runs up to ~1 p.c. like in other annual higher plants and this
character is positively correlated with the values of the chlorophyll
a and the carotenoids.<p>

Summarizing, we may state that there is no proved genetic and
ontogenetic correlation between chlorophyll b and the fixation of the
radiation energy in the dry matter.  Whenever the analyzed genotypes
would only differ in their alleles within the ch-locus (LEE-CHEN and
STEINITZ-SEARS, 1967) they would cause a specifically pleiotropic
action on the remaining characters studied in this paper.  Then we
could postulate there is on the one hand the main effect of the
ch-locus on the chlorophyll a -- and the carotenoid synthesis, the
calorie value p.g. and the time of development, and on the other hand
the secondary effects on the chlorophyll b content and the other
calorie values.  The interaction of the phytochrome system with the
studied reactions of characters may be eliminated on account of the
arranged radiation conditions.<p>
