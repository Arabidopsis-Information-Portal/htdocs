POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN GENOMIC ANALYSES OF THE REGULATORY 
NETWORK OF FLOWER DEVELOPMENT IN ARABIDOPSIS
Riechmann Laboratory
Center for Research in Agricultural Genomics (CRAG), CSIC-IRTA-UAB
08970 Barcelona, Spain


A postdoctoral position is available at the new Center for Research in 
Agricultural Genomics (CRAG) in Barcelona, Spain, to study the gene 
regulatory network that controls flower development in Arabidopsis, using 
novel genomic technologies. The successful candidate will be expected to 
participate in, build on, and lead projects that include: the identification and 
characterization of additional network components, such as novel coding 
short Open Reading Frames (sORFs); the identification of in vivo target sites 
and downstream genes of some of the transcription factors that regulate 
flower development; and reverse genetic experiments. The work provides 
opportunities to develop and enhance skills in molecular and plant biology, 
genomic technologies, genetics, and computational biology.

The CRAG provides excellent research opportunities, and will relocate in 
2009 to a brand new building and state-of-the-art facilities in the campus of 
the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB).  Barcelona offers a high 
quality of life, a rich international atmosphere, and diverse cultural and 
recreational activities.

The position is available beginning September 1st , or afterwards, but before 
the end of the year. The appointment is for two years, but it is funded for a 
third year extension, subject to evaluation of progress.

Applicants should have a recent PhD degree, and strong molecular biology 
research experience. Applicants with experience in Arabidopsis genetics and 
cell biology, and/or genomic technologies, are especially encouraged to 
apply. English language skills are essential, but knowledge of Spanish is not 
a requirement.

Apply to: José Luis Riechmann (jose.riechmann@ibmb.csic.es).  Please write 
the acronym “ARAFDEV” in the subject line.  Applicants are requested to 
submit a curriculum vitae (resumé), a letter describing research interests, 
experience, and career goals, and the names and addresses (including e-
mail addresses) of three references.

The new Center for Reasearch in Agricultural Genomics (CRAG), located in 
the city of Barcelona, results from an association formed by the CSIC (the 
largest multi-disciplinary research institution in Spain, www.csic.es), IRTA 
(the agro-alimentary research institute of the Autonomous Government of 
Catalonia, www.irta.es), and the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona
