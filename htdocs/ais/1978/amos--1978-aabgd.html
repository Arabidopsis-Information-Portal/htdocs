Previous reports of successful anther culture of A. thaliana have been
limited to only a few of the many available ecological races
(Gresshoff and Doy, 1972). The current study reports the induction of
haploid callus from anthers of several new ecotypes. Additionally,
successful anther culture of three related Arabidopsis species, A.
griffithiana (n=16), A. korshinskyi (n=24) and A. pumila (n=16), is
reported.<p>

1. Anther culture of A. thaliana<p>

A preliminary factorial experiment was performed in order to compare
the response of anthers from several races to three basal media
supplemented with exogenous hormones (IAA, 6 mg/l; 2, 4-D, 2 mg/l;
kinetin, 1.5 mg/l). Additionally, anthers were cultured on these media
in the absence of exogenous growth factors to determine if haploid
embryoids could be easily induced.<p>

The basal media used included two that had previously yielded
favorable results for this species, "DBM1" (Gresshoff and Doy, 1972)
and Murashige and Skoog's (1962) "MS" medium. Also, Nitsch and
Nitsch's (1969) "N" medium, originally designed for embryoid
production in tobacco, was employed. Anthers were cultured according
to the method of Gresshoff and Doy (1972).<p>

No callus or plantlets were produced by any of the treatments lacking
hormones. Five of the six races cultured on media supplemented with
hormones produced callus from anthers on all media tested (Table 1).
The average response to each basal medium was similar (analysis of
variance not shown).<p>

callus on three induction media supplemented with growth hormones.<p>

Significantly variability among races on the individual media,
however, was detected. This variability appeared to be highest on
Nitsch and Nitsch's medium and lowest on DBM1. Thus, hormonal
composition of the nutrient medium appears to be the most important
factor in anther induction in A. thaliana. Based on these results,
DBM1 was used as the basal medium in all further anther culture
studies with Arabidopsis. To further investigate the effect of race on
success of anther culture, a second study was performed in which 150
anthers from each of four races (Berlin-Dahlem, Bensheim, Estland,
Wassilewskija) were cultured on DBM1. Anther callus was produced by
all races at induction frequencies ranging between 43 (Berlin-Dahlem)
and 87 (Bensheim) percent. These induction frequencies are
significantly higher than those obtained in the preceding experiment.
These differences may be due to improvements in technique since anther
tissue is easily damaged during all phases of excision and culture,
and such damage may interfere with success of anther culture. Mean
chromosome numbers from a representative sample of anther callus from
each race, determined using the method of Steinitz-Sears(1963), were
very close to five although five percent of the calluses were
apparently diploid, and considerable aneuploidy was observed. Four of
the nine races successfully cultured in the study (Berlin-Dahlem,
Bensheim, Schisdra, Wachkuppel) had not been previously found to
produce callus from anters (Gresshoff and Doy, 1972). Age of donor
plants is one factor that could account for these discrepancies since
it is known to influence haploid embryoid production in Nicotiana
(Kasperbauer and Collins, 1974).<p>

2. Anther culture of related Arabidopsis species<p>

The author knows of no previous reports of tissue culture of A.
griffithiana, A. korshinskyi and A. pumila. Preliminary studies of
diploid culture of these species indicated that DBM1 media supports
callus growth. Anthers from each species were cultured on DBM1 medium
as well as on several modified media chosen on the basis of their
ability to induce and support diploid callus induced from germinated
seedlings (Table 2).<p>

Another cultue of elated Arabidopsis species<p>

The author knows of no previous reports of tissue cultue of A.
griffithiana, A. korshinskyi and A. pumila. Preliminary studies of
diploid culture of these species indicated that DBM1 media supports
callus growth. Anthers from each species were cultured on DBM1 medium
as well as on several modified media chosen on the basis of their
ability to induce and support diploid callus induced from germinated
seedlings (Table 2).<p>

Another callus was successfully induced in each of these species,
although at lower mean rates in comparison with A. thaliana. The use
of modified media in some cases increased anther induction frequencies
although most differences were slight. Cytological analysis of all
anther calluses produced yielded the following mean chromosome
numbers: A. griffithiana, 15.6; A. korshinskyi, 22.2; A. pumila, 15.6
No diploids were found. Thus, anther callus of these species
originated from haploid tissue and was predominantly haploid at the
end of the first passage in culture.<p>
