Although Arabidopsis thaliana has been advocated as a suitable species
for somatic cell genetic studies (Redei, 19785), the isolation and
culture of protoplasts from Arabidopsis have so far met only limited
success. Callus formation from protoplasts at a low frequency (0.1%)
was reported by Gresshoff (1976). Gleba et al. (1978) described
conditions in which they obtained high plating efficiencies (30 to
80%) with protoplasts from callus cultures of an albino mutant. Using
the same medium to culture wildtype protoplasts, plating efficiencies
were much lower (up to 9%) in our experiments. Further modifications
of Gamborg's medium B5, however, have led to the development of a new
medium in which wildtype protoplasts divide at reproducibly high
frequencies.<p>

Protoplats were prepared from fast growing suspension cultures of
Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) HEYNH. race Columbia, grown in Gamborg's B5
medium (1968) containing 1 mg/l 2, 4-D, 0.2 mg/l kinetin and 30 g/l
glucose. 3-day old suspensions were treated with 1% cellulase R10,
0.25% macerozyme R10 and 0.5% driselase dissolved in hormone-free B5
medium containing 0.4M sucrose (25*degrees*C, 5 hours in the dark).
The protoplasts were collected by floating them to the meniscus (100 x
g, 3 minutes) and purified by repeated washing with W5 solution (9.0 n
NaCl, 1.0 g glucose, 18.4 g CaCl 2 x 2H x0 and 0.4 g KCl pr liter).<p>

Protoplasts were first cultured in liquid medium in the dark
(25*degrees*C, 4 days), then diluted two fold by adding fresh medium
containing 1.2% agar (DIFCO) and transferred to dim light (800-1000
lux). Culture media were based on Gamborg's B5 solution with elevated
levels of CaCl2. In order to improve plating efficiencies, the osmotic
stabilizers and growth regulators were varied. The most successful
combinations are shown in Table 1. Of the combinations tried, 1 mg/l
2, 4-D and 0.15 mg/l benzyladenine proved to be the best and 0.4 or
0.5M glucose alone were superior to the original mannitol-glucose
combination (Gleba et al., 1978). The initial protoplast density
influenced the plating efficiency as expected. The highest values were
obtained at 3 x 10 5 protoplast/ml.<p>

About 40% of the protoplast derived calli formed shoots on Gamborg's
B5 medium containing 1 mg/l indole-3-acetic acid, 0.1 mg/l
benzyladenine and 3% glucose. Rooting of the shoots on hormone-free
medium is in progress.<p>
