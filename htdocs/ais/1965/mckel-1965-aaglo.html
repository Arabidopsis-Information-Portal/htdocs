Vol 01S: <h2>Preliminary Data on Linkage Groups in Arabidopsis</h2><p>

A. D. McKELVIE<p>

Following the list of mutant genes published by McKELVIE (1962), an
attempt was made to assess the degree of linkage between some of the
genes. Segregation data were evaluated from crosses between the
following mutants:<p>

Many crosses were made between different mutants, the F1 generations
were selfed and segregation counted in the F2 generation.
Recombination was measured by the product method. The table below
shows the results of the crosses between those mutants which gave
evidence of linkage. Out of the 190 mutant genes listed, only the
forementioned 24 showed any evidence of linkage. But because of the
few crosses made and the large numbers of genes described, it is
probable that many more genes would show linkage if further crosses
were carried out.<p>

The provisional linkage grouping, as shown on Figure 1, indicates one
large group with many genes. The position of these genes can be
established with some degree of accuracy because they have been
positioned as the result of several crosses. The other three groups
are small and provisional; there is insufficient evidence for group 2
to indicate any distances between genes, while groups 3 and 4 contain
only two genes each and may not be separate groups.<p>

Attempts are being made with the aid of trisomics to accelerate the
mapping of the linkage groups and to relate them to individual
chromosomes.<p>

Discussion:<p>

ROBBELEN: You have, Dr. RATCLIFFE, kindly demonstrated several slides
of McKELVIE's mutant plants, but only one presented a gene of the
linkage table. I think, however, it would be necessary to have those
pictures and mutants available, with which linkage studies have been
done. And secondly the names, which McKELVIE gave to his mutants is
surely different from that which REDEI uses for the same phenotypes.
Mutant im of REDEI surely would be termed different by McKELVIE and
this will give much confusion, of course. The mutant im of REDEI may
be vi in the first linkage group on point 70 in the list of McKELVIE.<p>

REDEI: I don't think that I have any such long linkage group as Dr.
McKelvie shows. I have actually 6 linkage groups, we would of course
expect only 5. This shows the mapping situation today in Arabidopsis.
However, it may be, that these 6 linkage groups cover only 3
chromosomes. The maximal distance between two of my markers is not
more than about 40 map units. It is actually a very short map.  Most
of the markers are crowded. Probably some of them are chromosomal
aberrations, and crossing over is suppressed. It is interesting, that
Dr. McKELVIE has one linkage group with many markers and the others
are short. My experiences are similar, though my longest mapped region
is much shorther than that of Dr. McKELVIE.<p>

RATCLIFFE: I can't make any suggestions on these things, of course.<p>

REDEI: I would like to see, if some other people would be interested
in mapping. One man cannot do this alone, this is a tedious job; and
sometimes relatively little appreciation is given for the very
important efforts which are done here. Good genetic tests are feasible
only when you have chromosome maps, otherwise you cannot really test
anything. We should encourage Dr. McKELVIE to continue this important
work. May be we should do what the members of the Corn Geneticists
Cooperative do; several people are working only with definite
chromosome regions and systematically complete linkage information.
May be we would find at least 5 volunteers to do that!<p>

ROBBELEN: "Arabidopsis Information Service" will be pleased to publish
these informations!<p>

LANGRIDGE: What about aneuploid analysis in Arabidopsis?<p>

REDEI: Nullisomic analysis is, of course, impossible because
Arabidopsis is a diploid plant. But we did some trisomic analysis and
tried to correlate chromosomes with linkage groups. But we did not get
far as yet. I should like to see the correspondence between
chromosomes and linkage groups. The trisomics are not hard to identify
by phenotype, though they cannot be identified in all backgrounds. Dr.
Lotti SEARS found one which has leaves somewhat similar to the
cordifolia type which Dr. REINHOLZ described this morning. We have
another which has a more serrated leaf margin. In the third the
transition of the leaf base to the petiol is very gradual. These 3
trisomics are fairly clear.<p>

Van der VEEN: A similar technique may be used with plants which are
"partly monosomic" in having a deletion in one chromosome.<p>

REDEI: If the particular region would not contain important genes this
would surely work. But I don't know how far you could get, because if
you would delete any considerable length of the chromosome the plants
would not live.<p>

ROBBELEN: This technique, however, would probably answer the question
whether a chromosome which contains many markers, would be more
sensitive to loss than another without an appreciable number of
markers.  For example in wheat, there are some chromosomes with a lot
of known markers (IX, XVI, XXI) which seem to be of lower vital
necessity than the chromosomes I to V where only a few markers have
been found. I wonder whether those chromosomes, where we have plenty
of markers, don't govern vital processes, while those which are
varying are not so important.<p>

BROWN: I should like to make another comment, and that is to say that
the amount of work involved in the maintenance of these mutants and
the making of crosses is very impressive, and Dr. McKELVIE and Dr.
REDEI are to be congratulated on this effort. Perhaps in a later
session we could have Dr. REDEI speak on how to organize time, space
and assistance for this work.<p>

REDEI: Actually I must admit, in the last time I did not much to
complete linkage data, because I do not have the time and the
technicians for that. But one should do this work. The paper which I
will present tomorrow, shows the usefullness of such information. If
we had not such chromosome markers, we could not do anything.<p>
