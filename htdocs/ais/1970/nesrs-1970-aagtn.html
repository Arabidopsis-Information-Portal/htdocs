In the race Dijon G and in its eight monogenic recessive mutants (see
CETL, DOBROVOLNA, and NESRSTA, 1969) 15 physiological and
morphological characters were studied in three environments differing
widely in daylength and light intensity. The effects of genotypes,
environments, replications and corresponding interactions were studied
by means of a factor analysis of variance. Complete results will be
published elsewhere.<p>

Table: "Macro-environmental" (a) and "micro-environmental" (b)
variability coefficients in the race Dijon G and its mutants<p>

In 6 leaf characteristics (length of whole leaf; length of petiole;
width of leaf blade; length of leaf blade; length/width of leaf blade;
length of pitiole/length of whole leaf) the variances due to
environments and to replications estimated in all nine genotypes were
transferred to variability coefficients so that comparable amounts of
both "macro-environmental" and "micro-environmental" variation, could
be measured.<p>

As it could be expected the "macro-environmental" variation was
considerably higher than the "micro-environmental" one.  It seems that
there is no clear correlation between the quantities of these two
components.  For the mutant qn, e.g., very high values of the
"macro-environmental" variability were characteristic, while as to the
amount of the "micro-environemntal" one this mutant appeared to be
less variable.<p>

Among the characteristics studied both indexes (length/width of leaf
blade, length of petiole/length of whole leaf) showed low values of
both components. This means that the indexes represent relatively
stable quantities. As the mutants studied differ mostly in the leaf
shape (e.g., the mutants gr and rf have roundish leaves, while aut,
dl, and ln have oblong ones), just the most typical character was
found to be one of the least variable.<p>

On the other hand, there were conspicuous differences also among the
genotypes.  One of the most stable genotypes was the initial race
Dijon G.  Also the mutant gr showed very low "macro-environmental" and
"micro-environmental" variability.  The other mutants appeared to be
phenotypically far less stable in almost all characters studied.<p>

The larger phenotypical stability of the initial race Dijon G as
compared to the majority of the mutants studied, suggests that one of
the typical consequences of mutation is the decrease of the
developmental homeostasis.<p>
