PhD student to work on a Swiss National Foundation supported project

I am looking for a dedicated and enthusiastic PhD student to work on a Swiss National Foundation 
supported project investigating tissue specific epigenetic codes in plants. 

As a PhD student in the Bucher lab, you'll have the opportunity to apply cutting-edge genomics and 
learn a variety of molecular techniques (such as DNA methylation and siRNA analysis and many more). 

The project will focus on: 
(a) Identifying Arabidopsis mutant plants with perturbed epigenetic regulation of transcription in 
specific tissues. This will be done by screening for Arabidopsis mutants that show altered GFP 
expression. 
(b) Mapping of selected mutants by next-gen whole genome sequencing assisted by classical mapping. 
(c) Characterizing the transcriptome of those mutants using high-density tiling arrays. 

Necessary qualifications include: 

(1) MSc or equivalent in molecular biology 
(2) Practical experience at the bench 
(3) Prior experience with Arabidopsis is NOT required 

The position is available starting on the 1st of February 2011. Your working place will be at the 
Botanical Institute in the old town of the beautiful city of Basel in Switzerland
