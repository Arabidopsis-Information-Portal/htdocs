INTRODUCTION<p>

The only plant genes that have been isolated so far, have been cloned
by the cDNA method. However, this method is mainly suitable to obtain
genes which are expressed at relatively high levels or the protein
product of which has been purified, so as to allow preparations of
antibodies. Our aim was to study the genes coding for the biosynthesis
of amino acids in plants, which do not meet the above requirements.
For such genes a system permitting the recovery of genomic clones by
complementation of a compatible eukaryotic host would be valuable. We,
therefore, investigated whether it would be possible to express plant
DNA by transforming system and auxotrophic mutants are available,
namely the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.<p>

We constructed a cosmid gene bank of A. thaliana which we have used to
transform different yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) mutants affected
in the arginine and leucine metabolism. We chose to work with A.
thaliana because, with a DNA content of 2.10 5 kb (kilobase pairs) per
haploid genome, it has one of the smallest genomes among higher plants
(Bennet and Smith, 1976).<p>

Table 1: List of used E. coli, A. thaliana and S. cerevisiae strains
and cosmid<p>

This, together with the cosmid cloning strategy, allows to reduce the
number of independent clones necessary to produce a representative
gene library. We uded the yeast as receptor because i) it is amenable
to efficient transformation, ii) it is a eukaryote which is well known
at the molecular level and of which many mutants are available, iii)
the ADE8 gene of Drosophila melanogaster has been cloned by
complementation of a ade8 yeast mutant (Henikoff et al., 1981), iv)
some yeast genes, for example the actin gene, contain introns (SHAH et
al., 1982) like the higher eukaryotes.<p>

In this paper we describe the construction of an Arabidopsis gene bank
and the attempts which were made to complement various yeast mutations
by transformation with the DNA of this bank.<p>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<p>

Strains and cosmids<p>

See Table 1.<p>

Cosmid DNA Preparation<p>

Cosmid DNA was prepared following the standard plasmid DNA preparation
procedure based on equilibrium centrifugation in CdCl-ethidium bromide
gradients of cleared lysates as described in Crabeel et al. (1979)<p>

A. thaliana DNA preparation<p>

The method was that of Ledoux (personal communication) modified in
order to obtain larger fragments. About 5 sterile grown plants were
crushed to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen with a mortar and a
pestle. The 10 ml of borate buffer were added (50 mM sodium borate, 10
mM EDTA pH 9.15). The resulting paste was mixed with 20 ml ethanol and
centrifuged during 10 min. at 3000 g at 4*degrees*C. The supernatant
was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in 8 ml saline-EDTA
buffer (100 mM EDTA, 1560 mM NaCl, pH 8.0), 1 ml 20% SDS, 1 ml of
pronase solution (20 mg/ml in 10 mM NaCl) and incubated for 30 min. at
37*degrees*C. This suspension was centrifuged as above, the
supernatant containing the DNA was precipitated with 20 ml ethanol and
centrifuged again.<p>

The pellet of cell debris was resuspended and reextracted three times
with saline-EDTA as above. The DNA pellet was dried under vacuum and
resuspended in 8 ml 0.1 x SSC buffer (1xSSC contains 150 mM NaCl and
15 mM sodium citrate pH 7.4).1 ml 10 SSC and 1 ml of RNAse solution
(RNAse 2 mg/ml, NaCl 0.14 M) were then added. The solution was
incubated 1 h at 37*degrees*C. Afterwards, 1 ml proteinase K solution
was added (1 mg/ml in 0.01 M NaCl) and further incubated for 1 h. The
solution was then adjusted to 100 micro g/ml ethidium bromide. The
refractive index was brought to 1.3855 with CsCl and the solution
centrifuged 35 h at 140,000 g and 15*degrees*C in a 50 Ti Beckmann
rotor. The collection of the DNA and the rest of the preparation were
done as described in Crabeel et al. (1979).<p>

Electrophoresis<p>

Electrophoreses were performed in agarose gels of 0.4% or 0.7%
according to the molecular weights of the fragments. Running
conditions were as in Crabeel et al. (1979)<p>

Partial restriction of the A. thaliana DNA<p>

To a 100 micro g/ml DNA solution, 1/8 in volume of low salt buffer (50
mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 100 micro g/ml BSA) and 1/8 in volume of a
solution 1.8 10E-2 Biolabs units/ml of MboI in dilution buffer (75 mM
NaCl, 10 mM Tris, 10 mM MgCl 2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 100 micro g/ml
BSA) were added. The solution was incubated for 30 min. at
37*degrees*C then the enzyme was inactivated by heating at
65*degrees*C for 10 min. The length of the fagments was then checked
by electrophoresis in 0.4% agarose.<p>

Ligation of the vector with A. thaliana DNA<p>

The ligation was made with a 3 to 1 ratio of BamHI vector digested DNA
and A. thaliana DNA at a concentration of 450 micro g/ml of DNA in
ligation buffer (5 mM MgCl 2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM ATP, 50
micro g/ml BSA) and 0.008 Boehringer T4 DNA-ligase units/micro g DNA.
The solution was incubated during 48 h at 4*degrees*C. The 3 to 1
ratio and the high DNA concentration were aimed at obtaining linear
recombinant DNA molecules with plant DNA inserted between the cosmids;
such molecules are indeed substrates for in vitro packaging.<p>

In vitro packaging<p>

The in vitro packaging, preparation of the extracts and transduction
were performed according to HOHN (1979)<p>

Miniextraction of plasmic DNA<p>

The miniextractions were done according to Birnboim and Dolly (1979)<p>

Restriction enzymes<p>

Except for MboI (from Biolabs) all enzymes were pruchased from
Boehringer and used according to the manufactuer's instructions.<p>

Yeast transformations<p>

The transformations were done according to Hinnen et al., (1978).
Media for yeast spheroplasts regeneration were the usual minimal
medium (Ramos and Wiame, 1979) containing 1 M sorbitol, 3% glucose and
3% agar).<p>

Yeast plasmid content analysis<p>

The plasmic DNA was extracted as described in Crabeel et al. (1981).
The DNA was then used to transform E. coli HB 101 (Petes et al., 1978)
and analyzed by miniextraction and restriction.<p>

Glassware<p>

All glassware were sterilized by autoclaving to avoid any
contamination by nucleases.<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

To construct a gene bank of A. thaliana we used the 9.8 kb pYc5 cosmid
from Hinnen and Hohn (personal communication). A derivative of pBR322,
it allows replication in Escherischia coli and confers resistance to
ampicillin and tetracycline. However, the level of tetracycline
resistance was reduced to 10 micro g/ml culture medium due to the
insertion of the URA 3 yeast sequence in the promoter of the tet gene.
As the cosmid also carries a fragment of the 2 micro m yeast plasmid,
it can both replicate and be selected for in this organism. It also
contains the cos sequence of the *lambda* phage allowing for in vitro
packaging of recombinant DNA in *lambda* heads. The plant DNA preparation
yielded fragments of a mean size of 100 kb as estimated by gel
electrophoresis. It was partially digested by MboI to produce
fragments of about 35 kb which could easily be ligated to the pYc5
digested to completion with BamHI due to the complementarity of the
sticky ends generated by both enzymes. The ligation mixture was then
packaged in vitro and the *lambda* heads containing the recombinant DNA
were transduced in E. coli HB 101.<p>

Starting with 10 micro g of A. thaliana DNA we produced 1.2 x 10 5
colonies resistant to amplicillin. Among these colonies, 90% were
tetracycline sensitive and were therefore expected to be hybrid
cosmids since inserting DNA in the BamHI site of the pYc5 disrupts the
Tet R gene. A series of 15 clones sensitive to tetracycline were
miniextacted and digested with HindIII and PstI. All the hybrids were
different and the mean size of the inserted DNA was of 30 kb as
estimated by gel electrophoresis Using the Clarke and Carbon (1975)
formula, it is possible to determine the probability P of finding a
certain gene in function of M, the genome size, L, the mean size of
the inserted fragments, X, the gene size and N, the number of clones
in the bank.<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol19/vol19-pg6-fig0.gif">Click here for figure</a><p>

assuming that M = 2 x 10 5 kb, L = 30 kb, N = 10 5 clones (hybrid
cosmids) and X = 1 kb, we find that P = 99.9999%. So theoretically we
have a representative gene bank of A. thaliana. However, we cannot say
that all sequences have been cloned with the same efficiency and are
all stable. But hybrid cosmid DNA prepared from 6 E. coli clones grown
for 30 generations did not show a decrease in size nor a change of
restriction pattern. Moreover, none of the clones analyzed was found
to be smaller than 35 kb, which is a lower limit of in vitro
packaging.<p>

VOL 19-Page 7-Table 2<p>

Table 2: Yeast mutants affected in arginine or leucine metabolism<p>

Hybrid cosmid DNA prepared from the pooled 1.2 x 10 5 independent
clones was prepared and used to transform several yeast mutans
affected in the metabolism of arginine or leucine (see Table 2)..
Ornithine carbamoyltransferase and argininosuccinate lyase
respectively catalyze the sixth and the seventh steps of arginine
biosynthesis. Carbamoylphosphate synthase provides carbamolyphosphate
for the arginine and pyrimidine pathways. Isopropylmalate
dehydrogenase is the third enzyme of leucine biosynthesis. Arginase is
the first enzyme of the arginine catabolic pathway.<p>

Every transformation performed to select a particular gene was coupled
to the co-selection of URA3, the marker gene present on the cosmid
vector. The receptor strain always bore a triply mutated URA3 gene to
minimize the background of undesired revertants. The efficiency of the
transformation process was followed by selecting only for the recovery
of uracil prototrophy (in the presence of orotate for strain 1C1082a).
For each of the five genes investigated, we tested about 10 5 Ura 3+
transformants. None of these were found to complement the arg3-,
arg4-, or leu2- markers of yeast strains 1C1585c, 1C1144c and 1C1070d.
A few colonies capable of growing on the selective medium were
obtained by transforming strains 1C1082a (ura3-capI cpu-) and 01417d
(ura3- car1-). Several of these colonies were identified as revertants
of the original yeast mutants; nevertheless, one of the Car1+
transformants obtained deserves a more careful analysis which is
presently being conducted.<p>

Although a limited number of genes has been considered in this work,
the results obtained do not indicate an obvious compatibility between
the Arabidopsis genes and yeast transcription-translation apparatus.
In addition, the analysis of the presumed transformants described
above has shown that a high proportion of the hybrid cosmids which can
be reisolated from such yeast transformants are in fact pure pYc5.
This observation might point to the instability of large cosmids in
yeast cells contrarily to previous suggestions (Hohn and Hinnen, 1980,
but in agreement with the recent observation that cloned yeast cosmids
are unstable in yeast (S. Ball. pers. comm.).<p>

A thorough study of the stability of the cosmids in yeast as well as
complementation tests concerning more genes are needed before deciding
that the cloning of Arabidopsis genes cannot be achieved using the
method developed here. An alternative approach to cloning of such
genes might be to use clones genes from other organisms as probe for
isolating the corresponding plant genes from our Arabidopsis library.<p>

SUMMARY<p>

Advantage has been taken of the small size of the genome of A.
thaliana and of the cosmid cloning technique to prepare a
representative gene library of this organism. This library was used to
test the possibility of cloning plant genes by complementation of
yeast mutants. However, when the recombinant DNA was used to transform
several yeast mutants affected in the arginine and leucine metabolism
we could not recover plant sequences correcting the yeast mutant
phenotypes. The gene sample investigated here is admittedly limited
but the results already suggest that no obvious compatibility exist
between Arabidopsis genes and the yeast transcription-translation
apparatus.<p>
