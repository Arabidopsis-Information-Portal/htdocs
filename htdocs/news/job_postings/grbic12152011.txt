seeks highly motivated postdoctoral candidates to work on the genomics of 
plant-pest interaction. 

We are seeking a postdoctoral candidates capable of working independently 
and with previous experience in: 1) plant (tomato/Arabidopsis) biology and 
genetics; 2) arthropod biology/genomics, and 3) bioinformatics. The work 
will be performed between broader consortium members including labs in 
Belgium (Gent), Spain (Madrid & Logrono), Canada (London, ON) and France. 
The ability of travel is essential. The funding for the project is 
available for the next four years.
