3 year PhD Position

One PhD student position is available at the Plant Growth and Development research group, 
University of Antwerp, to study genes that are involved in the elongation of Arabidopsis 
roots. The project will be conducted in collaboration with the lab of Prof. M. Bennett (CPIB, 
Univ. Nottingham, UK). Both labs have documented expertise in this matter and the position 
aims for the continuation of conducted research. The position will include one or two long 
stays in the UK-lab (1 year in total) and two more years in the lab in Antwerp.

The task will be to further explore results obtained by micro-array analysis of Arabidopsis 
roots. This will be done by analysis of knock-out plants and plants overexpressing genes of 
interest, together with an expression analysis of several candidate genes and a subcellular 
localisation of the proteins (using protein-GFP/YFP fusions). This work will integrate into 
ongoing work in both labs.

The successful candidate has a solid background in molecular biology, basic skills in 
microscopy, a deep interest in plant physiology and cell growth, and a nice and collegial 
working spirit.

We are looking for a motivated student with a master degree or equivalent university diploma 
in biology, molecular biology or biochemistry.

Start: from January 2009 on

Duration: 3 years (=1 + 2).
 
Salary: about 1400 Euro/month (depends on qualification and includes taxes and a health-
        Insurance!!)
