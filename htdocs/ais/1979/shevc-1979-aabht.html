It is known that irradiation induces twinning in plants. This
phenomenon was observed after irradiation of wheat flowers and seeds
(Natarajan and Swaminathan, 1958; Okkrimenko, 1976), maize and lily
pollen (Morgan and Rappleye, 1951), A. thaliana flowers (Reinholz,
1959). The aim of this work was to study the rate and the types of
twin plants of A. thaliana following irradiation of different phases
of flower development and to try to determine the way of twin
formation.<p>

A. thaliana plants (race En) were grown in test tubes on minimal agar
medium under continuous illumination at 24 +/- 2*degrees*C. At the
beginning of anthesis the plants were irradiated with 5 kr gamma rays
and the phase of development of every flower was determined.
Morphological and cytological description of the phases was given
earlier (Shevchenko et al., 1978). The seeds were collected separately
from the flowers irradiated at every phase. The rate of twin seedlings
was determined in Petri dishes on minimal agar medium 7 and 13 days
after sowing. A part of twin seedlings was fixed to determine the
chromosome number, the other part was planted in test tubes or soil to
analyze mutations in twins using embryo test and to determine
chromosome numbers by means of counting chromocentres in petal cells.
The material was fixed in alcohol-acetic (3:1), and squashed
acetocarmine preparations were made. The crosses ashy x vcer and glan
x vcer were performed, and in the period from 12 to 16 hours after
pollination the flowers were irradited to induce twinning.<p>

After irradiation of the flowers at meiosis (B3) and embryo sac (B1/4)
stages were found only 1 seed with twins among 4796 seeds. It was the
same rate as in the control (0.02 =/- 0.02%). After irradiation of the
flowers during fertilization stage (B2/4) the rate of twins increased
(0.9+/- 0.23%) and reached the maximum (16.8 +/- 0.80%) after
irradiation at B6 phase at which most of the embryos were at early and
medium globular stages. A sharp decrease of the rate was observed
after irradiation of flowers at B7 phase at which the embryos were at
medium and late globular stages (0.5 +/- 0.20%).<p>

We divided twins into 3 types: I - 2 plants, each of them had 1 shoot
apex (completely separated twins); II - 1 plant with 2 shoot apices
(joint twins), fused in various organs - root, cotyledons, hypocotyl;
III - 2 plants, one of them had 1 shoot apex, the other had 2 apics
(there were both fusion and separation). After irradiation of flowers
at the phases B 2/4 and B5 twins of the type I were predominant (42 of
49 twins), but after irradiation at the phase B6 the number of twins
of each type was almost the same (20, 25 and 25 twins of the types I,
II and III rsp.). After irradiation at the phase B7 all 7 twins found
belonged to the type II.<p>

If the twin plans were produced due to a wrong division of the zygote
or if they derived from one embryo through splitting it is interesting
to find out at which stages of its development the embryo can split
after irradition to form completely separated twin plants. We compared
the share of emryos developed no further than the octant stage after
irradiation at different phases of flower development with the share
of twins of the type I and III induced by irradiation at these phases.
After irradiation at the phase B4 both values were the same (100%),
phase B5- 85.1 +/- 2.04% for embryos and 94.4 =/- 3.88% for twins.
After irradiation at the phase B6 the percentage of twins was 2 times
higher than that of the embryos not developing further than the octant
stage (64.3 +/- 5.76 and 30.7 +/- 2.52%). This points to a possibility
that after irradiation the embryo developed up to the octant stage and
even further they can split producing completely separated twins.<p>

After irradiation of the flowers at the phase B5 and their fixation 24
hours later we found an ovule with 2 embryos in 1 embryo sac (Figure
1) which were both at the octant stage. Their location and the same
stage of development enable us to propose a possible way of their
formation, splitting of the zygote or early proembryo after
irradiation.<p>

After the crossing of the marker lines and subsequent irradiation we
found 4 twins. They all were hybrids. The analysis of mutations in
twin plants showed that in all 7 mutant twins both partners originated
from the same zygote or proembryo since they had identical mutations.
However, the analysis of chromosome number showed that twins could be
produced in another way because among 50 twins analyzed there was one
pair which consisted of diplid and haplid partners while both partners
of other pairs were diploid.<p>
