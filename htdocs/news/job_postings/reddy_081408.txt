Postdoctoral Position 
Department of Biology and Program in Molecular Plant Biology 
Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523 
 
A postdoctoral position is available in the Department of Biology and Program in 
Molecular Plant Biology to study nuclear pre-mRNA processing and its regulation in 
plants. A Ph.D. in plant molecular biology or a related field is required. Applicants must 
have experience in standard biochemical and molecular techniques. Experience with 
functional genomics approaches (reverse genetics, microarrays and proteomics) and 
bioinformatics tools is desirable. The successful candidate will develop and apply new 
and existing techniques to isolate protein complexes involved in pre-mRNA splicing, 
identify components of these complexes using proteomic approaches and identify mRNA 
targets of serine/arginine-rich proteins.  This project will provide opportunities to perform 
global studies using high throughput technologies involving next generation of 
sequencing technologies. The incumbent will have an opportunity to participate in other 
ongoing projects in the laboratory and is expected to interact with other post-docs, 
graduate and undergraduate students in the laboratory. Lab publications in pre-mRNA 
splicing area include: Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 58: 267-294 (2007); Plant J. 49: 1091-1107 
(2007); PLoS ONE, 5: e471, Pages 1-13 (2007); BMC Genomics 10: 9:159; pages 1-11 
(2008); J. Cell Sci. 119: 3527-3538 (2006); Trends in Plant Science 9: 541-547 (2004); 
Plant. J. 36: 883-893 (2003); J. Biol. Chem. 274: 36428-36438(1999); Plant Cell 10: 
1637-1647 (1998); Plant Cell 8: 1421-1435 (1996).  For more information on our

experience.  Please send (preferably by e-mail) curriculum vitae, a brief statement of 
research experience, and three references to:
