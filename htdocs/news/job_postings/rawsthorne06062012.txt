Applications are now open for the Royal Society Research Professorship: a 
prestigious senior funding scheme that provides up to ten years support to 
world-class scientists releasing them from teaching and administration to 
enable them to focus on their research. More information can be found at: 
http://royalsociety.org/grants/schemes/research-professorship/. 

Eligibility requirements 
Applicants can be of any nationality, and applications are particularly 
welcomed from scientists currently resident outside the UK. 
Applicants should ensure that they meet all the eligibility requirements, 
which are explained in the scheme notes 
(PDF)<http://royalsociety.org/uploadedFiles/Royal_Society_Content/grants/schemes/Research-Professorship.pdf>. 

Value and tenure 
The scheme provides salary costs, a one-off start-up grant and research 
expenses. Appointments are usually made for 10 years. 
After this period, all responsibility for the post, financial and 
otherwise, will pass to the host organisation alone. A representative of 
the host organisation will be asked to agree in principle to make this 
commitment, when an application is submitted to the Society.
