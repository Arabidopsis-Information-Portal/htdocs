Seeds of many races of A. thaliana show a period of dormancy which can
be broken by cold-imbibition. Depending on culture and seed storage
conditions the degree of dormancy may vary greatly. The optimum
temperature during imbibition is usually taken to be between 2 and
5*degrees*C (e.g., Redei, 1970 and Stokes, 1965). Rehwaldt (1965)
reported that prolonged imbibition at 7 *degrees*C may increase
germination up to 100%. For a particular batch of seeds of A.
thaliana, we have determined the optimal combination of imbibition
temperature and length of imbibition.<p>

Seeds of wild type A. thaliana were harvested from plants grown in
late summer 1979. They were imbibed in lots of 50 to 100 in small
petri dishes on 5 layers of 4.5 cm diameter filterpaper disks
(Schleicher & Scholl nr. 589 2), moistened with 1.5 ml solution,
containing 0.01 N Na-K-phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) and 0.001 M KNO 3.
The dishes were kept in the dark during the imbibition period. Before
irradiation the dishes were kept for 1 hour at 20*degree*C. The red
dose was 157 JmE-1 at 667 nm (interference filter). Germination
percentages were determined after an additional incubation in the dark
at 20%degrees*C for four days.<p>

Figure 1 shows curves for the percentages germination in relation to
the imbibition temperture and the duration of the imbibition. No
germination in the dark could be observed.<p>

DISCUSSION<p>

The batch of seeds used in the present experiments was originally
considered relatively heavily dormant. As Figure 1 shows, the
development of photo-inducibility of germination can better be
explained as resulting from two temperature sensitive processes with
different activation energies. First, there is an escape from an
innate dormancy (Karssen, 1980) which is broken rapidly at
20*degrees*C. In combination, these two processes result in an optimum
inducibility in the region 5-10*degreesC in a period of 4-7 days<p>
