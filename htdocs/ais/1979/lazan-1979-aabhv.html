<h2>INCREASED PLANT SIZE, HETEROSIS AND TRANSGRESSION, AS CONSEQUENCES OF INDUCED GENE DUPLICATIONS IN ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA (L.) HEYNH</h2><p>

In a previous paper (Lazanyi, 1979) we reported that certain chemical
compounds, which are not able to induce chromosome aberrations and
chlorophyll mutations, can induce in barley some heritable variation
in quantitative characters. We assumed that this variation is due to
the induced geneduplications of the existing polygenes; therefore, the
effect of treatments with such compounds will be more expressed in
Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh., with a relatively small genome (2 mg
DNA per nucleus, Sparrow and Evans, 1961). The importance of
geneduplications in the evolution of the genetic material has been
appreciated by Britten and Kohne (1968)k Ohno, Wolf and Atkin (1968),
Robbelen (1972).a.o.<p>

In the present experiment the V-157 chlorina mutant was used as
initial form. This mutant, obtained from G. Robbelen, may give rise to
revertant normal green sectors, if treated with EMS or X-rays
(Robbelen, 1972). Plants of the V-157 chlorina mutant were treated
with the same mutagens as the barley in the previous experiment
(Lazanyi, 1979). The treatments were repeatedly performed for seven
generations, about ten times in each generation. After a treated
generation, there followed one or two intermediate generations, which
were not treated, in order to select he largest chlorina plant; the
descendants of this were treated forth. (Further details about the
mutagens and treatmens will be reported later. Abbreviations: 1M1= the
first treated generation; 1M2, 1M3= its nontreated descendants; 7M1 =
the seventh treated generation; 7M2, 7M3 = its non treated
descendants). All generations were grown under 16 hrs. daily
artificial light of fluorescens tubes, during the first ten days and
under continuous light for the rest, at room temperature, and in soil
culture.<p>

Figure 1: Gradual increase of the rosette leaves in F1 at the
beginning of flowering.<p>

As a result of treatments, pale-greenish-white mutants appeared in the
1M2 till the 3M2; these mutants died at the state of cotyledons. In
contrast, normal-green mutants appeared continuously in all
generations. Neither morphological nor other types of chlorophyll
mutants appeared during the whole experiment. It is likely, that the
the V-157 chlorina genotype conditioned the appearance of the
pale-greenish-white and normal green mutants, since not any
chlorophyll mutants could be observed after similar treatments in the
descendants of the normal form of Arabidopsis.<p>

From one generation to the other, a gradual increase of the size of
plants was obtained by treatments and directional selection. Figure 1
shows in a comparative trial the rosette leaves, at the beginning of
the flowering. Rosette diameter (mean values of 3 x 12 plants); V-157
chlorina orig. (the initial form) = 3.1 cm; normal form = 4.3 cm; F1
of the cross (normal form [female] x chlorina 7M3 [male]) = 6.2 cm; and
chlorina 7M3 = 5.0 cm.<p>

The fertility of plants from 1M1 to the 7M3 remained normal, thus the
treatments may be continued.<p>

In order to find out whether the characters of the large chlorina 7M3
plants are polygenically inherited, the normal form of Arabidopsis was
crossed with the chlorina 7M3 mutant, this latter being the pollen
donor. In the F1 a marked heterosis was manifest, mainly in the
rosette and stem diameter, flowering time, number of ramifications and
siliquae.<p>

Figure 2: Smallest dwarf chlorina plant and largest normal green plant
in F2.<p>

In the F2 a striking transgression appeared concerning the size of
plants. The segregation pattern of F2 was typical for a cross between
genotypes which differ in many polygenes determining the quantitative
characters of leaves, stems, flowers, and siliquae. The Figure 2
shows, that the smallest dwarf chlorina plant in F2 was smaller than
the V-157 chlorina initial form, while the largest normal green plant
in F2 was 13.7 cm rosette diameter, one main and eight lateral
inflorescences, with 1951 siliquae, - a "gi" mutant much larger than
the F1 and the parents. The descendants of this "gi" mutant showed in
the F3 further segregation, from middling to large plants. In a
comparative trial, the dry mass of the rosette leaves of the largest
G3 plants was 1.9 times larger, than that of the chlorina 7M3 plants.
We are striving by further selection for a homozygous polygenic
gi-genotype.<p>

It is unlikely that by the above treatments point mutations (i.e.
allelic changes) would be induced; the lack of sterility indicates
that neither chromosome aberrations were involved.<p>

The following hypothesis may lead to this possible explanation: 1) the
biological efficiency of a certain polygene is directly proportional
to the number of copies of this gene present in the genome; 2) plant
growth and size are controlled by (at least) two kinds of nonallelic
polygenes; growth promoting genes, named here for simplicity as
"positive" polygenes and genes which have antagonistic action against
the formers, named here as "negative" polygenes; all these genes have
additive effects; 3) most of the positive polygenes are localized in
other chromosomes than the negative polygenes, therefore the two kinds
of polygenes may regroup freely in the meiosis.<p>

By treatments duplications of both positive and negative polygenes
were repeatedly induced and by the directional selection the
favourable duplications were especially accumulated, till the 7M3
genotype was obtained. However, in this genoytpe, besides the many
times duplicated positive polygenes, there occurred duplicated
negative polygenes, too. After the cross with the nontreated normal
form (which is devoid of induced duplications), in the meiosis of the
F1 plants in the most favourable case the chromosomes carrying
duplicated positive polygenes were combined with the chromosomes
having nonduplicated negative polygenes, hereby a transgressive "gi"
plant was produced. A reversed combination determined the
transgressive dwarf plant. Between these extemes the other possible
combinations gave many transitory genotypes.<p>

The hypothesis may be summarized in simbols, as follows (Abbreviations
and symbols: I+p = the first chromosome of the haploid set carrying
the initial positive genes; V-pD = the fifth chromosome carrying many
times duplicated negative polygenes):<p>

Our results demonstrate that an important part of those genetic
factors which determine the plant size, heterosis and transgression
can be controlled by chemical mutagenesis, which in turn may have
appllication in plant breeding.<p>
