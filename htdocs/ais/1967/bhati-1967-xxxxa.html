	Following the publication of a brief report on the esterases of Arabidopsis (BHATIA and SMITH, 1966), some requests were received for details of the procedure used.  Therefore, it was thought that the technique may be of interest to other workers.<p>

	Extraction:  Young leaves were collected, washed and immediately frozen at -20*degrees*C.  Five grams of frozen tissue were used for each extraction.  All subsequent steps were carried out in  a cold room. From green tissues, it is important to get rid of the chlorophylls and other pigments which otherwise interfere with the separation of the proteins during the electrophoresis. To remove these pigments the tissue was homogenised in cold acetone at -5 to -10*degrees*C; the acetone was removed by vacuum filtration and the residue again washed with cold acetone. The dried residue was dissolved in 5 ml of 0.1 M sodium pyurophosphate buffer containing 10E-4M EDTA and 0.7% 2-mercaptoethanol.  The suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 x g and the supernatant again centrifuged at 35,000 x g for 30 min.  The supernatant was dialysed against 100 x volume of 0.01 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.7, containing 0.2% 2-mercaptoethanol for 48 to 72 hrs.  After the dialysis, the extract was again centrifuged at 35,000 x g for 30 min.<p>

	An improvement over this procedure was worked out in our laboratory by Dr. G. E. HART by modifying the procedure outlined by MORTON, 1955 (Procedure F).  This has not been tried with Arabidopsis leaves, but with other green tissues it certainly yields much better results.  The tissue was homogenised in 0.1 M sodium pyropyhosphate buffer (buffer volume in ml = weight of tissue in gm).  The homogenate was added slowly to ten volumes of acetone at -15*degrees*C with rapid stirring and held at this temperature for 15 min; the sediment then was collected by vacuum filtration.  The sediment was washed twice by resuspending in cold acetone at -15*degrees*C and then dried for an hour.  The dried material was ground to a fine powder and then suspended in 3 x volume of n-butanol at -15*degrees*C for 15 min.  The sediment was washed again with acetone and dried.  The rest of the procedure was the same as described earlier.<p>

	Protein estimations:  Protein estimations on the extracts were made by the method of LOWRY et al. (1951).<p>

	Electrophoresis:  Electrophoresis was performed using the method of disc electrophoresis as outlined by ORNSTEIN (1964) and DAVIS (1964).<p>

	Visualization.  Proteins:  Gels were stained in 1% amido black in 7% acetic acid for one hour and then destained electrophoretically.<p>

	Esterases:  Esterase activity was visualized by incubating the gels at 37*degrees*C in a mixture of:  1 ml of 1% alpha naphthyl acetate; 20 mg fast blue R. R.; 50 ml phosphate buffer pH 5.9, 0.1M<p>

	Lucine amino peptidase:  Gels wre incubated at room temperature in a mixture of 25 mg Black K salt and 20 mg L-leucyl-*beta*-naphthylamide in TRIS-maleate buffer, pH 6.<p>

	Peroxidases:  A nearly saturated solution of benzidine was prepared by dissolving 0.5 gm in 25 ml of 20% acetic acid.  After filtration, this was added to 25 ml of 3% hydrogen peroxide, just before putting the gels.  This reaction proceeds very rapidly and the gels have to be photographed immediately as the color fades on storage.<p>

	Alcohol dehydrogenase:  Gels were incubated in the following mixture:  50 ml TRIS - HC1 buffer, 0.1 M, pH 8.5; 5 ml 95% ethyl alcohol; 10 mg diphosphopyridine nucleotide; 10 mg p - nitroblue tetrazolium; 4 drops of 0.5% methylene blue<p>

	Staining is completed in 1 to 2 hours.<p>
