Allelism of two independently obtained mutations involved in "plastom"
alterations has been demonstrated by the method designed earlier
(REDEI, 1971).  Plants homozygous for factors gl1 and chm were used as
pollen donor and were crossed to females homozygous for as.  The F1
progeny which had normal cytoplasm and was heterozygous for all three
genes was crossed as a pistillate parent with mutant 405-A-2090 as a
pollen parent.  The progeny displayed 14 normal plants and 12 with
late appearing but clear chlorophyll deficient sectors indicating
allelism.  Expectation in case of allelism was 1:1.  Thus chm was
redesignated as chm 1 and to mutation 405-A-2090 the symbol chm2 was
assigned.<p>

Linkage studies confirmed the chromosomal location of chm in linkage
group 3 at approximately 37.5 map units from gene gl.<p>

Light microscopic examination revealed that in plants homozygous for
these alleles some cells contained more than one type of plastids.
Electronmicroscopic studies permitted the identification of a number
of different types of plastids within single cells.  The development
of plastids was often arrested at a very early stage and transitional
types along with up to completely normal chloroplasts have been
observed in a large number of cells.  Many of these abnormal plastids
were similar to those reported by ROBBELEN (1966) yet a few types of
different structural alterations have also been found. Some
chloroplasts developed only a single but huge granum or two such
"macrograna" have been observed.  In some leaf sectors of rough
appearance another type of chloroplast morphology was frequent (Figure
1).  The cells containing these unusual plastids were generally of odd
shape rather than cubicle.  The chloroplasts in some of these cells
were all irregular in shape and some of the thylakoids displayed an
almost circular or hook-like arrangement. The stroma appeared
unusually dense, the ribosomes seemed less dissimilar in size from
those of the cytoplasm.  In these abnormal chloroplasts clear areas
were unusually frequent containing fairly articulate small fibers
visible at high magnification.  These fibers are generally regarded in
plant chloroplasts as DNA (RIS & PLAUT 1962).  In spite of these
obvious structural modifications the photosynthetic activity of these
plastids appeared excellent from the presence of the numerous large
starch granules.<p>
