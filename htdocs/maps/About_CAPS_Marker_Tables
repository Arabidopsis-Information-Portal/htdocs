CAPS markers (Cleaved Amplified Polymorphic Sequences) can be used to
unambiguously map an Arabidopsis gene to one of the 10 Arabidopsis
chromosome arms.  For a detailed examination of the procedure see:

Andrzej Konieczny and Fredrerick M. Ausubel, (1993) A procedure for
mapping Arabidopsis mutations using co-dominant ecotype-specific
PCR-based markers.  The Plant Journal 4:(2), 403-410.


New CAPS markers continue to be developed by members of the
Arabidopsis research community.  Eliana Drenkard and Fred Ausubel have
collected the current list of markers, and provided it in tabular form
for each of the five chromosomes.  Markers are given in the order of
their chromosome position.  Additional information includes the primer
sequences, restriction enzyme and number of cuts for each of the
examined ecotypes.  If you have developed CAPS markers for an
additional locus, please contact either Eliana
(eliana.drenkard@frodo.mgh.harvard.edu) or Fred
(fred.ausubel@frodo.mgh.harvard.edu) so that they may include your
information in the next update.


The tables are available in three formats.  

Files ending in .txt are plain text versions, reformated for easier
reading via gopher.

Files ending in .hqx are binhex versions of formated Microsoft Word
documents (for the Mac) which may be downloaded to your Macintosh.

Files ending in .rtf are "rich text" versions which may be downloaded
and imported into a variety of word processors.


Also included in the directory is a (Cvi_CAPS.txt) file, first posted
on the newsgroup from Maarten Koornneef`s group, showing polymorphisms
for CAPS markers in the Cvi ecotype in relation to Ler and Col.
