<h1>Using the Pathway Tools Omics Viewer</h1>

<em>Note: The Pathway Tools Omics Viewer was formerly known as the Pathway 
Tools Expression Viewer.  It has recently been extended to display many other
types of experimental data, not just gene expression data, so has been 
renamed.</em><p>

The Pathway Tools Omics Viewer uses the Metabolic Overview for an
organism to illustrate the results of high-throughput experiments in a
global metabolic pathway context.  Genes (in the case of a gene
expression experiment) and proteins (in the case of a proteomics
experiment) that are involved in metabolism are mapped to reaction
steps in the Metabolic Overview, and the range of data values levels
in a given experimental dataset is mapped to a spectrum of colors.
Reaction steps in the Metabolic Overview are colored according to the
corresponding data value.  Similarly, for metabolomics experiments,
compound nodes are colored according to the data value for the
corresponding compound.  This facility enables the user to see
instantly which pathways are active or inactive under some set of
experimental conditions.

<p>
The Omics Viewer can be used for:
<ul>
<li><b>Microarray Expression Data:</b>
Reaction lines (and protein icons, where present) are color-coded 
according to the relative or absolute expression level of the gene that codes 
for the enzyme that catalyzes that reaction step.  The Omics Viewer allows a 
scientist to interpret the results of gene-expression experiments in a pathway
context.
<li><b>Proteomics Data:</b>
Reaction lines (and protein icons, where present) are color-coded 
according to the concentration of the enzyme that
catalyzes that reaction step.  
<li><b>Metabolomics Data:</b>
Compound icons are color-coded according to the concentration of the compound.
<li><b>Reaction Flux Data:</b>
Reaction lines are color-coded according to reaction flux values.
<li><b>Other Experimental Data:</b>
Any experiment, high-throughput or otherwise, in which data values are assigned to genes,
proteins, reactions or metabolites can be viewed in a pathway context using 
the Omics Viewer.
</li>
<p>

The Omics Viewer can show absolute data values (such as the
concentration of a metabolite or protein, or the absolute expression
level of a gene), or it can be used to compare two sets of
experimental data by computing a ratio and mapping the ratios onto a
color spectrum.  
<p>

The superposition of multiple sets of experimental data on the
metabolic overview can also be animated to show, for example, how gene
expression levels of enzymes change with time over the course of an
experiment.

<h2><a name="file-format">Omics Dataset File Format</a></h2>

Experimental data is imported from a file provided by the user that is
stored on the user's computer.  Each line of the file contains data
for a single gene, protein, reaction or metabolite, and is of the form:

<pre>
&lt;name-or-ID&gt;	&lt;data-column1&gt;...&lt;data-columnN&gt;
</pre>

Columns are separated by the tab character.  Lines that
start with <code>#</code> or <code>;</code> are taken to be comment
lines and are ignored by the program.  
<p>
&lt;name-or-ID&gt; can be either a common name for an object (the
BioCyc data typically includes extensive synonym lists, and every
attempt is made to match a name to the appropriate target), or the
BioCyc internal ID for the object.  Gene IDs from sequencing projects
(such as the <em>E. coli</em> B-numbers) are generally acceptable and
unambiguous.  For protein or reaction data, EC numbers may be used.
You must specify whether the entities in the &lt;name-or-ID&gt; column
are genes, proteins, reactions, compounds, or a mixture.<p>

The numbers in the data columns can represent either absolute or
relative values.  If the data values represent absolute numbers, you
may choose to visualize either a single column of absolute data values
(select "Absolute" and one data column), or the ratio of two data
columns as relative data values (select "Relative" and two data
columns).  If the data values themselves represent relative numbers,
then you need supply only a single column number, and select
"Relative".  An entry (a row of data for a gene or other object) may
contain any number of data columns (for example, if you wish to
compile measurements from several experiments or time points into a
single file), but only those data columns specified will be visualized
at a time -- all other columns will be ignored.  <p>


<h2><a name=color>Color Scales</a></h2>

The color scale used depends on the type and, by default, the range of
the data.  Thus, a particular color may correspond to one gene expression
level for one dataset, and a different gene expression level for another
dataset, depending on the range of values or the supplied maximum
cutoff value for each dataset.  We use the
spectrum from yellow/green to red, with yellow representing the lowest
expression levels or ratios in the dataset, blue representing values
in the middle, and red representing the highest values.  Reactions for
which no data was provided are drawn in black.  The legend for mapping
colors to data values is shown in the key, which is drawn to the
right of the overview for a single experiment, or to the
left for an animation.

<p> A maximum cutoff value is chosen.  By default, this is computed
from the data.  Alternatively, the user may supply a maximum cutoff
value to use.  Supplying the same maximum cutoff value for multiple
experiments ensures that the same color scale is used for
each one, so that the displays are directly comparable.

<p>
The minimum cutoff value is determined based on the maximum cutoff
value and the other parameters.  For absolute data values, we
use a minimum cutoff value of zero.  For relative data values
that are not logs, we use the inverse of the maximum cutoff.  For
relative data values that are logs, we use the negative of the
maximum cutoff.  The color spectrum is then mapped evenly along a log
scale between the maximum cutoff and the minimum cutoff.
<p>

In many cases, several genes or proteins, each with their own
expression level or concentration, will map to a single reaction.
This is because the reaction might be catalyzed by an enzyme complex
made up of several gene products, or the reaction might be catalyzed
by several isozymes, each with its own gene or genes.  Since a
reaction can only be colored a single color, we must choose which data
value to use.  For absolute data values, we choose the maximum.  For
relative data values, we choose the value whose log has the greatest
deviation from zero, under the assumption that the user is primarily
interested in identifying the entities whose behavior differ most
between the two datasets.  <p>

<h2><a name=returned>Omics Viewer Results</a></h2>

After you submit your dataset to the Pathway Tools, the Omics Viewer
returns several results:

<OL>
<LI> The Overview Diagram, colorized with experimental data.

<LI> The color key for the Overview.

<LI> For single experiments, some basic statistics computed from the
data file.  The program counts and lists gene/protein/metabolite names
that could not be resolved, or for which data was missing or
malformed.  Since, for example, not all genes will code for enzymes,
and therefore not all will correspond to reactions in the Metabolic
Overview, we compile separate statistics for only those that are
represented in the Overview and for the dataset as a whole.  The
statistics that we compute and tabulate are: number of values,
minimum, maximum and median values, and mean and standard deviation of
the natural logs of the values.  These statistics are not computed
when generating animations

<LI>  A histogram that shows the distribution of values in
the dataset.  This histogram is displayed directly beneath the
color key.  The data value range is divided into 50 intervals, using the same
criteria that we use for assigning colors.  The number of data values
in each interval is shown on the histogram, colored appropriately.  To
the left of the vertical axis is the histogram for the entities that are
represented in the overview.  To the
right of the axis is the histogram for all other entities in the dataset.
</OL>
<p>

<h2>Animation Controls</h2>

A time series can be displayed as an animation by
specifying multiple data column numbers.  The result will be a Dynamic
HTML page that initially plays the animation in a continuous loop,
showing how the experimental values and histogram change with each
experiment.  Four buttons control the animation.  They can be used to
stop and restart the animation, and step through the
individual time points.


<ul>
<li><img src=stop.gif height=25> Stop the animation at the current time point
<li><img src=play.gif height=25> Start playing the animation from the current
time point
<li><img src=prev.gif height=20> Go back one time point
<li><img src=next.gif height=20> Go forward one time point
</ul>
<p>
Note that older browsers that do not support Dynamic HTML will not be able 
to run the animation.
