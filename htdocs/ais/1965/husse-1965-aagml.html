In a model experiment on "micro-mutation breeding", BHATIA and van der
VEEN (1964) treated REDEI's very early type Landsberg-erecta with EMS,
and found no selection response for earlier (perhaps due to a
"physiological limit"), but did succeed in obtaining 11 fuly vigorous
and fertile selections, which flower 4-5 days later and have 6 more
rosette leaves.  After vernalization, they closely resemble the parent
type, which did not respond.<p>

To study the problem "easy versus difficult direction" in mutation
breeding, and to see in how far this relation varies with different
mutagens and different genotypes, we have started to treat the 11
selections, having selfed these for 10 generations.  These selections
clearly cannot be considered to represent a physiological limit.<p>

At the same time we will try to analyse the flowering time - leaf
number genotypes of the 11 selections, and of the second cycle
selections-to-be, a.o. by introducing gene B from Limburg-2 (cf. van
der VEEN 1965)<p>
