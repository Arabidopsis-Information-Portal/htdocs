Reports indicating that absorbed LSD may cause some chromosome
breakage in animal cells have appeared (COHEN et al., 1967; IRWIN and
EGOZCUE, 1967; and SKAKKEBAEK et al., 1968).  To test the mutagenic
capacities of this compound we treated Arabidopsis seeds with LSD in
water solutions to determine whether chlorophyll mutations would be
induced.<p>

Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana (L. HEYNH., race Landsberg, have been
used in two experiments.  The lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) was
obtained from the Connaught Laboratories, Toronto, Canada.  In the
first experiment lots of approximately 100 seeds were soaked in LSD
solution at concentration of 1, 10 and 100 micro g/ml for 24 hours at
24*degrees*C.  In the second experiment concentrations of 1, 10 and 50
micro g/ml were used for 17 hours at 26.5*degrees*C followed by
concentrations of 0.5, and 25 micro g/ml for the following 8 hours.
One ml of solution was used for 100 seeds. For comparison one batch of
seeds was treated with 1% ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) for 2 hours and
another batch was irradiated with 10 kR of X-rays (200kVp, 20mA,
0.27mm Cu filter).  After treatment all seeds were washed three times
(5 minutes) with tap water and placed on VELEMINSKYs complete agar
medium.  The seeds were then subjected to cold temperature
(4*degrees*C) for two days and subsequently transferred to the growth
chamber (25*degrees*C, 68% humidity and 8,640 lux).  At maturity seeds
from each M1 plant were collected individually.  The M1 seeds were
sown on agar medium.  All chlorophyll mutants detected in M2
populations were recorded.  In the Table the mutations have been
assigned to M1 plants that produced mutant offspring.<p>

Table: Chlorophyll mutation frequencies in plants treated with LSD,
EMS and X-rays<p>

In agreement with reports by various workers, we found high
chlorophyll mutation frequencies in EMS treated populations and
moderate mutation frequencies in populations subjected to
X-irradiation.  No mutations appeared in the progenies of the 165 M1
LSD treated plants.  As used here, LSD has not been shown to have any
mutagenic effects.  Negative results with LSD as a mutagen have also
been reported by GRACE et al. (1968) who found no evidence of either
chromosome breakage or gene mutation in treated Drosophila.<p>
