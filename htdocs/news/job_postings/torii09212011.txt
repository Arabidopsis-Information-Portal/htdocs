NEW FACULTY SEARCH: INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGISTS IN CELL BIOLOGY, PHYSIOLOGY, OR ECOLOGY

As part of a long-term hiring plan, the Department of Biology is conducting a search
for outstanding scientists in all areas of biology. To fill multiple positions in the
coming year, we encourage applications from candidates working in the broad areas of
cell biology, organismal physiology, or interdisciplinary ecology. We are particularly
interested in candidates appreciative of the breadth of research encompassed within
the Department of Biology and whose work actually or potentially integrates perspectives
from multiple disciplines. Some of many examples include:
• theoretical or empirical approaches to mapping genotypes to phenotypes

• systems or engineering approaches to cell biology

• ecological or evolutionary approaches to developmental biology, physiology, or both

• novel approaches to understanding interactions within or between organisms, or between organisms and their environment

As a Department, we are looking for individuals with a record of outstanding achievement
or strong indications of outstanding future potential, rather than specific research
topics or study organisms. Tenure-track appointments at the Assistant Professor rank
are anticipated. Priority will be given to applications received by 15 October 2011 at
http://www.biology.washington.edu/faculty/search/. Applicants must have earned a
doctorate by the date of appointment. All University of Washington faculty engage in
teaching, research, and service. UW is an affirmative action, family-friendly, equal
opportunity employer. We have a culturally diverse faculty and staff and strongly encourage
applications from women, minorities, individuals with disabilities and covered veterans
