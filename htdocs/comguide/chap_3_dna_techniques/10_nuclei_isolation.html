*  Nuclei can be isolated from 25 g of tissue in one day by one person 
with relative ease.  If necessary the protoplasts can be left overnight on 
ice without any apparent ill effects.
*  Grow plants either on soil or on sterile agar plates, or in liquid culture.

1.  SOLUTIONS
  (i) DIGESTION MEDIUM
0.5M sorbitol
10mM MES.KOH (pH5.5)
1mM CaCl2
1.6% macerozyme
1.6% cellulase

  (ii) FLOTATION BUFFER
0.44M sorbitol
60% percoll (v/v)
10mM MES.KOH (pH5.5)
1mM CaCl2

  (iii) RESUSPENSION MEDIUM
0.5M sorbitol
10mM MES.KOH (pH5.5) 
1mM CaCl2

  (iv) PERCOLL SOLUTIONS
Made by diluting Flotation Buffer with Resuspension Medium to maintain 
the same osmolarity.

  (v) NUCLEI ISOLATION BUFFER (NIB) (Based on Saxena et al. (1985).)
10mM MES.KOH (pH5.5)
0.2M sucrose
2.5mM EDTA
2.5mM DTT
0.1mM spermine
10mM NaCl
10mM KCl
0.15% Triton X-100
 *  For NIB + glycerol, make as above without Triton, but with the addition 
of 20% glycerol.

2.  PROTOPLAST PREPARATION
(Adapted fromSomerville et al. (1981) Plant Sci. Lett. 21, 89-96.)
  (i) Harvest 25 g of tissue.  Place 5 g in each of 5 petri-dishes.  Add 20 ml 
of Digestion Medium to each dish.  Chop the tissue into 1-3 mm2 pieces 
with a sharp razor blade.  Place into a vacuum chamber and pull a vacuum 
for 2 min. This allows the solution to enter the intercellular air spaces.
  (ii) Leave the dishes at r.t. for 3 h to allow digestion.  Now and then 
tease the tissue with a glass rod.
  (iii) Gently filter the solution through a 50 um mesh, and collect 
protoplasts in 25 ml Sterilin tubes.  Centrifuge at r.t. or 4oC for 5 min at 
200xg  (I use 3 on the dial of an MSE bench centrifuge).  Gently 
resuspend the protoplasts in 10 ml cold Flotation Buffer with a slow 
rocking motion.
  (iii) Overlay the suspension with Percoll solutions: 5 ml of 45%, 5 ml of 
35%, and 5 ml of 0%.
  (iv) Centrifuge at 300xg (I use 4 on the dial), and the protoplasts will float 
to the 35%:0% interface.  Remove them with a Pasteur pipette.  Wash 
by resuspending in 10 ml resuspension medium, and recentrifuging.  
You should have a yield of 6 x 106 protoplasts per g tissue at this stage. 
If liquid tissue culture material is used 20 x 106 protoplasts per g can be 
obtained by overnight digestion (pers. comm. Nigel Blackhall, Flow 
Cytometry Unit, Dept. of Botany, Nottingham University).

3.  NUCLEI ISOLATION
  (i) Put no more than 15 x 106 protoplasts per 15 ml Nuclei Isolation 
Buffer (NIB) in 25 ml Sterilin tubes.  Leave at 4oC for 7 min.  Force 4x 
through a 26ga (brown not orange) syringe needle.  This step is very 
tedious so get a friend to help!  Then pass through a 5 um mesh.  
Centrifuge 8 min at 500 rpm (I use 5 on the dial).  The nuclei are 
collected as a whitish pellet.
 *   If the pellet is greenish, there is considerable cytoplasmic 
contamination.  This can be  avoided by putting only 5-10 x 106 
protoplasts per 15 ml NIB.  Nuclei may be stained and  examined with the 
blue fluorescing dye, DAPI.  For counting use a slide that is no more 
than 
 20 um deep.

  (ii) From 25 g leaf tissue I expect 1.5 x 108 protoplasts, and 3 x 107 
nuclei (20% yield).  This should give 2-3 ug of nuclear DNA.  I advise you 
to check your own yields.

 *  As I have said, I'm sure that yields of protoplasts can be increased 3-4 
times by using liquid- grown Arabidopsis.  The yield of nuclei is 
increased 2-fold by putting 30 x 106 protoplasts into  15 ml NIB, but 
above 15 x 106 you really do get a large increase in cytoplasmic 
contamination,  especially with chloroplasts.
 *  The nuclei can be stored in aliquots in 1.5 ml Eppendorfs in NIB + 
glycerol at -80oC for   months with no apparent DNA degradation.

4.  NUCLEAR DNA ISOLATION
 *  This stage is up to you.  I suggest pooling the nuclei into about 1 ml 
NIB, rinsing by spinning  down hard in a microfuge and resuspending in 
0.4 ml TE.  Proteinase K treat the nuclei with
 0.5 mgml-1, 1% SDS at 30oC for 2h.  Phenol extract 2x, chloroform treat 
2x, EtOH precipitate,  but do not dry pellet in vacuum.  Tissue dry the 
pellet very carefully.  You should examine the  DNA on a gel to check its 
condition.
