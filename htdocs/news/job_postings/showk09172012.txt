We are searching for applicants to carry out research in two areas: 

(1) Symplastic communication. We have recently identified extragenic 
suppressor mutations for a gain-of-function allele of Callose Synthase 3 
(CalS3) locus (Vaten et al. Dev Cell 21:1144-55). We believe these 
mutations provide an interesting entry point for understanding how callose 
regulates cell-to-cell movement of developmental signals through 
plasmodesmata. 

(2) Secondary phase of vascular development during root development in 
Arabidopsis. We are investigating how cytokinin regulates cambial 
development (MŠhšnen et al. Science 311:94-98; Nieminen et al. PNAS 
105:20032-7). We have identified new components as an entry point both 
based on genetic screens and microarrays. 

Applicants should send 1) a cover letter describing previous achievements, 
future career ambitions and motivation for this position; 2) Curriculum 
vitae with a list of publications and contact information of two referees 
to email address: yrjo.helariutta-at-helsinki.fi**. 

The deadline for applications is September 30th, 2012. However, the 
position can be filled earlier if a suitable candidate is found.
