In order to clarify the developmental basis of the incompatibility
between different species within the taxon Arabidopsis 194 crosses
were analysed (BERGER, 1968).  Fertilization was observed in 15% of
these combinations, but only 3% of these cases yielded fertile seeds.
The reason for this failure was investigated.  The siliques were fixed
every second day after pollination and paraffin sections were
microscopically examined.<p>

In intraspecific crosses the zygote was divided into two cells 2 days
after pollination.  4 days later the apical part of the linear
proembryo was differentiated into a globular embryo-"Anlage".  Finally
12 days after pollination the embryo was full grown with the large
hypocotyl and the flat cotyledons side by side.  Until the sixth day
after pollination the endosperm nuclei rapidly increased in number.
Then the endosperm changed into the cellular state and was slowly
reduced until its entire disappearance at about 12 days after
pollination.<p>

In interspecific combinations the same developmental processes were
recorded, but with varying temporal delay.  In no case orphologically
abnormal embryos were found.  The normal sequence of stages seemed to
be blocked at different steps.  Unexpectedly, however, the endosperm
development was not retarded after interspecific pollinations, but
followed the regular pattern.  The maximum endosperm was observed 6
days after pollination, its breakdown at about 12 days.  This means
that the development of the endosperm and the embryo are independent
from each other.  In intraspecific combinations both are synchronized
and the embryo enlarges at the expense of the endosperm.  Hybrid
embryos, however, are not full grown before the endosperm breaks down
and their development, therefore, is blocked at about 12 days after
pollination.  In these combinations, e.g., Arabidopsis pumila x
Arabidopsis thaliana or Arabidopsis pumila x Sisymbrium altissimum, in
which the embryo reached more than 0,1 mm in length, cultures on 0,8%
agar (minerals and 2% sucrose after BOUHARMONT (1961) + 0,2% yeast
extract) were successful.<p>
