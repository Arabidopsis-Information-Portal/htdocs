A two-year postdoc position on cytosolic pH regulation is available in the Department of Botany at 
Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, USA. 
 
The long term goal of the project is to develop a quantitative understanding of the molecular 
components that contribute to cytosolic pH regulation in higher plants. Intracellular pH recordings 
will be performed on intact roots of Arabidopsis and Zea mays by measuring fluorescence from 
ratiometric pH indicators with a wide field ratio fluorescence imaging system and a confocal laser 
scanning microscope. As pH indicators fluorescein derivatives (like BCECF) and recombinantly 
expressed (in Arabidopsis) pH sensitive GFPs will be used. 
 
Candidates should have experience in fluorescence spectroscopy on living cells using a wide 
field imaging system and / or a CLSM. Documented ability to communicate effectively in English 
both in writing and spoken language is required. The position is available starting April 1, 2009.
