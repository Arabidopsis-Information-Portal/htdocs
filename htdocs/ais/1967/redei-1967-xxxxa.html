	It is often necessary to plant large numbers of seeds.  Single seed planting with forceps gives excellent results but it is extremely time-consuming.  It is easy to broadcast the seed with the aid of a spoon or a piece of cardboard paper.  The distribution is far from equal, however,  Furthermore, only dry seed can be planted this way.<p>

	Recently a new planting technique has been employed in our laboratory with very satisfactory results. Given weight of seed (1000 seeds weigh ca. 17 mg.) is suspended in 0.1% liquified, chilled agar.  The number of seed is adjusted to one seed per drop and distributed by a 10 ml pipette.  This way 10,000 seeds can be easily planted within one hour in any arangement.<p>
