Employment Position Available

ANU College of Science
Research School of Biological Sciences

Postdoctoral Fellow or Research Fellow
Fixed Term - 3 Years
Academic Level A or B

(Reference No.: RSBS3772)

A position is available immediately to study receptor-kinase mediated
signal transduction and transpiration efficiency in Arabidopsis, with an
emphasis on the ERECTA pathway (Masle et al. Nature, 2005). The successful
applicant will use molecular, biochemical and cell biological approaches
to identify the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms and to
investigate their regulation.

We recently demonstrated that the Erecta pathway plays a key role in the
control of stomatal density and leaf capacity for photosynthesis.  The
ERECTA gene family belongs to the large class of Leucine Rich Repeat
Receptor-Like-Kinases (LRR-RLK), a class of proteins better known in
animals, with key roles in cell development and differentiation. The
research will investigate the role of the ERECTA family in
epidermis-mesophyll coordination at the molecular, developmental and
functional levels.

The research is part of a team effort to unravel the genetic determinants
of transpiration efficiency in plants and to examine the potential for
genetic manipulation of plant performance under drought. It will involve
close interactions with other team members within both the laboratories of
Dr Josette Masle and Prof Graham Farquhar.

Candidates should have a strong background in protein biochemistry and
molecular biology/molecular genetics. Experience in developmental biology
would be an advantage. Experience with plant systems is not essential
