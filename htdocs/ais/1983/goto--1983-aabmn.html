INTRODUCTION<p>

In general, seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana require light for the
induction of germination. The germination sensitivity for light
changes with genotypes as well as with the time of after-ripening and
the light conditions of parent plants (McCullough and Shropshire,
1970). On the other hand, the induction of germination is promoted by
such substances as gibberellins, ethylene and KNO 3 (Spruit et al.,
980; Goto, 1982). Thus I have surveyed the germination responses of
seeds of a number of genotypes to brief exposure of red light and the
substances promoting the induction of germination.<p>

METHODS<p>

Seeds of various mutant strains of Arabidopsis thaliana were harvested
from plants grown in a greenhouse in spring 1982 and stored in a
plastic desiccator in darkness at room temperature until germination
tests were made (from January to March 1983). The seeds in lots of 500
were sown on 0.8% agar (20 ml) in petri dishes (6 cm in diameter) and
allowed to germinate for 5 days at 25*degrees*C in a moist container
in the dark. Red light (a 20 W red fluorescent lamp, max. ca. 660 nm
100 micro W/cm 2 at seed level) was irradiated for 10 minutes after 24
hrs incubation, and the germination percentages were determined after
additonal incubation in the dark at 25*degrees*C for 4 days. Ga 3 and
Ga 7 (10E-4 M), pH 6.0 with 0.05 M KOH) and KNO 3 (10E-2 M) were
included in the ager medium. Ethulene (1 ml) was introduced into a 6
liter acryl box in which the dishes with seeds were placed.<p>

RESULTS<p>

Table 1 shows the germination responses of 19 lines and mutant strains
to the factors. Red light induced germination of only several strains,
but more prolonged red irradiation caused germination in many strains
(data not presented). GA 7 promoted the germination of almost all
stains except for line Enkheim and its promoting activity was higher
than that of GA3. The effects of KNO 3 and ethylene varied with
strains and were generally lower than those of GAs. In adition, KNO 3
promoted the hypocotyl elongation of the seedlings in the dark (data
not presented). Line Landsberg responded to all the tested factors,
and germinated even in the untreated dark control althouth its extent
was low. Line Enkhiem showed no significant response to the factors
tested, and required relatively high intensity and prolonged
irradition of white light for germination. Strain g responded to KNO 3
and GA 7, but not to red light, GA 3 and ethylene. Strain Ng-5 that
was gibberellin-deficient mutant (Koornneef et al. 1977) requiring GAs
for germination responded partially to ethylene. The averages of the
strains indicated the promoting effect for germination being in order
GA 7, GA 3, KNO 3, red light, ethylene.<p>

Auxin (IAA, 2, 4-D), cytokinin (kinetin, benzyladenine) and abscisic
acid had no promoting effect for dark germination in either strain.<p>
