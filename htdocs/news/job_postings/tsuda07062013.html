<p>In the group of Kenichi Tsuda at the Department of Plant-Microbe
    Interactions in the Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research (MPIPZ)
    in Cologne, Germany, two Postdoctoral positions in Plant Biology/Molecular
    Biology will be available immediately. These positions are based on a Max
    Planck fellowship and will be initially funded for 1 year (with possible
    extension).</p>
<p>We seek a motivated candidate with a PhD in plant biology (biology) and
    extensive knowledge and skills in molecular biology. Experience with
    Arabidopsis and analysis of genome-wide transcriptional regulatory networks
    is desirable but not required. Applicants should have published research
    results in peer-reviewed high quality journals, demonstrated creativity,
    independence, high motivation, good communication skills, and the ability to
    work independently as well as with other members of our research group.</p>
<p>The candidate will work in a project aiming to: (1) Understand molecular
    mechanisms underlying the complex nature of the plant immune network using a
    variety of genetic resources and genomics approaches. (2) Understand plant
    immune network structures, properties and dynamics with evolutionary aspects
    using Arabidopsis relatives and natural pathogens.</p>

    Please send your application including (i) a cover letter summarizing your
    qualifications and your motivation to work on these projects, (ii) a CV with
    a full publication list, and (iii) names and contacts of two to three
    references. The application should be submitted electronically as one file
    to Dr. Kenichi Tsuda (<a href="mailto:tsuda@mpipz.mpg.de">tsuda@mpipz.mpg.de</a>).

        href="http://www.mpiz-koeln.mpg.de/">http://www.mpiz-koeln.mpg.de/</a>)
    is one of the world's premier sites committed to research into
    fundamental processes and training in plant biology. There are four science
    departments, three independent research groups and specialist support,
    totaling ~ 400 staff including externally funded positions.
</p>
<p>The Max Planck Society is committed to employing more handicapped
    individuals and especially encourages them to apply. The Max Planck Society
    seeks to increase the number of women in those areas where they are
    under-represented and therefore explicitly encourages women to apply.</p>
<p>Review of applications will begin immediately and continue until the
    position is filled.</p>
