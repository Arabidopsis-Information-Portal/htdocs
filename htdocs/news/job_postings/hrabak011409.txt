A graduate assistantship (MS or PhD) is available in my lab for Fall 2009 to study the 
function of protein phosphatase 2A in Arabidopsis thaliana.   You will use genetic, 
biochemical, and molecular approaches to characterize plants with mutations in PP2A 
genes. Students can apply electronically to either the Genetics or Plant Biology graduate 
programs via the Graduate School website http://gradschool.unh.edu.
