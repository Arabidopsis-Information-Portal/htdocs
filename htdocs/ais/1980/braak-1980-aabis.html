As we reported previously (Braaksma and Feenstra, 1979) all 7
independently arisen revertants of the nitrate reductase deficient
mutant B25 probably concern mutations of the same gene, designated su.
The gene su segregates independently from the rgn gene. Results from a
cross between a revertant line and a line segregating For male
sterility (ms-1, Koornneef and Van der Veen, 1978) suggested a rather
close linkage between su and ms (11% recombination). Since ms is
located on chromosome 5, in order to localize su, a line of Koornneef
was used, carrying the markers ttg (transparent testa and hairless)
and fg (later flowering), also laying on chromosome 5 (Koornneef and
Van der Veen, 1978; Koornneef, prs. comm.). From the F2 of the cross
revertant x marker line (rgn/rgn; su3/su3; fg+ttg+/fg+ttg+ x rgn+rgn+;
su+/su+; fg tg/fg tg) only plants with a B25 phenotype were
transplanted and grown to seed set. This was done by growing the F2 on
nitrate medium (see Oostindier-Braaksma and Feenstra, 1973), removing
the green plants and then adding 5 ml of a solution containing 2g/l
(NH4) 2SE4 in order to rescue the plants with poor growth on nitrate.
The genotype of the harvested F2 plants was therefore rgn/rgn; su+/.
The genotype for su and ttg could be determined from the phenotypes
occurring in the F3. There happens to be close linkage between ttg and
su, since in only 35 of the tested 251 tested F3 families one
recombination event had taken place. Therefore the distance between
ttg and su is estimated as 7.0 M.U. The majority of recombination
between ttg and su did not result in recombination between ttg and fg,
so that it can be concluded that su is located on the other side of
ttg than fg (linkage between tg and fg is about 16.3 M.U., Koornneef,
pers. comm.). All data are in accordance with the following map of
part of chromosome 5:<p>

Also the mutation of the nitrate reductase deficient mutant B73
happens to be closely linked to ttge. The F1 of B73 and the marker
line fg/fg; ttg/ttg was crossed with wild type. The resulting
generation was selfed and progenies were tested for occurring
phenotypes, in order to recognize recombinants. Among 163 progenies
tested, 10 showed recombination. The estimated distance between the
mutation of B73 and ttg is therefore 6.1 M.U., Preliminary data about
flowering time suggest that in this case the majority of recombination
between tg and the mutation of B73 resulted also in recombination
between ttg and fg. We, therefore, tentatively conclude that this
mutation is located between ttg and fg, very close to ms. More
detailed data will reveal whether this conclusion is correct.<p>
