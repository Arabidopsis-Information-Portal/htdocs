Our studies on the variability of cell temperature resistance in
populations reported earlier in this issue led us to investigate
different ecological races and to study the genetics of this type of
resistance.  For this purpose ecological races from the collection of
Professor LANGRIDGE and Professor ROBBELEN were used, the seeds of
which were provided kindly by the two authors.  ALEXANDROV's critria
of a stop of the protoplasmic streaming in the cell (1964) was taken
as a sign of thermal damage. By using this method we determined
the temperatures that stop the protoplasmic streaming by their action
over different durations. The results are presented in the Figure.<p>

thaliana.  Plants grown in soil culture at room temperature with 3000
lux light intensity.  1) Estland, 2) Enkheim, 3) Kopenhagen, 4) Blans,
5) A-8, 6) Kazbek<p>

It can clearly be seen that different races form a continuous series.
However, at the relatively high teperatures of short duration, like 2,
5 or 5 minutes, the different races show different points of break in
the temperature curve, i.e., 10 minutes and 20 minutes for races A-8
and Estland.<p>

ALEXANDROV (1964, 1965, 1967, 1969) who further developed NOSONOV and
ALEXANDROV's protein theory of cell excitation and damage (1940)
showed that the two parts of the temperature curve before and after
the breaking point correspond to two types of cell temperature
resistance.  In the first part of high temperatures and short duration
the straight line correlation indicates that the cause of the
temperature damage is thermal denaturation of protoplasmic proteins
leading to a stop of the protoplasmic streaming.  In the second part
of relatively milder temperatures of a longer duration, which gives an
almost vertical line, the observed damage is a resultant of two
opposite forces: the damaging action of the temperature and the active
resistance offered by the cell through repair of the damage already
going on during the temperature treatment.  The grapy suggests that
different races can show differences in both the active (second) and
the passive (first) mode of temperature reaction.<p>

LANGRIDGE (1959) showed that ecological races in Arabidopsis thaliana
differ in their response to temperature treatment when grown under the
same conditions throughout the experimental period; he argued that in
some cases this difference can be attributed to single biochemical
components, the synthesis of which is blocked in the susceptible race.
Our work tries to trace this resistance problem back to the cellular
level.  Since the straight line before the break in the temperature
curve is expected to characterise the protein denaturation, it is
quite possible that the differences in this region may ultimately be
traced to some cell protein components.<p>

The available literature (ALEXANDROV, 1964, 1969; USHAKOV, 1964, 1967)
shows that the cell temperature resistance is a character which is
species specific.  It may be changed by mutation or selection, but
remains unchanged while the organism (except lower plants and animals
who show a "tuning up" of their cell resistance according to the
temperature of the surroundings) is grown under different temperature
conditions.  It can be changed, however, by pretreatment with
temperatures which harden the cell (ALEXANDROV, 1964, 1967)<p>

Thus, while confirming the general observations so far reported in the
cytophysiological literature, our work shows that this criteria can be
fruitfully employed for a characterization of temperature resistance
within races of a species.<p>
