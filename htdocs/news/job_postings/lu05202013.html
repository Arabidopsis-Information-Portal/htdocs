A postdoctoral position in photosynthesis and amino acid metabolism
<p>
Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, MI, USA
</p>
<p>
A postdoctoral position is available in Dr. Yan Lu's lab at Western Michigan
University (WMU) to study the connections between photosynthesis and amino acid
metabolism.
</p>
<p>
Carbon metabolism and production of amino acids in plants are important for
plant fitness and food, fiber and fuel for humans and animals. The overall goal
of the project is to understand the interactions between photosynthesis and
amino acid metabolism. This project will computationally integrate
photosynthetic parameters, amino acid profiles, and carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of
Arabidopsis mutants to identify novel genes in these biological processes. Click

This postdoc will conduct focused studies on specific genes/proteins/mutants
identified from the phenotypic correlation analysis. The candidate will work in
the Lu laboratory at WMU as part of a collaborative research team at WMU (Dr.
Lu's group) and Michigan State University (Rob Last's group). WMU is a public
research institution with ~20,000 undergraduates and ~5,000 graduates.
Applicants must have a Ph.D. in biology-related fields at the time of
employment. Experience in photosynthesis, plant metabolism, and molecular
biology is highly desirable. Funding is available for three years. Salary is
commensurate with experience and qualifications.
