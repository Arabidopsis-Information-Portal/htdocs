Vol 01:<h2>REDEI, G. P.</h2><h2>A pollen abortion factor</h2>

A genetic factor (P) is responsible for the appearance of nearly 30
percentage shrunken pollen in a mutant line when heterozygous.
Homozygotes for this factor are not distinguishable from the normal
individuals and under good culture conditions shed pollution which
stains well in over 99 percent.  Heterozygotes segregate according to
the ideal expected haploid ratios e.g., P+: P=504:505.  This indicates
that factor P does not have any deleterious effect on the chromosome
which carries it and does not alter marker frequencies in F2.  These
facts give some clues why the phenotypic ratio of the pollen itself
fails to comply with 1: 1 expectation.  P effect can not be due to
gene mutation or deficiency.  Linkage to fourth chromosome markers
indicates that crossing-over in an inverted segment can not account
either for the 30 percentage pollen lethality.  P factor has a
suppressing effect on crossing-over in linkage group four.  It appears
to be a chromosomal interchange and it is under further genetic and
cytological studies.  P seems to be a useful tool in various genetic
techniques.<p>
