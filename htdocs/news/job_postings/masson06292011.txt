A postdoctoral position is open in the Masson laboratory, department of
Genetics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, starting August 15, 2011, to
investigate the molecular mechanisms that govern gravity signal transduction
in Arabidopsis roots. The selected individual will use systems-biology
approaches to compare the global molecular responses to gravity- and
mechano-stimulation between wild type and mutant roots. Candidates should
have a Ph.D. and a strong record of publication in peer-reviewed journals.
Demonstrated experience in molecular genetics is required, and preference
will be given to individuals with experience in the analysis of
next-generation sequencing and/or proteomics datasets. Candidates should
also have good communication skills and be willing to collaborate with other
researchers working on this project. Applications should be sent as single
pdf files to phmasson@wisc.edu. They should include a short statement of
research interest, a vitae, and names and contact information for three
professional references. Application review will begin immediately and
continue until the position is filled.
