INTRODUCTION<p>

The formation of a uniform swelling or collar of cortical tissue in
the root-shoot transition zone is a distinct phenomenon in several
species. A special cases of the collar is found in the Cucurbitaceae,
where a heel or peg is formed during germination on the lower side of
the seedling axis and holds down the lower half of the seed coat, thus
helping to free the cotyledons from the seed coat. Charles Darwin
(1880) was fascinated by the peg formation and wrote "Few cases can be
advanced of a stucture better adapted for a special purpose than the
present one."<p>

Wild type (WT) seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana typically retain the
seed coat at the root-hypocotyl transition zone but it is not retained
in mutants aux-1 and Dwf. This has prompted us to study the
germination and development patterns of the WT and mutants with a view
to understanding the retention of the seed coat at the root-hypocotyl
transition zone.<p>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<p>

Mutants aux-1 and Dwf were induced and isolated in Arabidopsis
thaliana L. ecotpe Landsberg, erecta mutant, on the basis of their
resistance to the auxin herbicide, 2,4-D (Maher and Martindale, 1980;
Mirza and Maher, 1980). Mutant aux-1 is characterized by 14-fold
increased resistance to 2, 4-D and agravitropic roots (Maher and
Martindale, 1980; Mirza et al., 1984, whereas mutant Dwf is
characterized by a dwarf phenotype, 2000-fold increased resistance to
2, 4-D, single unbranched and agravitropic roots with marked decrease
in the number of root hairs, and extremely short shoots which are
agravitropic at the early seedling stage. The Dwf allele is dominant
and apparently lethal after the seedling stage when homozygous but
heterozygotes survive and develop into Dwf plants (Mirza, 1983; Mirza
and Maher, 1985).<p>

Seeds were sown randomly oriented on the surface of 1% (w/v) agar in 9
cm polystyrene petridishes using a blunt needle mounted on a syringe.
The dishes were stored at 4*degrees*C for 2 days before incubation in
the vertical position at 25 +/- 1*degree*C either in darkness or light
(from white fluorescent tubes with photon flux density of 160 micro E
mE-2sE-1 at the level of dishes). In the case of dark incubation,
light was provided for the first 4 h to induce germination. The
development stages of the seedlings were recorded by directly exposing
the dish onto a photographic paper and/or by making sketches of
seedling configurations while observing under the microscope.<p>

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<p>

WT seedlings generally retain the seed coat at the root-hypocotyl
junction but it is not retained in aux-1 and Dwf (Figure 1). Seed coat
retention at the root-hypocotyl junction is apparently due to an
attachment of the root-hairs to the seed coat. The F 1 seedlings from
the cross of aux-1 female and WT male, retained the seed coat at the
root-hypocotyl junction. As the genotype of the seed coat is
determined by the genotype of the female parent, this suggests that
the different root-hair behaviour (and not seed coat structure) is
causing the absence of seed coat retention in aux-1 seedlings. Similar
conclusion can be drawn from the progeny of a Dwf plant which
segregates into Dwf and WT phenotypes.<p>

progeny segregates into Dwf and WT phenotypes in a 3 : 1 ratio<p>

The germination and growth of WT, aux-1, and Dwf in relation to the
angle of seeds is illustrated in Figure 2a-c. The development of the
seed coat retention in WT was obviously related to the degree of
gravitropic curvature of radicles. If the long axis of the WT seed was
at an angle to gravity vector, the radicle developed a corresponding
gravitropic curvature soon after emergence. Depending on the degree of
curvature, an attachment was developed between the root hair and the
lower side of the seed coat so that the seed coat was always held at
the lower, concave side of the root curvature. Orientation of the
cotyledonary side of the seed with respect to the curving root also
affected the development of the seed coat retention in WT. If the
cotyledonary side of the seed was lower, the root had to cure round it
and thus there was greater chance of developing a seed coat
attachment; on the other hand, if it was uppermost there was less
chance of root hairs coming into contact with the lower side of the
seed coat and developing an attachment. If the long axis of the WT
seed was vertical and the radical emerged without any gravitropic
curvature, the attachment of the root hairs to the seed coat was not
developed and the seed coat was carried above by the elongating
hypocotyl.<p>

In aux-1 and Dwf, the radicle grew straight in the direction of
emergence regardless of gravity. As there was no gravitropic curvature
of roots, seed coat was not retained at the root-hypocotyl junction.
In aux-1 seedlings, radicles appeared to have normal root hair
although longer region behind the root tip lacked hair in aux-1 than
in WT during later stages of growth. In Dwf seedlings, however,
radicles lacked hairs initially and it appeared that even if Dwf roots
had been normally gravitropic, they could not have developed seed coat
attachment because of the absence of root hairs.<p>

Thus, it can be concluded from the present results that a positive
gravitropic response of roots is essential for the retention of the
seed coat at the root hypocotyl junction. This suggests the
involvement of gravity and agrees with Darwin (1880) and Witztum and
Gersani (1975) who showed that peg formation in Cucurbitaceae was
induced by gravity. The peg in Cucurbitaceae is formed by the radial
enlargement of cortical cells and has been suggested to be due to the
accumulation of IAA at the root-hypocotyl junction (Witztum and
Gersani, 1975) whereas the seed coat attachment in Arabidopsis
thaliana is apparently due to an interaction between root hairs and
the seed coat. As the mutants used in this study are affected in their
auxin physiology it suggests that auxin physiology of a plant may
determine the normal gravitropic response of roots and hence the
retention of the seed coat at the root-hypocotyl junction.<p>

SUMMARY<p>

Wild type seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana typically retain the seed
coat at the root-hypocotyl junction whereas mutant aux-1 and Dwf
seedlings do not retain the seed coat at the root-hypocotyl junction
and carry it above by the elongating hypocotyls. The seed coat
retention was due to an interaction between root hairs and the seed
coat. The results show that a normal positively gravitropic response
of roots is essential for the retention of the seed coat at the root
hypocotyl junction.<p>
