An effort was made to induce mutations in Arabidopsis thaliana with a
DNA base analog by growing plants in a medium (mineral nutrients +
dextrose + agar) into which 5-bromodeoxy-cytidine was incorporated.
Wild type seeds were sterilized with calcium hypochlorite, sown singly
on the agar medium in a test tube, and the plants (M1-generation) were
grown under well-controlled conditions in a growth chamber.  Mature
seeds were harvested from each plant, whose progeny (M2-generation)
was then tested with about 50 seeds sown on soil in a pot kept in the
greenhouse.  For progeny tests of the next succeeding (M3) generation,
seeds harvested from plants grown in the pots were used.<p>

Progeny tests have now been completed for about 1000 plants of the
M1-generation.  Among these M2-families, two segregated for albino
lethal mutants and one for yellow-green leaf color mutants.  The
segregation ratios of wild type: mutant in each of these M2 families
were much greater than 3:1, thus indicating that the M1-plants were
chimeral and only a part contained the mutation. The progeny tests in
the M3 generation showed that each of these mutants is controlled by a
single mendelian recessive gene.  More plant progenies are being
tested and several additional families have recently been found which
segregate for other mutants in the M2-generation.  M3-progeny tests
have not yet been completed for these families.  As controls about
1000 plants were grown in test tubes containing the agar medium
without base analog added. These were progeny tested and no mutants
were found.<p>

Some slow-growing ("laggard") plants were obsrved to occur in both the
M2-generation and corresponding control families, though their
frequency was much higher in the former.  Preliminary progeny tests
indicate that the laggards were at least not due to single mutations.
It seems likely that they developed from abnormal seeds which had been
physiologically affected by the base analog or particular
environmental condition under which the parental plant had been grown.<p>
