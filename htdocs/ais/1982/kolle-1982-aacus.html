INTRODUCTION<p>

The experiments are carried out in the scope of the Biostack-projects
(Bocker, 1974, 1976, 1978; Kranz, 1978, 1979) for the announced
missions of spacelab. In this connection the biological effects of
individual HZE particles on isolated cells and tissues shall be
examined. Certain parts of the radiation in space can be simulated in
earth-based experiments with help of powerful accelerators. Thus,
basic proofs were made at the Bevelac (Berkeley, Calif.) in summer '81
and since July '82 at the Unilac (GSI, Darmstadt).<p>

Radiation effects of some HZE particles (Cs gamma-ray 28 and 47 krad;
He and C 1 to 5 krad; Ar 3 and 5 krad) and their mutagenic efficiency
were already observed by Fujii et al. (1965); however, mutation rate
was based on total dose and not on microdosimetric evaluation of
single HZE particles. Irradiation of seeds with several accelerated
heavy ions (C 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 krad) and X-rays (40, 60, 80, 100, 120
krad) also calculated on total dose base induced tumors in Arabidopsis
seedlings (Hirono et al., 1968).<p>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<p>

Dry seeds of A. thaliana (En-2 wild type, ch+/ch+) and chlorophyll
deficient mutant ch 2/ ch 2 are fixed by Luviskol (Scheidemann, 1977)
on AgCl- and CN-detectors (Schopper and Schott, 1977), for determining
the track of individual heavy ions and for identifying hits in the
plant subjects.<p>

Seeds are irradiated with heavy ions as follows: protons (20 MeV; 1,
20, 400, 800 krad), uranium (15 MeV/u; 5.5 x 10 5, 10 6, 5 x 10 6, 10
7 p/cm 2), xenon (11 MeV/u; 4.6 x 10 4 p/cm 2, iron (602 MeV/u; 4 x 10
3 p/cm 2), iron (602 MeV/u; 4 x 10 3 p/cm 2), argon (728 MeV/u; 2 x 10
4 p/cm 2; 18 MeV/u; 10 6, 10 7, 5 x 10 7, 10 8, 3 x 10 8 p/cm 2).<p>

The distances of the argon tracks of high energy from the apical and
root meristem are measured under an improved microscope
(Leitz-Orthoplan) with micropositioning and afterwards calculated by
use of Sharp PC 1211 microcomputer (Koller-Lampert, 1982). After
irradition and dosimetric evaluation the seeds are immediately sown in
standard soil or nutrient agar (0.8%; Redei, 1965) plus 10E-6M IES.
For the synthetic medium, the seeds are previously surface-sterilized
in calciumhypochlorite solution (5%). In the stage of rosette, all
plants are transferred to standard soil. Germination, growth and
development of the seedlings are carefully recorded. In some M 2- and
M 3- families of striking sublethality and pollen sterility,
PMC-meiosis is examined by use of Klasterska's method (Klasterska et
al., 1980).<p>

RESULTS AND CONCLUSION<p>

With the exact knowledge of the anatomy of seed, the volumes of root
and apical meristem can be localized and classed with tracks. Hereby a
correlation between the frequency of hit seeds and the damage in
developing seeds can be found.<p>

Figure 1 shows, that compared to the control hit seeds are
significantly damaged. With the number of hits per seed the damage of
the apical meristem grows in a linear fashion, and in the root
meristem this increase seems to be an exponential one.<p>

The results of the other HZE particles, so far calculated for total
dose, show that the physical parameters (MeV/u, rsp. particles per cm
2) are important factors of the biological effects observed in the
Arabidopsis seedlings.<p>

It is striking that all treatments with heavy ions result in
significant lethality (ts-test, P &lt;/= 0.05 to 0.01).<p>

Figure 1: Correlation of lthe percentage of defected seedlings and
hits per seed for root system ( y= 30.8 e 1.2x, R = 0.835) and apical
meristem (y = 2.62x + 40.08, R = 0.704.<p>

Morphological and physiological criteria (number of leaves, days until
flowering, height) are compared to control in ts-test (Sokal and
Rohlfs, 1969) for highly energetic argon-xenon- and uranium-irradiated
seeds. A part of these subjects form significantly more leaves than
control, i.e. developing seedlings are multicaulus. Further
development is delayed in relation to control and often the M 1-plants
don't reach normal height. Further details of the investigation will
be reported elsewhere (Koller-Lampert, 1982).<p>

In Figure 2 the survival curves of argon-irradiated seeds of ch +/ch +
and ch 2/ch 2 are shown. The seeds are irradiated by different
particle fluxes.<p>

Bar 10 micro m.<p>

a) four bivalents and one trivalent<p>

b) two micronuclei<p>

c) three chromosome bridges in metaphase<p>

The survival data show a plateau phase with no effect in relation to
the control seeds, following a breakdown probably caused by a
threshold dose. Survival can be related to the ability for
reproduction and repair.<p>

During the current investigation of meiosis, one trisomic plant of
M3-line (no23) is identified, which shows a trivalent in MI, and a
second one having chromosome bridges and micronuclei in PMC-dyades.
Pollensterility of the parent line (M 2) was 46.3 percent.<p>

Numerous radiation genetic experiments with Arabidopsis seeds (Ivanov,
1974; Redei, 1975; Kranz, 1982) have shown that the frequency of
induced mutations depends on the dose rates as well as on the number
of genetic effective cells in the multicellular meristem of the shoot
apex, but present knowledge about the radiogenetic conditions in the
radicle is incomplete. Our investigations show that the radicle
meristem is a more susceptible target to heavy ions. Nuclear track
detectors of high resolution, like AgCl, are indespensible tools for
precise microdosimetric evaluations and thus an improved investigation
of biolgoical defects induced by HZE particles.<p>

Presently, however, there are a lot of open questions as to the
ionizing interactions and their capabilities for inducing biological
damages, e.g., what are the roles of the core of the primary ion
and/or the diffusing secondary ionizing particles during the induction
process of mutation and aberration?<p>

SUMMARY<p>

The results of current investigations clearly show that germination
and survival rates of HZE-irradiated seeds is defective compared to
control. Frequency of particle hits in root or apical meristem are
positvely correlated with biological damage of M 1-seedlings.
Sensitivity of the meristems against HZE particles is probably
different.<p>

The survival curves indicate a threshold response. They show a long
shoulder and a sudden decrease between 10 7 -10 8p/cm 2. By exceeding
this value a drastic damage is given.<p>

Meiotic disturbancies of PMCs of two M3-plants of sublethal and pollen
sterile M2-parent lines are identified after irradiation with iron
particles of high energy.<p>
