	It has been found that the dormant seed (about 5 months old) can germinate at normal conditions (25*degrees*C, continuous light, 1250 lux) when their testa is pricked with a fine needle by means of a single prick.<p>

	In an experiment, seeds of 30 A1 lines from 5 local populations after 7 days gave only 11,9 percent germination.  At the same time, the remaining seeds were divided into halves and one part has been pricked. After further 7 days, 6.9 and 46.7 percent of the seeds germinated in the control and the pricked part respectively.<p>

	In another experiment the effect of pricking was studied in seeds of local populations HV-3 and Vra with different percent of germination.  One lot of seeds was pricked 2 hours after placing for germination, another 2 days later.  There were 3 x 20 seeds in a variant.<p>

	The operation used increased the germination in a poorly germinating population and perfected it in a good germinating one.  Since no visible differences in the imbibition of control seeds of these two populations were observed it is possible that the deciding cause of non-germination at least for the most part was the impermeability of the tests for gases<p>
