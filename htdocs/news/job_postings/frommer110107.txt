The Joint BioEnergy Institute (JBEI), led by Lawrence Berkeley National 
Laboratory in a partnership with these scientific institutions:
Sandia National Laboratories, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, University 
of California-Davis, University of California-Berkeley, and the Carnegie 
Institution for Science
is a new multi-organizational institute of world-class facilities and expertise 
located in one facility at Emeryville, California.

The goal of JBEI is to use rapidly advancing scientific techniques, such as 
systems and synthetic biology, to accelerate development of the nation's 
biofuels industry.

JBEI’s goals focus on breaking the barriers to efficient conversion of 
lignocellulosic material into biofuels. The team is establishing a highly 
integrated research center
aimed at engineering plants for better processing, efficient protocols for 
pretreatment and optimized microorganisms for increased biofuels production.

We are currently looking for a start-up team of bioinformaticians, postdoctoral 
researchers, and technicians in the areas of
plant biology, enzymology, biochemical and chemical engineering, functional 
genomics, applied microbiology, fermentation, molecular biology,
genetics, and bioinformatics that will expand to approximately 150 staff by the 
end of summer 2008.



Current Job Postings

JBEI (through LBNL) is currently looking for scientists and technicians 
interested in working on the various aspects of biofuels research, especially in 
plant cell wall synthesis, deconstruction and microbial engineering. Highly 
motivated individuals with expertise in molecular biology, metabolic 
engineering, bioinformatics and ‘omics’ are encouraged to submit a resume/CV and 
letter of interest to resumes@jbei.org
