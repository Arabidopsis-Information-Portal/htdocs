*  Several people have reported problems maintaining the C58 strain 
used for transformations.  The following medium is the one used 
successfully in our lab.

1.  M-9 SALTS x10 (l-1)
60 g Na2HPO4
30 g KH2PO4
 5 g NaCl
10 g NH4Cl

2.  M-9 MEDIUM   (l-1)
x10 M-9 salts 100 ml
1 M MgSO4 7H2O 1 ml
0.01 M CaCl2 2H2O 10 ml
40% sucrose 10 ml
1% thiamine 1 ml

3.  PROCEDURE
  (i) Dissolve 15 g of agar in 880 ml double-distilled water, stir and 
autoclave.
  (ii) Once the medium has cooled to 55oC, aseptically add the M-9 
medium. *  It is essential to add the medium after autoclaving and partial 
cooling.

 *  To maintain strains of Agrobacterium that contain introduced plasmids, 
also add the  appropriate antibiotic:
  (iii) either, 0.1 ml l-1 of 10 mgml-1 tetracycline
or, 1 ml l-1 of 25 mgml-1 kanamycin
 *  Concentrations of tetracycline higher than 1 mgl-1 will cause the 
Agrobacterium to grow very slowly.
