The mutant, aux-1, has ageotropic roots which are less sensitive to
exogenous auxin than wild type (Maher and Martindale, 1980). The
mutation, which is located on chromosome 2, does not simply act by
exclusion or reduced uptake of auxin (Martindale and Maher, 1980).
Other mutations also reduce auxin sensitivity (Mirza and Maher, 1980).
One of these appears to be allelic to aux-1, but does not affect the
geotropic response.<p>

Ageotropic mutants have obvoius uses in the analysis of the perception
and transmission of the gravity stimulus, but they also allow the
responses of organs to other stimuli, especially light, to be studied
without the confounding effects of geotropism. Here we give a brief
account of experiments to compare the effects of gravity and light on
roots of wild type and aux-1. A fuller account will appear elsewhere.
Progress in the isolation of more ageotropic mutants is also
described.<p>

1. THE EFFECTS OF LIGHT AND GRAVITY ON THE DIRECTION OF ROOT GROWTH OF
ARABIDOPSIS.<p>

The effects of light on the direction of root growth of Arabidopsis
have mainly been studied on aux-1 which is ageotropic but still
responds to light, and the effects of gravity on the direction of root
growth have been studied on wild type which responds to both light and
gravity.<p>

Light and the clockwise curvature of aux-1 roots<p>

Although aux-1 roots lacks a positive geotropic response they do show
a distinct clockwise curvature on agar surfaces under white
fluorescent lights (for illustration see Maher, 1977 and Maher and
Martindale, 1980).<p>

These observations were made on seedlings growing on agar in petri
dishes held at an angle of 60*degrees* to the horizontal with light
from above. This behaviour of mutant roots was further studied by
growing them on vertical and horizontal agar dishes. With light from
above, on vertical agar surfaces (Figure 1a) mutant roots were mostly
straight and growing away from the light, but on horizontal surfaces
(Figure 1b) they showed a clockwise curvature. When mutant seedlings
were grown in the dark (after initial 4 hours light to ensure
germination) their roots were always straignt and randomly oriented
whatever the position of the petri dish (Figure 1c). Note that the
etiolated hypocotyls maintained the normal negative response to
gravity.<p>

Thus light appears to induce the curvature of mutant roots on
horizontal agar dishes. The curvature was clockwise when illuminated
and viewed from above the dishes. However, when the dishes were
illuminated from below (Figure 1d), aux-1 roots grew in an
anticlockwise direction as viewed from above. Similar behaviour of
mutant roots was observed on agar plates held at an angle of 60
*degrees* to the horizontal.<p>

When aux-1 seeds are carefully sown on the surface of 1% in the petri
dish, the roots produced do not penetrate the agar but remain on the
surface, so that the plane of root growth is confined to the surface
of the agar. If incident light is parallel to this plane of root
growth, mutant roots grow straight away from the light showing
negative phototropism, but if incident light is perpendicular to the
plane of root growth, the mutant roots develop a curvature which is
clockwise when viewed from the direction of incident light. In other
words, when light falls onto the roots at an angle and the roots are
unable to escape from that angle because they are confined to the
surface of the agar, they develop a clockwise curvature in relation to
the direction of incident light. The extent of that curvature appears
to depend on the intensity and angle of incident light. On this basis
it might be expected that mutant roots would grow straight on
horizontal dishes if equally illuminated from above and below. This
has been supported by experiments in which mutant roots have been
sandwiched between two layers of agar. When placed between two light
sources the roots grew straight, but showed the expected clockwise
curvature when only illuminated from one side.<p>

Light and gravity in relation to the spiral growth of wild type roots.<p>

We have shown previously that wild type roots, while responding
positively to gravity in 60*degree* dishes under lights, tend to
oscillate around the long axis of growth (Maher, 1977, Maher and
Martindale, 1980). Here, we examine the behaviour of wild type roots
in relation to light and gravity in more detail.<p>

Wild type roots are negatively phototropic and positively geotropic.
On vertical agar surfaces in the dark, wild type roots grew straight
and parallel to the g-vector (Figure 2a), but on horizontal agar
surfaces, also in the dark, they often showed clockwise curvature with
a tendency to spiral growth (Figure 2b). In both cases, of course, the
hypocotyls were etiolated. On vertical agar with light from above,
wild type roots grew straight down (Figure 2c) but on horizontal
surfaces which were also illuminated from above the roots grew in an
extremely contorted spiral manner (Figure 2d).<p>

Thus, wild type roots, when subjected to a constant gravitational
stimulus in the dark show a tendency to spiral growth which can be
enhanced by light from above. The amplitude of the spiral appears to
be related to the extent of the gravitational stimulus and to the
direction and intensity of light. The relationship between the
g-vector and spiral growth has been shown in an experiment where agar
dishes, illuminated from above, were held at various angles between
and including vertical and horizontal. From growing straight on
vertical surfaces, wild type roots became increasingly spiralled as
the angle with the horizontal was progressively reduced until the
maximum amplitude of the spiral was obtained on horizontal agar. The
g-vector and illumination produce a cumulative effect when acting in
the same direction, but are antagonistic when applied in opposite
directions. Thus wild type roots are straighter on horizontal agar
when illuminated from below.<p>

2. THE EFFECTS OF LIGHT AND GRAVITY ON THE RATE OF ROOT GROWTH OF
ARABIDOPSIS.<p>

Light and gravity not only influence the direction of root growth of
Arabidopsis seedlings, they can also affect the rate. In the following
experiments seed samples were standardised by sieving wild type and
aux-1 seed and only using the sample which passed a 280 micro m mesh
but was retained by a 250 micro m mesh. (See accompanying paper,
Martindale and Maher, 1981). Seed samples of the two genotypes were
taken from plants grown under identical conditions and harvested at
the same time.<p>

Inhibition of root growth by gravity<p>

If the geotropic response of the wild type involves an inhibitor, the
extension growth of roots might be expected to be increasingly
inhibited by an increasing gravitational stimulus.<p>

The ageotropic mutant would be expected to show no such inhibition.<p>

In the following experiments wild type and aux-1 seedlings were grown
on the surface of agar held at the vertical (90*degrees*) and
decreasing angles to the horizontal (60*degrees*, 45*degrees*,
30*degrees*, and 0*degrees*), Thus, roots on horizontal (0*degrees*)
agar were subject to a constant 1g vector perpendicular to their plane
of growth. Tables 1 and 2 show the mean root lengths of these
seedlings after 48 and 72 hours in the 26*degree* growth cabinet, with
and without illumination.<p>

In the light, wild type roots show increasing inhibition with
increasing gravitational stimulus at both 48 and 72 hours. The effect
of very marked on horizontal (0*degrees*) agar. On the other hand,
aux-1 roots appear to be virtually unaffected by the angle of the
dishes and exhibit no consistent geo-inhibition.<p>

In previous experiments, we noted a large difference between the roots
lengths of aux-1 and wild type seedlings (Maher, 1977; Maher and
Martindale, 1980). This is related to seed size which is consistently
larger in aux-1 (Martindale and Maher, 1981) and which is correlated
with root length (Mirza and Maher, 1980). When seed of the same size
class is used for both genotypes, as in these experiments, the root
length difference is reduced. Of course, under conditions where
geo-inhibition affects the wild type (e.g.0*degree* dishes) the
difference will be magnified.<p>

In the dark, wild type root show some inhibition at 48 hours, but this
is not evident at 72 hours. Again aux-1 roots are apparently
unaffected. The geo-inhibition of wild type roots can be more clearly
seen in the growth curves of roots on the vertical and horizontal agar
in the dark (Figure 3). Wild type roots on horizontal agar are
inhibited compared to those on vertical agar at 36 hours, but the
difference virtually disappears by 48 hours. Note that this coincides
with the rapid extension of the hypocotyl in the dark from about 36
hours (Figure 4). Mutant roots do not show any such inhibition. An
intriguing difference between aux-1 and wild type in the rate of
hypocotyl extension is shown in figure 4 with the mutant hypocotyls
being significantly shorter at the end of the experiment.<p>

The growth curves of wild type and aux-1 roots on vertical and
horizontal agar in light (Figure 5) also show a persistent
geo-inhibition of wild type roots while no such effect is observed
with the mutant.<p>

Inhibition of root growth by light<p>

It has been shown above that both wild type and mutant roots respond
to light, but is light inhibitory to root growth in Arabidopsis?<p>

The growth curves of wild type and aux-1 roots on vertical agar in
light and dark (Figure 6) show that light appears to inhibit root
growth of both genotypes for about 48 hours, but after this time the
effect is reversed. This is probably because of the rapid extension of
the hypocotyl in the dark (see Figure 4) resulting in severe reduction
in the further growth of the root.<p>

On horizontal plates also (Figure 7) light appears to inhibit root
growth of both genotypes initially, but again hypocotyl extension in
the dark probably competes with root growth for seed reserves.<p>

More ageotropic mutants<p>

Previously, ageotropic mutants were isolated as byproducts when
screening for resistance to the auxin herbicide, 2, 4-D. We are now
selecting directly for ageotropic mutants and have accumulated over 40
selection for further testing. It will be particularly interesting to
see if any of these mutants have normal sensitivity to exogenous
auxin. We are also studying the ultrastructure of the putative gravity
perceiving cells, the statocytes, to see if any differences can be
detected between normal and mutant roots.<p>
