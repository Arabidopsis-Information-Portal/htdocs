	Arabidopsis thaliana, the race Li-2, is used in our studies on the radio-sensitivity of seeds in the course of germination under different environmental conditions.  Suitable techniques were required for:  1) germination and growth of very young seedlings for root length measurements, and 2) growing large numbers of plants to maturity in order to evaluate survival, fertility and the frequency of recessive lethals (MULLER, 1963) and for progeny tests.  Results of experiments on 1) are summarised below; those on 2) are reported separately (CONTANT, 1966, this issue).<p>

	The technique used by MULLER (1964) formed the basis for the present experiments.  However, MULLER's substrate, cotton-wool padding and filter paper, was replaced by agar, which for our purpose offers the following advantages:  a) easy and rapid preparation, even of large numbers of petridishes; b) constant composition, also with regard to moisture; c) homogenous density and moisture distribution within a dish, even if placed at an angle; d) very smooth surface, causing no obstacle to root tips; e) transparence, so that germination can be observed with lids closed (avoidance of infection),  whereas root length can be measured by placing the dishes on millimeter paper with clear ruling. The dishes must be incubated at an angle of 60*degrees* (MULLER, 1964) in order to obtain straight roots; even so, they are slightly curling and measurement with the dishes closed is only advisable if repeated observations are required on the same roots. For the last, or only, measurement, the dishes are opened and the roots straightened by gently pulling the plantlets by their cotyledons, still leaving them on the agar surface and measuring them with the aid of the millimeter paper on which the dish is standing; consequently the measurements are rapid.  Although infection was generally not serious, seed sterilisation will be tried. The effect of several other factors on germination and root growth was studied in a series of replicated trials.<p>

	Optimum light intensity was found to be, at 24*degrees*C, in the range of 9000-13000 lux (Philips TL33RS; selenium cell measurements inside the dishes); speed and final rate of germination, root growth, speed of unfolding of the cotyledons and ultimate cotyledon length were all very significantly lower at 36000 Lux (P = 0.01 or better), and some reduction in respect of these parameters already occurred at 18000 lux.  The addition of Philinea tubes (wolfram spiral) affected neither germination nor average root-length, but consistently and markedly reduced root-length variability.<p>

	At 13000 lux, a temperature of 28*degrees*C gave slightly better gemination speed, root growth (both significant at P = 0.05), uniformity and general appearance than 24*degrees*C, whereas 20*degrees*C was very significantly suboptimal in all respects except for final germination percentage, which was not effected.<p>

	Polycarbonate petridishes promoted germination speed in comparison with glass dishes in some experiments but not in others.  Root growth was not affected at medium light intensity but was very significantly more rapid in polycarbonate dishes at high light intensity (P = 0.0001).  These effects may of course depend on light source used.<p>

	Agar of 0.75% was preferable to either 0.5% or 1.0%.  The addition of 0.1% KN03 promoted even germination (cf. Van der VEEN, 1965) and was highly beneficial to all aspects of growth and early development.  No extra benefit was derived from a complete nutrient medium (cf. MULLER, 1964).  With the (very evenly moulded polycarbonate dishes 2 1/2-3 mm agar was optimal for the combined requirement of good transparence and even agar distribution.<p>

	Placing dishes under an angle of 60*degrees* increased root length by 12-25% at 9000 lux, in comparison with dishes placed horizontally.  This difference is much smaller than in MULLER's experiments (1964), possibly because the smooth agar surface permits better root growth than filter-paper in the horizontal position.  Using dishes at an angle much reduced the incidence of cotyledons sticking to the agar, which was occasionally serious in horizontal dishes, causing impaired vigour or even death.  Lowering atmospheric moisture by means of filter-paper with glycerine was not beneficial in this respect and reduced speed and evenness of germination.<p>

	Two rows, each containing 2 x 20 or 1 x 40 seeds, can be sown in a 9 cm polycarbonate dish, at 25 mm spacing.  No difference was found between top- and bottom row, provided the bottom row was sufficiently far (3 1/2 cm) from the bottom of the dish (condensation water).  Larger dishes would be of advantage but are not yet available.  Large glass dishes will in the meantime be tried.<p>

	In most stage sensitivity studies, pretreatments forming part of the culturing technique must be avoided. This is one reason why race Li-2 is very suitable:  although a 5-day cold hydration period improves the evenness of germination, this treatment is not obligatory; after-ripening is short and dormancy only moderate under our conditions.  Experiments are planned to reduce after-ripening by low doses of X-rays (cf. BHATIA, 1965); in radiobiological experiments, however, this is a rather undesirable procedure.  Anaerobic presoaking at room temperature before the 5-day cold period led to very rapid germination; neither the optimal period for such a treatment nor the ultimate benefit can yet be evaluated.<p>

	Root-length measurements in units smaller than 1 mm led to highly significant personal bias (P = 0.01) and should be avoided (cf. MULLER, 1964).  In analysing root length data the total or average length of all roots within a dish belonging to one treatment is generally regarded as one observation.  However, the frequency distributions for root length within a petridish, in the case of low doses or of unirradiated material, often corresponded well with a normal distribution; in such cases there seems to be no reason to avoid using the t-test for estabishing the significance of treatment-differences.<p>

	In view of the above results, the method finally adopted consists of a) 5-day cold treatment if experimental requirements permit (which is often not the case); b) Sowing in 9 cm polycarbonate petridishes on 0.75% agar + 0.1% KNO3; 2 rows at a distance of 25 mm, each containing 40 seeds; c) Incubation at 27*degrees*C (for technical reasons preferred to 28*degrees*C) at a light intensity of 12000-13000 lux of Philips TL33RS + addition of Philinea red incandescent light; dishes placed at an angle of 60*degrees*C; d) Observations on germination with lids closed; e) Root measurements with lids closed if repeated observations are required on the same plantlets, otherwise with lid removed and after straightening the roots on the agar surface by gently pulling the plantlets by their cotyledons; in both cases measuring to be done with the aid of millimeter paper on which the dishes are placed. Final recording normally takes place after 7 days.<p>
