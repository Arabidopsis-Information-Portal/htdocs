A graduate research assistantship is available to study cell wall biology of  
the C4 grass *Setaria viridis.* Interested applicants should have a keen  
interest in plant biology. The project will involve a combination of  
molecular genetics, genomics, imaging and analytic chemistry on the bench as  
well as modeling. The overarching goal is to understand basic and applied  
processes linked to the cell wall of land plants (representative  
publications: *Plant Physiology *153: 580-589.* Plant Physiology *153:  
420-426.). A positive and collaborative nature is key as is an undergraduate  
degree in biology or related science and preferably a Masters degree in a  
discipline of biological science.
