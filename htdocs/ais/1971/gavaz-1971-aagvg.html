The basic mechanism of flower induction remains obscure in spite of
the extensive efforts devoted to this problem over a long period of
time.  Numerous attempts have been made to identify the chemical basis
of flower differentiation (cf. KOLLI, 1969).  No single substance
could be identified so far with proven specificity concerning flower
induction.  Recently HODSON and HAMNER (1970) reported the extraction
of an unidentified compound capable of promoting flowering in two
short day plants, Xanthium and Lemna.<p>

Arabidopsis, a very sensitive long-day plant appears to be a useful
test organism for investigations on the mechanism of flowering because
of (1) the great facility by which it can be cultured under well
controlled conditions, (2) the homogeneity and stability of its
genetic background, and (3) the availability of several monogenic
mutants qualitatively different from the wild type in their
photoperiodic response (REDEI, 1962).<p>

The flower promoting effect of the antimetabolites, 8-azaadenine
(HIRONO and REDEI, 1966a) and halogenated deoxynucleosides (BROWN,
1962; HIRONO and REDEI, 1966b) is well demonstrated in this plant.  On
the basis of the autoradiographic studies conducted in the
laboratories of BESNARD-wibaut (1966, 1968) and BROWN (1968), BROWN
has suggested that bromodeoxyuridine promotes flower induction by
temporary incorporation of the analog into the nuclei of the flank
meristem of the vegetative apex and the transient inhibition of the
metabolism of those critical cells.  The lowered activity of the flank
meristem would induce precociously the cells of the axial region and
thereby conditions similar to those of natural flower determination
would be created.  It was hypothesized that after the activation of
the axial meristematic region the analog is removed from the DNA of
the flank meristem cells and normal flower development would proceed.
According to this hypothesis the flower promoting activity of
bromodeoxyuridine would be exerted through its incorporation into DNA.
This interpretation seems to be in agreement with the observations
made on plants to which the analog is applied only through the apex
and only for a limited duration.  It is difficult to visualize
however, how the selective uptake and elimination of the analog can
take place under the conditions of continuous supply of
bromodeoxyuridine through the roots in the aseptic test tube cultures.<p>

In order to clarify these inconsistencies we followed a different
approach for tracing the metabolic fate of 5-bromodeoxyuridine, which
was provided to the plants in agar cultures.  Our recent experiments
are in perfect agreement with previous observations that this analog
is a very potent inducer of flowering in mutant gi2.  We also cultured
plants on 3H-bromodeoxyuridine (1.25 microcurie per ml mineral sucrose
agar medium) with the appropriate controls.  From 15 to 20 days after
germination we harvested individual plants, removed the roots and
washed the leaves under running tap water for approximately ten
minutes to remove surface contamination.  In order to detect whether
the plants would have some absorbed radioactivity we dipped some
control plants (grown on "cold" nutrient solution) into isotope
containing agar medium.  After washing no traces of radioactivity were
found in the tissues of such plants. The washed plants were then
homogenized thoroughly in cold (-20*degrees*C) absolute acetone to
remove all visible leaf pigments, and the extraction was repeated. The
pellet was then transferred to pH 5 acetate buffer (0.01 M) containing
EDTA and sodium dodecyl sulfate and sometimes also bentonite.  To this
suspension we added an equal volume of water-saturated freshly
distilled phenol.  This extraction procedure was essentially similar
to that of KUO and REDEI (1971) but the repeated phenol extraction
were omitted. After centrifugation the buffer-phenol extract was
collected with a Pasteur pipette in four fractions. The top layer was
treated with double volume 95% ethanol containing NaCl and left
overnight at -20*degrees*C.  After centrifugation at -20*degrees*C,
for 1-3 hours in a swing-out Sorvall HB rotor, we obtained a small
whitish pellet and a completely clear supernatant.  The scheme of
fractionation is illustated in Figure 1.<p>

components<p>

Fraction No. 2 was taken up in a small volume of buffer, the others
were used without any further treatment for measurement of their
radioactivity. This was carried out by adding 0.2 ml of each fraction
to ten ml scintillation liquid of the following composition:<p>

Dioxane 2 1, naphthalene 240 g, PPO 16 g, dimethyl POPOP 0.8 g,
methanol 400 ml, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether 80 ml brought to a
volume of 4 1, with dioxane.<p>

This mixture was analyzed in an automatic Packard liquid scintillation
counter and the following results were obtained:<p>

<a href="/ais/images/vol08/vol08-pg18-tab1.gif">Click here for table</a><p>

The total detectable radioactivity of single plants varied between
4,000 to 6,000 cpm.<p>

It should be noted that this separation does not produce absolutely
clean fractions and only the radioactivity of fractions 1 and 3 is
significant.  Fraction 3 being the phenol-water interphase is
certainly contaminated with fraction 1, thus only fraction 1 can be
considered to contain appreciable amount of tritium.  None of the
comparable fractions obtained from the plants grown on non-labelled
medium contained any detectable radioactivity.<p>

These data indicate that the flower promoting activity of
bromodeoxyuridine does not involve incorporation of significant
amounts of the analog into macromolecules. The radioactive fraction
was further analyzed by ascending paper chromatography (Whatman No. 1
paper, n-butanol (water-saturaged) 100 part, 15 n ammonium hydroxyde 1
part) and no radioactivity was associated with bromodeoxyuridine,
bromodeoxyuridine monophosphate, or bromodeoxycyutidine.  All the
radioactivity remained at the origin.<p>

Our observations do not rule out the possibility that a small amount
of the analog was actually incorporated into DNA but the bulk of the
radioactivity was present in other molecules of the cell.  The report
of BONOTTO et al. (1968) indicates only weak incorporation of BDU into
DNA.  This observation is supported by low mutagenicity of halogenated
nucleosided in Arabidopsis (HIRONO and SMITH, 1969)<p>

It was surprising to us that no one looked for the presence of BDU in
non-macromolecular components of the cells of Arabidopsis.<p>
