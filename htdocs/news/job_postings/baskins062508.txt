University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 
Bard College at Simon's Rock, Great Barrington, MA 
 
The labs of Eric Kramer (Bard College at Simon's Rock) and Tobias Baskin (University 
of Massachusetts, Amherst) have a position for a postdoctoral fellow. Kramer and Baskin 
have a joint, NSF-sponsored grant to study transport in the arabidopsis root, with a focus 
on auxin. Highest priority will be given to candidates with demonstrated skill in plant cell 
biology and microscopy. Experience with arabidopsis is NOT required (for all you maize 
folks). Experience with or willingness to learn mathematical/computer simulation 
techniques is preferred, but not essential. The postdoc will live near Amherst, MA, with 
occasional trips to Simon's Rock. The position starts Sept 1, 2008, and screening 
applicants will begin immediately. Initial appointment is for one year, with the possibility 
of renewal for up to three more years. Persons from groups under-represented in the 
sciences are strongly encouraged to apply.
