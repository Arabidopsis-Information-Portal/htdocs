As byproduct of the isolation of biochemical mutants two independently
arisen morphological mutants were isolated which seemed suitable as
markers. The mutants are phenotypically alike and are characterized by
distorted trichomes (hairs) on leaves and stems. Trichomes are short,
bent, more or less club-shaped and less often banched than wildtype.
Both mutants proved to be monogenic and recessive.<p>

RESULTS<p>

The F1 of the two mutants showed wildtype phenotype, indicating
non-allelism of the mutations. Recombination between the markers was
determined by crossing their F1 by wildtype, selfing the resulting
generation and establishing the percentage of progenies showing only
wildtype plants, the recombination percentage being calculated as
twice this value. Of 416 progenies tested, 50 were non-segregating,
yielding a recombination of 24,0%. This recombination percentage
confirms the previous conclusion that two different genes are
involved. As gene symbols were chosen dis-1 and dis-2 (distorted
trichomes). The genes dis-1 and dis-2 are clearly linked.<p>

Further linkage relationships were sought by crossing both mutants
with various markers and analyzing F2-families. Both dis-1 and dis-2
appeared to be linked with an, which is located in linkage group 1
(Lee-Chen and Steinitz-Sears, 1970). After isolation of the double
recessive, recombination percentages were determined from testcross
data, an-dis-1 being 10.0+/- 2.2% and an - dis-2 being 31.8 +/- 3.3%.<p>

In the search for linkage relationships also crosses with marker ch 1
(Hirono and Redei, 1965) had been made. That the F2-data from these
crosses also pointed to nonindependent segregation was somewhat
surprising, since according to Lee-Chen and Steinitz-Sears (1967) an
and ch belong to different linkage groups (cf. Kranz and Scheidemann
this volume). These crosses were made after isolation of the double
recessive recombination types and the analysis of the resulting
progenies yielded the following recombination values: dis-1 - ch: 38.9
+/- 2.9% and dis-2 - ch: 16.5 +/- 2.5%.<p>

Our ch-line originated from seeds, given to us by Prof. Redei back in
1961. The cross dis-2xch was repeated, using as the ch-parent plants
that were grown from seeds kindly provided by Prof. Redei in 1975. The
latter seeds were from che ch-line, maintained in Columbia, Mo., and
used for the trisomics analysis, to be mentioned below. Analysis of
the resulting F2 yielded confirming evidence of linkage between dis-2
and ch, the numbers of +/. +/., +/. ch/ch, dis/dis +/., and dis/dis
ch/ch plants being resp. 121, 53, 47 and 1 (chi sq. (3:1) for +/ch:
1.3514, 0.10&lt;P&lt;0.25; chi sq. (3:1) for +/dis-2: 0.0541,
0.75&lt;P&lt;.90; chi sq. (indep.): 14.4645, P&lt;&lt; 0.005).  The recombination percentage calculated from these data is 15.1 +/- 6.5%.<p>

The recombination percentages can be summarized in the following
provisional chromosome map<p>

DISCUSSION<p>

Our data clearly indicate that the genes an, dis-1, dis-2 and ch
belong to one linkage group. Lee-Chen and Sears (1967), referring to a
private communication by Redei, place an in linkage group 1 and ch in
linkage group 4. That an and ch originally were placed in different
linkage groups gives no problem, since according to our data an and ch
lie sufficiently wide apart (=/- 50 m.u.) to show independent
segregation. However, according to Sears and Lee-Chen (1970) an
appears to be on the chromosome which is present in triplicate in the
fragilis trisomic, whereas ch is located on the chromosome which is
additionally present in trisomic II (Lee Chen and Steinitz-Sears,
1967). The gene an does not show a trisomic ratio in a cross with the
latter trisomic.<p>

A translocation in our material, bringing together an and ch on one
chromosome, might explain the contradicting results. In that case the
F1 of the cross an x ch should be partially sterile, when the "recent"
Columbia line is used as the ch parent. However, this F1 proved to be
normally fertile (data not given).<p>

When the chromosomes of our marker lines do not differ structurally
from those of the lines maintained at Columbia, the question arises
whether the allocation of linkage groups to chromosomes in the
trisomic analysis was completely right. Lee-Chen and Steinitz-Sears
stated in their 1967 article: "The ratios obtained show very clearly
whether a disomic (3:1) or a trisomic ratio is involved. The only
exception to this is the mutant ch, which gave somewhat variable
results in the F2 from crosses with II. However, this is most probably
the chromosome which carries ch and other genes of linkage group 4."
In their second article the authors mention, referring to their first
report, which, however, does not contain information to this point,
that trisomic II carries, besides linkage group 4, also linkage group
6. Trisomic no. II, which was isolated by Robbelen in the race
Enkheim, was equalized to trisomic C, isolated in the Columbia
material, by Sears and Lee-Chen on grounds that the latter trisomic
was shown to possess the gene vc2 of linkage group 6. No data
concerning the segregation of genes, belonging to linkage group 4 are
given for crosses involving trisomic C.<p>

When considering the evidence given above, we feel that the allocation
of linkage groups to chromosomes should be revised, and that linkage
group 4 is contiguous with linkage group 1. Supporting evidence for
this assertion is given in the following paper by Koornneef and Van
der Veen (1978).<p>
