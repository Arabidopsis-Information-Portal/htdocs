<H1>Graph display</H1>
<I>/staffan 1995-05-25</I> <P>
A proposal for a tag2 system set of models that could be used for
driving a general graph/network display.

<PRE>
?Graph ...
       Contains &lt;TagX&gt; &lt;?Class&gt; XREF Graph
                ...
                Graph ?Graph XREF Graph #GraphInfo
       ...
</PRE>

Tag2, so &lt;TagX&gt; can be anything. The objects of &lt;?Class&gt;
should either be ?Graph objects themselves <B>or</B> have the following:

<PRE>
&lt;?Class&gt; ...
         Graph ?Graph XREF &lt;TagX&gt; #GraphInfo
         ...

</PRE>

where &lt;TagX&gt; is the same tag as the one under Contains in the
?Graph model. <P>

All the complications have to be handled in ?GraphInfo. The main
one is that of the different natures of arcs and nodes. One
way of solving this would be to simply force one
representation. A related complication is that we'll want to keep
track both of the Class and the name of each object placed on the
Graph (compare this to Map, where all info is in the form of Tags and
Floats in Map_position.)

<hr>
<H2>First iteration</H2>

Force node representation. The ?GraphInfo class keeps info on which
other Nodes to direct arcs at. To make this general, wee need to make
this Tag2 also:

<PRE>
?GraphInfo Label ?Text
           ArcFrom &lt;Tag&gt; &lt;?Class&gt; // node type
                   ...
           ArcTo &lt;Tag&gt; &lt;?Class&gt; // node type
                 ...
</PRE>
It's up to the curator to add all the needed node classes. <P>

The equivalent arc representation would be:
<PRE>
?GraphInfo Label ?Text
           FromNode &lt;Tag&gt; &lt;?Class&gt; // node type
                    ...
           ToNode &lt;Tag&gt; &lt;?Class&gt; // node type
                  ...
</PRE>

Again, it's up to the curator to add all the needed node
classes to GraphInfo. <P>

Note that in the Node representation it is hard to represent
multiple-headed or -tailed arcs, while it's easy in the arc
representation, <B>but</B> only if we keep an arcID of some sort (I
think... but this may be internal to the code?)

<hr>

<H2>Second iteration</H2>

Simply bung both representations together! It's now up to the model
writer/data enterer to chose a sensible representation. In the code,
though, representation should probably be arc, since that allows
making multiple-head and -tail arcs.
<PRE>
?GraphInfo UNIQUE Node Label ?Text
                       ArcFrom &lt;Tag&gt; &lt;?Class&gt; // node type
                               ...
                       ArcTo &lt;Tag&gt; &lt;?Class&gt; // node type
                             ...
                  Arc Label ?Text
                      FromNode &lt;Tag&gt; &lt;?Class&gt; // node type
                               ...
                      ToNode &lt;Tag&gt; &lt;?Class&gt; // node type
                             ...
</PRE>

In actual usage you might want to make the Arc and Node branches
separate constructed subtypes - this would simplify the Tag naming
[see the Example].

<H2>Example</H2>

A simple metabolic pathway expressed in the 'old' notation, and in the
old models:

<PRE>
Pathway : "*Alanine biosynthesis"
Components	 "Glutamate -> Alanine"

Pathway : "Glutamate -> Alanine"
Major_Reactant	 "Glutamate"
Major_Reactant	 "Pyruvate"
Major_Product	 "Alanine"
Major_Product	 "2-Oxoglutarate"
</PRE>

Second-iteration models for this:

<PRE>
?Graph ...
       Contains Pathway ?Pathway XREF Graph
                Reaction ?Reaction XREF Graph
                Metabolite ?Metabolite XREF Graph
                Graph ?Graph XREF Graph #GraphInfo
       ...

?Reaction ...
          Pathway ?Pathway XREF Reaction
          Metabolites Reactant ?Metabolite
                      Product ?Metabolite
          Graph ?Graph XREF Reaction #GraphInfo
          ...

?Pathway ...
         Reaction ?Reaction XREF Pathway
         Graph ?Graph XREF Pathway #GraphInfo
         ...

?Metabolite ...
            Graph ?Graph XREF Metabolite #GraphInfo
            ...

?GraphInfo UNIQUE Node #NodeInfo
                  Arc #ArcInfo

?NodeInfo Label ?Text
          ArcFrom FromMetabolite ?Metabolite // node type
          ArcTo ToMetabolite ?Metabolite // node type

?ArcInfo Label ?Text
         FromNode FromMetabolite ?Metabolite // node type
         ToNode ToMetabolite ?Metabolite // node type
</PRE>

Data expressed in <B>Node style</B> in these models look like:
<PRE>
Reaction : "*Alanine biosynthesis"
Reactant "Glutamate"
Reactant "Pyruvate"
Product "Alanine"
Product "2-Oxoglutarate"

Metabolite : "Glutamate"
Graph "*Alanine biosynthesis" Node ToMetabolite "Alanine"
Graph "*Alanine biosynthesis" Node ToMetabolite "2-Oxoglutarate"

Metabolite : "Pyruvate"
Graph "*Alanine biosynthesis" Node ToMetabolite "Alanine"
Graph "*Alanine biosynthesis" Node ToMetabolite "2-Oxoglutarate"
</PRE>

Note that in this case the graph will look like:
<PRE>
         Glutamate      Pyruvate
	     |  \  	/     |
	     |	 \     /      |
	     |	  \   /       |
	     |	   \ /        |
	     |	    X	      |
	     |	   / \	      |
	     |	  /   \	      |
	     |	 /     \      |
	     v |_       _|    v
	 Alanine	  2-Oxoglutarate
</PRE>

Expressed in <B>Arc style</B>:

<PRE>
Reaction : "*Alanine biosynthesis"
Reactant "Glutamate"
Reactant "Pyruvate"
Product "Alanine"
Product "2-Oxoglutarate"
Graph "*Alanine biosynthesis" Arc FromMetabolite "Glutamate"
Graph "*Alanine biosynthesis" Arc FromMetabolite "Pyruvate"
Graph "*Alanine biosynthesis" Arc ToMetabolite "Alanine"
Graph "*Alanine biosynthesis" Arc ToMetabolite "2-Oxoglutarate"
</PRE>

I have the feeling this would require some magic stuff in the code -
namely the implicit assumption that each Arc type object only has one
arc on the graph, so that all the Graph lines with the same Graph
object in the object apply to the same Arc. <P>


<hr>

<H2>Some remarks</H2>

<I>A personal caveat</I> I have problems keeping this right in my head, so I
wouldn't be surprised if this is completely off the mark. <P>
<I>Probably obvious!</I> The code should pass through all the redirections to collect the
entire network, and check it for consistency before trying to lay it
out (does the metabolic pathway code do this?) <P>
