Funding Opportunities for Annual Meeting

The North American Arabidopsis Steering Committee (NAASC) organizes and
obtains funding for the annual International Conference on Arabidopsis
Research when it is held in North America (two out of each three years) and
raises funds to facilitate participation by U.S. and North American
researchers when the meeting is held abroad.  This year’s meeting will be in
Beijing, China from June 20th-23rd, 2007.

The NAASC would like U.S. and North American Arabidopsis researchers to be
aware of two funding opportunities:

(1) Full funding is available for up to 8 U.S. individuals who are members
of under-represented minority groups and scientists at Minority-Serving
Institutions, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and 1890
Institutions.

(2) Partial travel supplements ($1,000 each) are available for up to 20
individuals from North America (Canada, U.S., Mexico, Central America).
Eligible individuals include graduate students, postdoctoral researchers,
and junior faculty (within 2 years of initial appointment).
