Vol 01S: <h2>Mutagenicity of Some Monofunctional Alkylating Agents</h2><p>

M. JACOBS<p>

The mutagenic activity of various monofunctional alkylating agents is
now well established in several organisms. One of the most studied,
ethyl methanesulphonate (EMS), has been proved to be mutagenic in
bacteriophage (LOVELESS, 1958), bacteria (SCHWARTZ, 1963), Drosphila
(FAHMY and FAHMY, 1956), Habrobracon (LOBBECKE and VON BORSTEL, 1962),
barley (HESLOT et al., 1961), Vicia (GHATNEKAR, 1964), Arabidopsis
(ROBBELEN, 1962) and wheat (D'AMATO et al. 1962; SHAMA RAO and SEARS,
1964). Other monofunctional alkylating agents as methyl
methanesulphonate (MMS) and butyl methanesulphonate (BMS) have been
shown to be mutagenic in barley (FROSSE-GERTZEN et al., 1963).  The
present experiment has been done with Arabidopsis to test the activity
of these mutagenic agents, their biological effects and the spectra of
the induced chlorophyll mutants.<p>

Material and Methods: Seeds of the race Wilna have been soaked in
freshly prepared unbuffered aqueous solutions of EMS, MMS and BMS at a
concentration of 0.08 M for 3 h at 25*degrees*C or in the same
concentration buffered with tris-buffer (2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl) 1,3
propandiol) at pH 6.5. Since MMS is reported (MINOCHA and ARNASON,
1962) to be highly toxic to plants, short soaking periods were
preferred.  After the treatment, the seeds were washed with distilled
water three times during 5 min and then soaked for 12 h at
24*degrees*C in distilled water also. Seeds were sown in pots in the
glass house with an artificial light supplement of 5.000 lux during 16
h per day.<p>

Biological responses to the mutagenic treatments were determined by
evaluating the percentage of germination, the speed of germination,
the percentage of flowering plants 30 days after sowing and the number
of surviving plants at harvesting time. Degrees of sterility were
estimated by collecting 200 siliques and counting the mean number of
seeds per silique in each treatment series (control mean = 100). The
frequency of the different chlorophyll mutants was recorded from an
examination of the seedlings in the M2 generation.<p>

Results:<p>

M1 effects: A general survey of M1 data can be made from Table 1.  MMS
causes more physiological damage and death at similar doses than other
sulphonates (Figure 1). The breakdown after BMS treatment only appears
in the case of higher soaking durations. The protective effects of
buffer are only evident at highly toxic treatments (Figure 2).
According to FROEZE-GERTZEN (1964) in the range of temperature and
treatment duration used, no considerable hydrolysis occurs in the case
of EMS. Damaging effects on growth are highly pH dependent, probably
through inhibition of the metabolic activity. We may suppose that
hydrolysis rate of MMs may be faster than for EMS. In fact, viability
is only partially restored in tris buffered media and, under our
experimental conditions, toxicity of hydrolysis products or other
factors such as reaction rate of MMS could be increments. As shown in
Figures 3 and 4 a high level of toxicity has been reached with MMS by
using a higher molarity of the solution or by using longer soaking
times with a 2 g/1.000 ml solution.<p>

Delay of flowering is most conspicuous in MMS, whereas duration of
treatment is the predominant factor for BMS action. BMS showed a
delayed effect on plant lethality. After this treatment a lot of
plants exhibit a very poor growth and generally die before maturity.<p>

Table 2 shows that the same degrees of sterlility (about 60% are
induced by EMS and BMS. After MMS treatment the sterility was about
85%.  Moreover, at approximately the same level of survival MMS
induces a clearly higher sterility than with BMS and EMS. Probably the
property of MMS to induce sterility is largely due to various
chromosomal aberrations. MOUTSCHEN (1964) recently indicated that
among monofunctional sulphonates MMS was the most active in producing
aberrations in Vicia and Hordeum. According to MOUTSCHEN et al. (1964,
1965) chromosomal aberrations are also obtained with EMS and BMS, but
at a clearly lower level than with MMS. GHATNEKAR (1964) also pointed
out that after EMS treatment of Vicia seeds meiosis in X1 pollen
mothercells shows translocations and inversions, the sterility induced
by EMS thus might be partially traced back to chromosomal aberrations.<p>

Another fact, worthwhile mentioning, is the high level of
chemoresistance of Arabidopsis in relation to the used concentrations.
Possibly this feature might be correlated with the high
radioresistance of the same species which has been demonstrated by
SPARROW and EVANS (1961).<p>

Mutation frequencies after treatment with sulphonates: From Table 3,
it may be seen that all sulphonates induce chlorophyll deficient
mutations in Arabidopsis. In comparison to the concentration used, the
most efficient mutagen of the group is EMS, producing relatively low
rates of somatic damage and a rather low sterility.  This property
enhances its mutagenic value, more so when the mutation rate is
related to the percentage of survival (Table 3). Concerning MMS, our
data don't support the results of MINOCHA and ARNASON (1962) who
reported a mutation rate ten times higher for MMS than for EMS.  The
low percentage of survival together with the high degree of sterility
do not speak in favour of this compound, especially for application in
plant breeding.  BMS, however, is worthy of further investigation,
though the results reported here even at higher doses do not show a
similar effectiveness as that mentioned by NILAN et al.<p>

Table 3: Frequency of chlorophyll mutations after treatment with EMS,
MMS and BMS<p>

in experiments with barley (FROESE-GERTZEN et al., 1963). The effects
of buffer on mutation rate have not been observed but possibly short
soaking periods may be an important factor.<p>

In Table 4 the relative percentages of various chlorophyll types have
been presented. From this it is evident that: 1) the rate of albina is
relatively low for all compounds, b) the frequency of the viridis type
of mutation is the highest, c) MMS and BMS appear as mild mutagenic
agents, yielding only viridis mutants.<p>

Thus the distribution of the various kinds of abnormalities apparently
changes with the agents used. A X2 test shows that the relative
distribution of the different types of chlorophyll mutant indeed
depends on the kind of alkylating agents (Table 5). A similar shift in
the distribution of mutants has previously been claimed in barley
(EHRENBERG, GUSTAFSSON and LUNDQUIST, 1959) and wheat (D'AMATO et al.,
1962). These phenotype differences, of course, must not involve
specific chemical interactions of the mutagens at the molecular level.
We know that shifts of mutation spectra can be induced by such factors
as changes of physiological conditions or unequal selection during
ontongeny of plant. Nevertheless, even results of this type can be of
some interest from a practical standpoint. Screening methods of a
definite locus specificity, e.g., using biochemical instead of
chlorophyll mutants, would probably yield more conclusive results.<p>

Discussion:<p>

BONOTTO: The different mutants you obtained are lethal or viable
mutants?<p>

JACOBS: Some of them are lethal. In the viridis class most of the
seedlings are viable; albina and xantha types are lethal.<p>

MULLER: How did you define the term mutagenic efficiency?<p>

JACOBS: Relatively to the percentage of survival, using mutations per
M1 plant progeny.<p>

REDEI: What is the frequency of dominant mutations in these
treatments?<p>

JACOBS: I didn't test that frequency.<p>

REDEI: If you treat the wild type with these chemical mutagens you get
sectors. What are those sectors genetically?<p>

ROBBELEN: Well, there may be some extrachromosomal types.  These were
the only ones which I could analyse in my material. It is however, a
small fraction and the other can be everything, phenocopies, dominant
mutants, chromosomal aberrations, conversions or others.<p>

REDEI: These sectors occur in a very high frequency. Sometimes one
fifth of the material displays sectoring.<p>

ROBBELEN: Oh, in my experiments more than 50%, but even sometimes
nothing, this depends on various, up to now unknown factors.  I ran
studies about the efficiency of mutagens after different times of
presoaking. As I had to take short treatment time, I used very high
concentrations of EMS, up to 3% for 3 hs. This gave up to 50% sectored
plants under some conditions, but also only 2% in other experiments,
and I don't know what happened.<p>

MULLER: Have you determined the mutation frequency in this case?<p>

ROBBELEN: As far as I could I did it, but sterility interferes
extremely, so that these figures don't show so much.<p>

MULLER: I have found that, in general, the frequency of M1 plants with
chlorophyll deficient sectors is proportional to the frequency of
recessive lethals.<p>

REDEI: Did everybody already test these sectors. Certainly some
strands come to the shoot.<p>

JACOBS: We tried this, to test the mutation rate between plants with
and without sectors in M1 generation, and we didn't find any
difference.<p>

ROBBELEN: I did just the same and I agree with Mr. JACOBS, there was
no difference. When I was able to transmit the white seeds, the
seedlings offspring was entirely white. But I did it on soil and not
on sucrose agar, so the seedlings died. But the seeds from white
sectors from M1 plants were entirely white again.<p>

GICHNER: We have been interested in the relation of the frequency of
chlorophyll chimeras to the values of M1 sterility and to the
frequency of M2 mutants. If the frequency of chimeras is higher than
20%, all plants are entirely sterile or do not flower; when the
frequency is 10 to 20%, the sterility is nearly 100%. 4 to 10% of
chimeras correspond to about 50 to 80 sterility grade. The best
concentration for induction of mutations are those inducing 0.5 to
3.5% of chlorophyll chimeras. These relations are valid for compounds
acting probably as monofunctional alkylating agents. In case of other
mutagens, e.g., X-rays or bifunctional agents, the relations are
different.<p>
