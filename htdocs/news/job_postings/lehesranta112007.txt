TRANSCRIPTIONAL NETWORKS REGULATING PHLOEM DEVELOPMENT 
 
 
We are investigating the molecular basis of vascular development in 
Arabidopsis root using genetics and functional genomics as approaches. 
We have established the role for cytokinins in controlling vascular 
morphogenesis (Mähönen et al. Genes Dev 14: 2938; Mähönen et al. Science 
311: 94) and shown that  ALTERED PHLOEM  DEVELOPMENT (APL) locus is 
required for proper vascular tissue identity and codes for a 
transcription factor (Bonke, Thitamadee et al. Nature 426: 181). Based 
on genome wide transcriptional profiling, we have recently identified a 
set of genes the  activity of which is dependent on APL. 
 
We are looking for an enthusiastic PhD student candidate to join our 
team to characterize these new factors of phloem development in 
Arabidopsis. The position will be filled at the earliest from 1st of 
January 2008. Applications are considered from now on until a suitable 
candidate is found.
