DNA EXTRACTION FROM PLANTS OF ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA

Based on the Meyerowitz Laboratory Protocol, as used by Karen Ingle
(Department of Molecular Genetics, The Cambridge Laboratory, The 
John Innes Centre for
Plant Science Research, Colney Lane, Norwich, NR4 7UJ, England.)

1.   UREA EXTRACTION BUFFER
 200 ml-1
8.0M Urea (reagent grade) 96 g
0.35M NaCl 4 g
0.05M Tris.Cl pH 7.5 10 ml of 1M
0.02M EDTA 8 ml of 0.5M
2% N-Lauryl sarcosine 4 g
5% Phenol 10 ml

2.  EXTRACTION
  (i) Place greenhouse-grown plants to be harvested in the dark for 1 to 2 
days prior to collection, to reduce the starch content in the tissues.
  (ii) Harvest 5 g of plant tissue, removing the roots.
  (iii) Freeze immediately in liquid nitrogen and store at -80oC.
  (iv) Cool a pestle and mortar with liquid nitrogen, add the frozen plant 
material and grind to a fine powder.  Ensure that the tissue does not 
thaw at this stage, by adding more liquid nitrogen as needed.
  (v) Transfer the powder to a 50 ml polypropylene disposable centrifuge 
tube (These centrifuge tubes have a pointed base supported by a ring 
of plastic, to prevent collapse
in the centrifuge.  They can be obtained from R and L Slaughter 
(catalogue number CF370-28).) -- use this type of tube throughout) and 
add 40 ml of urea extraction buffer.
  (vi) Mix or vortex vigorously, add 1.6 ml of 20% SDS, mix well and 
incubate at 65oC for 
10 min.
  (vii) Split equally between two new tubes.
  (viii) Add 20 ml of a 1:1 mixture of phenol:chloroform, mix carefully to 
avoid shearing the DNA.
  (ix) Centrifuge at 4,000rpm for 15 min, (we use a Centaur 2 bench top 
centrifuge).  Transfer the upper phase to a new tube.
  (x) Repeat steps (viii) and (ix).
  (xi) Add 4 ml of 5M Potassium acetate (KOAc) and 16 ml of isopropanol.
  (xii) Mix gently and pellet immediately at 4,000 rpm for 15 min.  A cream 
to brown pellet of nucleic acid should be visible.
  (xiii) Dry the pellet by inverting the tube on a paper towel.  Leave to dry 
for 30 min.
  (xiv) Dissolve the pellet in 4 ml of TE buffer and combine the DNA from 
both tubes.  Check that exactly 8 ml is present.
  (xv) Add 8 g of CsCl and allow it to dissolve.
  (xvi) Transfer to a 18.5 ml ultracentrifuge tube (Sorvall polyallomer, 
catalogue number 03988) and top up the tube with 1gml-1 CsCl in TE 
buffer.
  (xvii) Add 150 ul of 10 mgml-1 ethidium bromide.
  (xviii) Balance the tubes with 1g ml-1 CsCl in TE solution and 
ultracentrifuge overnight at 50,000 rpm, 15oC in a Beckman TV 865 B 
rotor.
  (xix) Collect the DNA band using a large bore needle and syringe.  
Remove the DNA in a small volume (1 to 2 ml) of liquid.

  (xx) Remove the ethidium bromide by butanol extraction.  Prepare 
butanol by adding an equal volume of butanol to a saturated solution of 
CsCl.
  (xxi) To the DNA extract add an equal volume of the butanol, mix and 
allow the two phases to separate.
  (xxii) Transfer the lower aqueous phase to a clean tube and repeat the 
extractions 3 to 4 times until no pink colour remains in the aqueous layer.
  (xxiii) Dialyse the DNA overnight in TE buffer to remove the CsCl.
  (xxiv) Collect the DNA extract and store at -20oC.

 *  The yield of DNA should be between 35 and 70 ug from 5 g of plant 
tissue.

 *  We have found it necessary to add a final concentration of 1mM 
spermidine  (Sigma, catalogue number S-250) to restriction digestions
