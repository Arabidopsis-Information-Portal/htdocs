To estimate genetic consequences of radioactive contamination of plant
and animal populations, it is necessary to study the dynamic process
of mutation in chronically irradiated populations. It is necessary to
know the temporal accumulation of genetic load in chronically
irradiated populations per generation, to study the relationship of
the genetic load to the level of radioactive contamination.
Adaptability of different plant and animal species to the radiation
factor should be determined as well. All these problems are the
subjects of the research project started by us in 1986 in the 30km
zone of Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station (CNPS). One of the bio-objects
chosen for investigation is Arabidopsis thaliana found in abundance on
the contaminated territory.  It should be noted that the natural
populations of Arabidopsis in the area of the accident are represented
by a mixture of winter and spring forms, which impedes a little their
studies under the laboratory conditions. On the whole, any mutation
decreasing the fitness of their carriers may be considered as a
genetic load. We have used the embryo test to study the total
frequency of embryo lethal mutations and the frequency of those
chlorophyll mutations which become also lethal in the homozygote
state. The frequency of embryo lethals and chlorophyll mutations was
analysed in the generation of field material. To its end, the main
flower-bearing stems were cut off from plants growing on experimental
plots, brought to the laboratory and used for analysis. The lower
mature pods were collected for subsequent verification of the results
of analysis, the upper younger pods were examined with a binocular
lens to detect lethal embryos and embryos with chlorophyll mutations.
Three parameters of the mutation process are used in studying induced
mutagenesis by the embryo test: frequency of M1 plants producing
segregating offsprings (Ma), frequency of fruits (pods) containing
mutations on M1 plants (Mb), and frequency of mutants segregating in
M2 (Mc); >50 plants per population and 3-5 pods per plant were
analysed.<p>

Table 1 presents the results of the analysis of the genetic load in
the offspring of plants that grew on the contaminated territory in
1987. M2 plants were also used to analyse the lethality of M3 embryos.<p>

The relationship between the embryo lethal frequency and the dose rate
of chronic irradiation presented in Table 1 can be approximated best
of all by a power function. In particular, this relationship for Ma,
Mb, Mc, respectively, takes the following forms:<p>

yMa = 21,54x 0,25,      yMb = 11,59x 0,28,      yMc = 2,225x 0,30<p>

where x is the dose rate.<p>

Analysis of the regression equations obtained indicates that the
temporal growth of chronic irradiation dose rate exceeds the temporal
growth of mutagenic efficiency of radiation, which is seen from the
values of power indexes: 0,25, 0,28 and 0,30. Consequently, at
comparatively low dose rates the efficiency of ionizing radiation per
dose or dose rate unit is higher than at higher dose rates. In earlier
studies (SHEVCHENKO and POMERANCEVA, 1985), an interpretation of such
dose response relationship was presented. Monitoring of the mutation
load dynamics in successive generations may permit the specific
features of accumulation or elimination of the genetic load from the
Arabidopsis populations.<p>
