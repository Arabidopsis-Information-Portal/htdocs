Three plants of A. thaliana were found which originated evidently by
androgenesis. They appeared in the F1 generation from the cross C.
arenosa x A. thaliana.  The tetraploid (2n = 32) C. arenosa from the
locality Libcice near Praha (cf. population Nr. P 106; MESICEK, 1970)
was pollinated by a mixture of pollen grains taken successively from 4
winter-annual individuals of A. thaliana, race "Libcice".  These
individuals were treated with colchicine in October (apical meritems
of rosette plants), and used for the pollination the next spring.
Thus, the following microspores were expected to be present in the
used pollen mixture: a) haploid m. with n=5 produced by diploid
sectors or influorescences, b) polyhaploid m. with n = 10 arising from
tetraploid sectors, c) aneuhaploid m. and probably also some high
polyploid m. and d) sterile microspores.<p>

200 seeds were obtained from 42 pollinated flowers.  Embryos were well
developed, however, in only 9 seeds; while embryos at different
(deficient) stages of development were found in 20 seeds, and
underdeveloped or dwarfish ones in ca. 170 seeds.  The seeds of the
first category were furtehr differentiated in 3 groups with respect to
their size and structure (cf. Table).<p>

Three small seeds (embryos with incumbent radicles) were identical
with those of the diploid Arabidopsis thaliana, and this identity was
also confirmed in the mature plants: no differences were found between
the normal diploid Arabidopsis and the plants grown from these small
seeds. The meiosis in PMC's of these individuals was quite regular
(5II).<p>

x A. thaliana.<p>

From the data mentioned the conclusion may be drawn that the 3 small
seeds must have developed by androgenesis from the male nuclei of
diploid Arabidopsis microspores (=10).  Even though remarkable meiotic
disturbances and irregular chromosome pairing were often observed in
the tetraploid PMC's of the male parents treated by colchicine, in the
given case the number n = 10 must represent the complete diploid
chromosome set of Arabidopsis.  This assumption is obvious because of
the regular meiosis in the PMC's and the high fertility in the three
F1 plants.  Therefore these plants may be characterized as
pseudohaploids, i.e., autopolyhaploids.<p>
