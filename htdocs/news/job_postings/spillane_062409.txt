The Genetics & Biotechnology lab of Dr. Charles Spillane at 
University College Cork, Ireland is seeking applicant for a PhD 
position within the lab to work on genomic imprinting and gene 
dosage effects in Arabidopsis thaliana. The research will involve 
work on genetics, epigenetics, molecular biology, microscopy and 
genomics techniques, and significant exposure to bioinformatics. 
The successful applicants will work closely with postdocs and 
other research team members working on these areas within the 
lab. We are seeking highly motivated applicants who are eager to 
develop a long-term career in plant genetics research. In  
particular, we encourage applicants who have prior practical 
experience of Arabidopsis and/or plant molecular 
genetics/genomics research (e.g. as RAs, interns, etc) in research 
lab/institute settings. Applicants should send an e-mail outlining 
research interest and motivations, including; (a) your C.V. (list 
grades, interests and experimental skills) & (b) contact details and 
e-mail addresses for 3 referees to:

Dr. Charlie Spillane, Genetics & Biotechnology Lab, Biochemistry
