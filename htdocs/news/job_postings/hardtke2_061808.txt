A postdoctoral position is available starting in October 2008 or later in the lab of 
Christian Hardtke at the Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Lausanne, 
Switzerland. Our department offers excellent research infrastructure combined with a 
lively, interactive and international scientific community, located in the beautiful Lake 
Geneva region.

This position is funded by the University of Lausanne and includes a light teaching load 
(supervision and partial preparation of a practical, B.Sc. level lab course once per year). 
The candidate is expected to build on recent progress in our lab along the lines of one of 
our main projects:

1. Biochemical and cell biological analysis of transcriptional and post-translational 
hormonal control of the BRX family and interacting proteins in Arabidopsis development 
(building on Mouchel et al, Nature, 2006; & recent progress).

2. Molecular genetic analysis of natural variation in secondary growth of the Arabidopsis 
vasculature (building on Sibout et al., Current Biology, 2008; & recent progress).

3. Investigation of the impact of natural structural genome variation on plant performance 
(building on Shindo et al., New Phytologist, in press; & recent progress). This project 
requires a pronounced interest and ideally demonstrated expertise in bioinformatics 
approaches.

More details about the individual projects are available upon request.

Strongly motivated candidates with demonstrated expertise in molecular techniques are 
encouraged to apply.

Please forward applications including a curriculum vitae and contact information for two 
senior scientist referees by e-mail to christian.hardtke@unil.ch.
