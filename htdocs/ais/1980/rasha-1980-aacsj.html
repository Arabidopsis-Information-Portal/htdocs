Previously we have reported (Dishlers,Rashals, 1977) on the influence
of irradiation on the population of A. thaliana made up from three
races: En, vc'er and gl'an. The presence of intense directional and
stabilizing selection was shown, the basis of which was an increased
genotypic variability of populations caused by irradiation. However,
the kind of alterations in the correlations of characters under
irradiation, undoubtfully, considerably influencing the genetical
processes in populations subjected to selection, had not been studied.<p>

MATERIAL AND METHODS<p>

Air-dry seeds of the race vc'er were subjected to gamma-irradiation at
the doses of 10 and 40 kr. The irradiated and control plants were
grown under continuous illumination in plastic dishes filled with
soil. Four quantitative characters were studied: plant height, stalk
length, inflorescence length, and the number of internodes. The M2
generation was submitted to the family analysis.<p>

RESULTS<p>

The data obtained in the M1 and M2 are considered separately. Plant
response to the irradiation in every one of these two generations
gives information of various kinds. If the facts of M2 characterize
mainly the consequences of changes occurring in the genetic systems of
the organisms, the response of M1 shows mainly the physiological and
biochemical alterations of development induced by irradiation.<p>

Table 1 gives the mean values of the chaacters studied in M1. The data
presented show the different response of the characters to
irradiation. Treatment of seeds with gamma-rays at the dose of 10 kr
stimulated the development9 of the inflorescence by increasing its
length considerably, resulting in an increased plant height. The other
two characters yielded no significant changes. Irradiation at the dose
of 40 kr had a depressive effect on the development of vegetative
organs of the plants resulting in a decreased length. There was no
significant decrease in plant height since its majority is made by the
length of inflorescence almost no differing from the control at such
an irradiation.<p>

In Table 2 the coefficients of phenotypic correlation between the
characters in the generation of irradiation are demonstrated. As it
can be seen from the data all the characters of the control plants are
rather highly correlated. Under irradiation the alteration of
correlative relationships between the number of internodes and the
other characters were observed. After irradiation at the dose of 10 kr
the coefficients of correlation increased, but at the dose of 40 kr
they decreased below those of the control plants.<p>

As it can be seen in Table 1 the number of internodes was the only
character having no considerable alterations under irradiation. At the
same time the other characters showed a certain response to the
irradiation of one or another dose. In the result the irradiation
caused changes of correlative relationshps between the number of
internodes and the other characters.<p>

Table 3 presents the results of the interfamily analysis of variance
of the four investigated characters. Irradiation caused a significant
increase in the difference between the families. In variants under
irradition the genotypic variance sharply increased and accordingly
with its the heritability of the studied characters. This fact proves
the existence of intense mutation processes.<p>

The mutations depressed the development of the plants which is proved
by the data of Table 4 where a decrease of the mean value in M2 of the
characters studied is shown. A depression of the development is stated
also by treating the seeds with the dose of 10 kr, though under such a
dose a stimulating effect was observed in M1.<p>

in M2<p>

Table 5 presents the coefficients of correlation in M2. The
coefficients of genotypic correlation were stimulated by two ways, the
analysis of covariance and by calculating the correlation between the
family means. For all doses of irradiation between all the pairs of
characters the coordinated change of these coefficients is observed.
However, the absolute values of the coefficients of genotypic
correlation calculated by the covariation analysis are higher than
those calculated by the family means, and in some cases they surpassed
the value of 1.0. Therefore by comparison of the genetical correlation
between the characters the coefficients calculated on the basis of
family means were used.<p>

genotypic correlation calculated by the covariance analysis (r g) and
by the family means (r' g).<p>

The coefficients of phenotypic correlation between the characters
studied had no significant alterations though they tend to decrease
after the irradiation at the dose of 10 kr in pairs including the
number of internodes. The coefficients of genotypic correlation
decreased in this case significantly while the value of the
evironmental correlation did not change.<p>

DISCUSSION<p>

According to Table 3 it can be seen that gamma-irradiation appears to
be an effective factor increasing the genotypic variance of
quantitative characters in A. thaliana from two (the number of
internodes) to some ten times (the stalk length). Although the
mutations caused mainly the depression of the development of
characters, the chances of selection in opposite direction are
increased in the irradiated populations which was proved by the
experimental data obtained by Disherls and Rashals (1977). Similar
conclusions were made on A. thaliana by Brok (1967)<p>

Irradiation might cause significant changes in the correlative
interrelationships of quantitative characters of plants. Previously in
experiments with barley (Rashals, 1976) a wave like dependence of the
phenotypic correlations on the irradiation dose had been discovered:
the small doses having a stimulating effect caused a decrease, and
higher doses increased the correlative relationships of quantitative
characters in M2. In this work an increase in the level of the
genotypic correlation was shown at the radiation doses yielding
maximum mutagenic effect in M2 which could be explained by the
pleiotropic action of induced mutations. Decrease of the value of the
coefficient of phenotypic correlations has also been observed by the
experiment presented through the treatment of seeds at the stimulative
dose of irradiations (10 kr).<p>

At the higher dose of irradiation (40 kr) the genotypic correlations
are increased and reached the control level without surpassing it. On
one side, it is connected with high values of genotypic correlation in
the control, on the other side, it is possible that the dose of 40 kr
in the radio-resistant race vc'er is not high enough for inducing
mutations causing more closer correlative connections than in the
control.<p>

In M1 as well as in M2 most significant changes occurred in the
phenotypic and genotypic correlations within the characters paired
when the number of internodes is included. At the same time this is
the most stable character: the number of internodes in M1 had no
significant changes. The same character appeared to have the lowest
mutability. The given facts reveal that the possibility of alteration
of correlations between the quantitative characters are determined by
their unequal response to the action of extreme factors.<p>

Thus the irradiation causes both an increase in the degree of the
genetic variability of characters and changes in their genetic
correlation. These phenomena appear to be as a base for an increased
efficiency of the natural and artificial selection in tbe irradiated
populations. The possibility of changes in the genotypic correlations
is of rather great interest, because it determines considerably the
efficiency of indirect as well as complex selection.<p>
