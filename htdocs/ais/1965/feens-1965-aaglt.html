Vol 01S: <h2>Biochemical Genetics of Thiamine Biosynthesis</h2><p>

W. J. FEENSTRA<p>

As was reported in Arabid. Inf. Serv. 2 (FEENSTRA, 1965), we now have
at our disposal a large number of Arabidopsis mutants which, when
grown on a mineral medium, show a more or less strong chlorophyll
deficiency together with little or no growth beyond the cotyledon
stage.  When grown on substrates containing thiamine these mutants
show wild type growth.<p>

derivatives used.<p>

With respect to their growth requirements the mutants fall in three
classes: those which will grow already when given the pyrimidine
moiety; those for which the administration of the thiazole portion is
sufficient; and those which require the complete vitamin molecule (cf.
Figure 1).<p>

As reported (FEENSTRA, 1965) complementation tests yielded the
following results: all pyrimidineless mutants belong to one locus, or
to two closely linked loci; the thiazoleless mutants also belong to
one locus, or to two closely linked loci, whereas the mutants
requiring the complete thiamine, including a mutant growing on a
mixture of pyrimidine and thiazole, are distributed over at least 4
complementation groups (cistrons). Linkage data concerning the
thiamineless mutants are being sought, but not available yet.<p>

A large number of loci concerned with thiamine requirement seemed well
in agreement with the scheme for thiamine biosynthesis, as it has been
proposed by CAMIENER and BROWN, by LEDER and by NOSE et al., based on
biochemical studies with yeast (for ref. see BROWN, 1962). The scheme
(Figure 2) shows 5 possible sites for blocks in the biosynthesis
beyond the formation of pyrimidine and thiazole. In an attempt to
determine the exact sites of the blocks in the various mutants, a
mixture of the mono- and diphosphates of pyrimidine was prepared
according to the method of LEDER (1961) and separated by thin-layer
chromatography on cellulose.<p>

1962)<p>

Thiazole-monophosphate was obtained from thiazole and pyrophosphate
according to the method of WEYLAND (1942); the crude reaction mixture
was subjected to thin-layer chromotography and the main reaction
product isolated; it proved to be chromatographically identical with
the product, obtained by sulpholysis and partial hydrolysis of
cocarboxylase (thiamine diphosphate). An ethanol/water mixture (7 : 3,
by vol.) proved a good solvent for these compounds. Upon drying, it
leaves no residue, and it has the additional advantage that plates and
compounds are sterilized during the process. When drying and further
handling are carried out in a sterile cabinet, strile media are
readily obtained.  Thiamine monophosphate was purchased from Sigma
Chemical Company, St.  Louis, Mo, USA. Media were prepared as
described in an earlier publication (FEENSTRA, in press). Nutrient
solutions were obtained by extracting bands from the thin-layer
chromatograms with a mineral salt solution.<p>

Lines, representing the various mutant loci, were tested on the
various media. All of them developed normally on thiamine phosphate
but no growth was obtained on the other compounds. This would mean
that in all mutants the coupling reaction (VIII) is blocked, which
does not seem very probable. To check, whether the phosphorylated
compounds were active, a pyrimidineless and a thiazoleless mutant were
grown on them.  The thiazoleless mutant grew on thiazole phosphate,
the pyrimidineless mutant both on mono- and on diphosphate of
pyrimidine - as could be expected - but also on thiazole phosphate, or
rather on the fraction of the chromatogram, containing thiazole
phosphate.<p>

The latter, rather unexpected, result was tested with other
pyrimidineless mutants; their growth was stimulated, but not to the
same extent in all cases. Considering again the scheme of thiamine
synthesis in yeast, which seems to be rather well established, if we
have primarily to do with pyrimidine requirement, the block would be
in reaction I; thiazole phosphate requirement would put it in reaction
VI.  Assuming tht the thiazole phosphate is the active compound one is
tempted to look for an explanation in the seemingly roundabout way the
pathway leading to thiamine normally goes. Because of the
phosphorylation of the thiazole, the coupling of the pyrimidine and
thiazole moieties does not yield thiamine, but thiamine monophosphate,
which, according to SHIMAZONE et al. (1959) is dephosphorylated to
give free thiamine. The latter compound then acts as the substrata for
the pyrophosphorylation, the yield cocarboxylase, the form in which
thiamine is active in the oraganism. The coupling reaction (VII)
itself is a reversible one (LEDER, 1962), with its equilibrium far to
the side of thiamine phosphate. Now assuming that the actual block in
the synthesis lies in reaction VI, the phosphorylation of thiazole, it
could be imagined that, when thiazole phosphate is not formed, the
reaction proceeds also between free thiazole and pyrimidine
diphosphate, leading directly to thiamine. In vitro, the enzyme
isolated from yeast and calalysing the coupling reaction showed
specificity for thiazole phosphate only, and not for thiasole. It
might be, however, that the equilibrium in the reaction involving
thiazole, is far less favourable, and that in vivo, an increase in the
concentration of the precursors can lead to the formation of a
sufficient amount of thiamine. Administration of pyrmidine or its
phosphoric esters to the medium might give such an increase, and thus
lead to growth of the mutants. In this conception, a dosis of thiazole
shuld have the same result; there are indications, however, that
thiazole is inactivated in the plant. BONNER and BONNER (1948) mention
that in the leaves of normal plants of various species, pyrmidine, but
no thiazole, could be detected.<p>

The position of the block in the synthetic pathway must have
consequences for the accumulation of precursors. A block in reaction I
should never result in the accumulation of pyrmidine, but one in
reaction VI might do this. Actually, before we had any idea about the
possible activity of thiazole phosphate, we did an experiment in which
a pyrimidineless and a thiazoleless mutant were cultivated on media
containing fractions of hydrolysed and concentrated extracts of these
same mutants. Plant material for extraction was obtained by growing
the mutants on a limiting amount of thiamine. Growth of the
thiazoleless mutant was not stimulated, but the pyrmidineless mutant
showed a slight but clearly visible increase in growth, both on the
extract of the thiazoleless mutant and on the extract of material of
its own genotype.  Since the extracts had to be very much concentrated
to obtain this result, we can not exclude the possibility that the
pyrmidine still is derived from the small amount of thiamine supplied
to the plants. An accumulation of pyrimidine, however, would lend
support to the hypothesis that the so-called pyrmidineless mutants are
actually blocked in the phosphorylation of the thiazole, and should be
called thiazole phosphateless mutants. Further study of accumulated
products, and if possible, of the enzyme(s) involved, may lead to a
more definite conclusion.<p>

Anyhow, this story again contains the warning that very graet care
should be taken in assigning functions to genes, a mutation in which
leads to a deficiency which can be cured by giving some organic
compound. We are still left with the thiamineless mutants, to which no
precise function in the thiamine biosynthesis could be ascribed. In my
opinion it is very well possible that some or all of them have nothing
to do with the actual thiamine biosynthesis, but are concerned with
the functions thiamine has in the plant. In this respect is seems
worthwile mentioning that according to EBERHART and TATUM (1961) the
mutant gene thi-1 of Neurospora crassa, which causes thiamine
requirement, is concerned with the utilization of thiamine, vis. its
pyrophosphorylation to cocarboxylase.<p>

I will come back now to the genetical aspects of the
pyrimidine/thiazole phosphate requirement. The data obtained are
consistent with the hyypothesis that two adjacent cistrons, py-1 and
py- 2, are present, and that mutants of the class py-d contain a
deletion which covers parts of both py-1 and py-2. Recombination
experiments with all alleles belonging to py-1 and py-2 were carried
out by crossing the F1 of py-1 and py-2 to a py-d line. Without
recombination, offspring of this cross is of mutant type. Among a
total of 5881 plants, 3 were wild type, which means a recombination
frequency of about 1 x 10-3.  Spontaneous backmutation frequency was
determined in the homozygous py- 12, py-21 and py-d lines used; no
wild type plants were found among progenies consisting of 3670, 3960,
and 4260 plants, respectively.<p>

The situation as it has been found here reminds strongly, however, of
that found with certain loci in microorganisms, e.g., the ad 5/ad 7
locus in Neurosporo crassa. There too, two complementation groups have
been found, ad 5 and ad 7, which are complementary in producing wild
type heterokaryons, while alleles of a third group, ad 5/7, give
neither complementation with ad 5, nor with ad 7 (COSTELLO and BEVAN,
1964).  According to DORFMAN (1964), ad 5/7 alleles can backmutate to
wild type, suggesting that they are point mutations, although the
occurrence of suppressor mutations cannot be excluded.  This makes a
theory involving deletions less probable; other explanations of these
phenomena, e.g., in terms of an operon, are also possible, however.
Compared with the Neurospora investigations, our knowledge of the
situation in Arabidopsis is still very limited and only further
studies may yield the data on which some theory may be founded.
Further complementation and reombination studies, the former of which
have been initiated, are necessary, but will, even with Arabidopsis,
take considerable time.<p>

The recombination studies were carried out by Mr. H. MUTSAERS.<p>

Discussion:<p>

REDEI: How much is the complementation between py-1 and py-2?<p>

FEENSTRA: Fairly good. When the plants are a few weeks old, we see at
the leaf tips some indication of deficiency. The plants will flower,
but if we want to have a lot of seeds, we supply them with some
thiamine.<p>

REDEI: Do they belong to the same group as e.g., fungi where the
complementation is about 25% enzyme activity? And how many thiazole
loci do you have?<p>

FEENSTRA: As yet we have not established enzyme levels. We have three
groups of thiazoleless mutants, showing a complementation pattern
analogous to that of the pyrmidineless mutants. Your thiazoleless
mutants fall in the group 1 denote by tz-1.<p>

REDEI: And for thiamine there are also different loci?<p>

FEENSTRA: As yet we do not have indications of possible intrallelic
complementation between thiamineless mutants. We have established the
presence of at least 4 different complementation groups, one of these
is formed by Dr. LANGRIDGE's mutant. Crossing mutants of different
groups yields F1-s showing completely wild type growth. We have no
data on linkage yet, but experiments are under way.  As we do not have
double recessive types, we have to make test crosses to the wild type,
self for one generation and then in the next generation from ratio of
segregating to non-segregating progenies determine the recombination
frequency.<p>

BONOTTO: You made an extract, what kind of extract?<p>

FEENSTRA: We used a modification of the method of HARRIS (Arch.
Biochem. Biophys. 57, 240, 1955) for extraction of thiamine and
precursors from Neurospora. Dried leaf material was autoclaved in 0.5
n sulphuric acid, the solution was then neutralized, concentrated and
chromatographed, for we have the experience that on a nonfractionated
extract of leaf material seeds do not germinate.<p>

BONOTTO: Did you use these extracts in vivo or were these all in vitro
studies, regarding the biosynthesis of thiamine?<p>

FEENSTRA: Ours were all in vivo studies.<p>

REDEI: Did you find some precursors of pyrmidine or thiazole?  My
mutants did not respond of any of those compounds which in literature
are suggested as possible precursors for pyrimidine or for thiazole,
e.g., nucleic-acid pyrimidines, as has been quoted by BONNER 30 years
ago.<p>

FEENSTRA: I did not try that.<p>

REDEI: How did they respond to cocarboxylase? My mutants actually
responded less well to cocarboxylase than to thiamine or pyrmidine.
Isn't it the same what you find?<p>

FEENSTRA: I have not tested cocarboxylase yet; we only tested the
mono-phosphate of thiamine.<p>

JACOBS: Do you have some relations between the rate of growth of the
mutants and the position of the block in the metabolic pathway?<p>

FEENSTRA: I don't think so. Among these mutants we have some that die
at very early stages without developing their normal leaves, others
may grow up, but almost completely white, still others show some green
at the tip or the basis of the leaves, but I don't think I could
establish any relationship between requirement and growth on mineral
medium.<p>
