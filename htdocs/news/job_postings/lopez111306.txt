A post-doctoral position is available in the Department of Plant  Biology of the University of Geneva 
for a candidate with a strong  background in molecular biology and biochemistry. Ideally, the  candidate 
is also familiar with the Arabidopsis plant model system.

The project involves the study of the control of seed germination and  early growth by the phytohormones 
abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellic  acid (GA). The work will involve the molecular genetic  
characterization of key players in this process as well as the  identification of new ones 
(Lopez-Molina et al. Genes Dev. 2003 17(3): 410; Lopez-Molina et al. Plant J 2002 32(3):317; 
Lopez-Molina et al.  PNAS 2001 98(8):4782).
The laboratory is located in Sciences III, a brand new building that  hosts, in addition to the Department 
of Plant Biology, the  Departments of Animal Biology, Molecular Biology and Cell Biology.  The 
department has State-of-the-art research facilities and full time  staff responsible for the 
maintenance of plant growth chambers and  equipment.
To apply, please email a curriculum vitae as well as names and  contact information of three references to:
