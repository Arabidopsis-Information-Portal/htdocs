Chlorophyll mutants have been very useful test organisms to study
growth and differentiation in higher plants (Venketeswaran and
Mahlberg, 1962; Hemphill and Venketeswaran, 1976).  Growth in higher
plants occurs by a series of very orderly division of the cells at the
meristematic regions in various parts of the plant, particularly in
the shoot, root and leaf meristem. As growth proceeds, specialization
of the cells leads to formation of distinct mature tissues which
perform specific functions.  Genes present in the meristems are
influenced by both external and internal conditions and this manifests
in various sorts of cellular differentiation. Sterile tissue culture
techniques provide an ideal way to study the interaction of these
genes. With such an approach, the present study was carried out on a
recessive mutant on Arabidopsis, im.  A number of previous studies
have been reported on this mutant (Redei, 1965 a, b, 1967; Redei, et
al., 1974; Redei and Purad, 1974).<p>

Seeds of Arabidopsis, im mutant were kindly supplied by Professor G.P.
Redei for these investigations.  Standard procedures of tissue culture
techniques were used (Venketeswaran and Mahlberg, 1962).  In brief,
the seeds were surface-sterilized in 0.1% HgCl2 or in a mixture of 2%
calcium hypochlorite and 0.1% HgCl2 for 5-8 minutes and later washed
3-5 times in sterile distilled water. Seeds were then germinated in
petri plates either on wet filter paper or in simple agar medium at 25
+/- 1*degree*C in a culture room.  After 4-5 days, individual
seedlings were transferred to a modified completely defined culture
medium containing major and minor elements + B-vitamin mixture
(Murashe and Skoog, 1962) and 2% sucrose. This medium served as the
control minimal medium.  Indoleacetic acid (IAA) at 1 x 1-E-5M or
1-E-6J, 2, 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4-D) at 1 x 10E-6 M were
added either separately or in combination in certain experiments.  In
other experiments, casein hydrolysate was supplemented to the culture
medium in varying concentrations. Seven grams per liter of Difco-Bacto
agar were used to solidify the medium.  Cultures were maintained in a
culture room at 25 +/- 1*degree*C with illumination for 12 hours/day
under Sylvania "Gro-Lux" lamps. The intensity of illumination in the
culture room, as recorded by a Weston Illumination Meter Model 756
ranged from 540-1.600 lux.  Low intensity of illumination was provided
for the cultures by filtering the light through 4-8 layers of cheese
cloth (200-540 lux).<p>

Seedlings initially sown in petri plates germinated in 4-5 days and
produced no further growth.  Many of the seedlings had green
cotyledons although some of the individual cells observed under low
power stereo-microscope were nonpigmented.  Details of the growth
nature, pigmentation, etc., of this mutant were described previously
(Redei, 1965a).<p>

Individual seedlings when transferred to test tubes containing the
minimal culture medium or supplemented with different growth factors
developed beyond the seedling stage and responded differently.
Continued growth of the seedlings in respective media resulted in stem
elongation, formation of rosette leaves on the surface of the culture
medium or leaves on the stem.  In the minimal medium, there was little
growth. After 2 weeks in culture, the seedlings showed elongation,
formation of rosette leaves on the surface of the culture medium or
leaves on the stem.  In the minimal medium, there was little growth.
After 2 weeks in culture, the seedling showed elongation of the stem
apex and after 4 weeks, rosette leaves had formed in some cultures
(Figures 1 and 2a).  In cultures growing in medium containing 10E-5 M
IAA or 1-E-6 M IAA, after 2 and 4 weeks in culture, a more pronounced
growth was observed (Figures 1 and 2b and 2c).  The leaves were very
succulent and elongated.  Many of the rosette leaves were curled but
they showed variation in their size.  Most of these leaves had a broad
laminar portion, approximately 0.3-0.6 mm in width. Both the succulent
and broad-leaved leaves appeared visually green in some cases.
Microscopic examination of such leaves showed that there was no
definite pattern of variegation of green and white patches.  Only
occasionally, some of the leaves appeared totally white or totally
green. Consequently, it was difficult to determine the true genetic
nature of the cells in the green and white regions.<p>

When seedlings were placed in a culture medium containing 1 x 10E-6 M
IAA and 2, 4-D, callus initiation took place from the region of the
hypocotyl.  Continued proliferation of this tissue eventually produced
an actively growing culture. The callus appeared generally yellow or
yellowish-brown.  No green or white cali were obtained. Cytological
observations showed a number of viable cells; no visible chloroplasts
were evident. After 8-10 weeks in culture, solid calli transferred to
liquid medium and maintained in a rotary shaker produced suspension
cultures.  Plating expriments were caried out by inocculating a heavy
suspension of cells to agar plates; but only limited success was
obtained. Studies on callus and suspension culture of Arabidopsis
strains have been reported by various workers (Corcos, Piper and
Lewid, 1973; Gresshoff and Doy, 1973; Demchenko, Avetisov and Butenko,
1973; Negrutiu, Beeftink and Jacobs, 1975).<p>

Isolation of protoplasts were attempted from mesophyll cells of leaves
grown in culture as described by recent techniques (see Negrutiu,
Beeftink and Jacobs, 1975).  The young succulent leaves appear to be
most promising.<p>

The results of this study indicate that the development of the
chlorophyll apparatus in the Arabidopsis im mutant will depend on a
number of chemical and physical factors employed under specific
culture conditions.  One observation, which may be of specific
interest is that plants which appear totally green can be obtained
under certain conditions. Further experimental work in production of
seeds from these visible green plants is needed to suggest an
explanation of this phenomenon.  Other workers on this mutant (Redei,
1965a) and other chlorophyll mutants (Robbelen 1965; Demchenko,
Aventisov and Butenko, 1973) have given some interpretation to the
phenomenon of the mutation, nature of variegation, etc.  It appears
from this study that it is very difficult to attribute any single
explanation. Recent techniques of protoplast isolation and successful
culture of them and its application to the study of somatic cell
genetics offer great potentialities. They are excellent single cell
systems and can respond differently in their growth and morphogenesis.
They also will be useful in planning selection experiments of somatic
hybrids resulting from fusion of protoplasts of different cells.<p>
