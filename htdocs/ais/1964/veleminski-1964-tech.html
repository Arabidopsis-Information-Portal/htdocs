AIS Vol 01:<h2>Sterile culture of Arabidopsis on agar medium
J. VELEMINSKY, and T. GICHNER</h2>

The cultivation of Arabidopsis thaliana on inorganic agar medium under
aseptic conditions is a very useful method for physiological genetics.
After the first detailed description of this method (LANGRIDGE 1957b)
the cultivation of Arabidopsis on artificial medium became routine in
many laboratories.  It is, however, evident that all these
laboratories have their own modifications which are given both by the
experience of the research workers and by their equipment.  In
addition to this, in laboratories, dealing with the identification of
nutritionally deficient mutants, different modifications of the
maximal medium are used.  The method used in our laboratory is
essentially derived from the above mentioned work of LANGRIDGE, as
well as from KVITKO (1960) and MULLER (unpubl.)

The recipe for the preparation of the nutrient medium first sets the
following 7 stock solutions:<p>
<pre><tt>
A) KNO3                  20 g
B) Mg SO4. H2O            3 g
C) Ca (NO3)2. 4 H2O      10 g
D) K2 HPO4                3 g
E) Fe SO4. 7 H2O          1.4 g
F) EDTA (Na,-salt)       10 g
G) trace elements, consisting of:
   H3BO4                  1.5 g
   Mn SO4. 7 H2O          0.9 g
   Zn SO4                 0.13 g
   Cu SO4. 5 H2O          0.05 g
   (NH4)6 Mo7 O24         0.5 g
</tt></pre>


Stocks A to G each made up to 1 litre with aqua dest.  The solution E
of Fe SO4. 7 H2) must be prepared just before the preparation of the
nutrient solution.  The other 6 solutions (A-D and F-G) may be kept in
a refrigerator for several months.<p>

The final nutrient solution should be made with the following amounts
and in the following sequence:<p>

50 ml of each A + B + C + D + E + 5 ml F + 1 ml G

To the solution obtained 8 g of agar is added and the total made up to
1 litre with bi distilled water.  If the agar is powdered no special
care is necessary, but if in chunks, it must be broken into small
pieces. The solution is then autoclaved (15 to 30 min; 1.5-2.5 atm)
and while still hot poured into sterile glass vessels or test tubes.
50 ml of the nutrition solution is used in Petri dishes, jars or
Erlemmeyer flasks with a diameter of the bottom of 9 cm, whereas in
test tubes (15 x 170 mm) 5 ml of the solution is dispensed.  The test
tubes, used for individual cultures, and the Erlenmeyer flasks, used
for large scale cultures, are plugged with Kapsenberg's plugs or
cellulose wadding covered with cellophane.  The jars are covered with
lids.  LANGRIDGE (1957b) packed the space round the lid with cotton
wool pretreated with cethyl piridinium chloride (0, 1 percent in
chloroform solution) to keep the cultures aseptic.  For cultivation of
plants to maturity in addition to test tubes, big Erlenmeyer flasks
and jars are used the lids of which are removed when the larger flower
stalks grow too high.  The slight sterility frequently observed due to
pollen abortion is higher in tubes than in the larger vesels (JACOBS,
unpubl.).  Petri dishes are appropriate for the cultivation of plants
to butonisation, but even here the plants may be kept up to maturity
under suitable conditions.<p>

For sterilization dry seeds are immersed in a 2% solution of
chloramine B for 5 to 10 min, then washed in sterile water in a
sterile vessel.  The washing as well as the following procedures is
best done in a sterile box (sterilized chemically with e.g. Zephiron
and/or with UV- light) or in a Hansen's chamber.  As another simple
method of seed sterilization LANGRIDE (1957b) used a mixture of
absolute ehthanol + 20% H2 02 (1:1) for 10 min and ROBBELEN (unpubl.)
1% bromine-water for 5-10 min both without any washing after the
treatment, JACOBS (unpubl.) 3,5% Calcium hypochlorite for 5 min.<p>

The seeds are then planted on the solid agar by a Pasteur's pipette
with an air ball in a sterile box under UV-light.  The planting,
however, may also be done without a sterile box if the sterility
demanded may be lower.  The seeds are sucked up with a small amount of
water and released to the agar.  This no doubt works faster than
planting with a platin loop.  The diameter of the pipette, however,
must only be a little larger than the diameter of the seeds to avoid
any surplus of water which would inhibit germination.  To escape from
the same complication ROBBELEN (unpubl.) uses 45*degrees* slope agar
in his tubes so that the superfluous water runs down. To stimulate
germination sometimes it is recommended to keep the cultures in cold
(0-5*degrees*C) for 24 hrs after planting, but with some material this
can be certainly omitted.  Wooden blocks are used as test tube holders
with holes as high as the agar medium, as an exposure of the roots to
light may inhibit growth (LANGRIDGE 1957b).<p>

When a phytotron or other growth chambers with some regulatory systems
are at hand, the following cultural conditions should be arranged
(LANGRIDGE 1957b): temperature 25*degrees*C with continuous
illumination of 800 - 12.000 f.c., i.e., 8.600 - 13.800 lux and a
relative humidity above 60%.  Fluorescent light tubes are convenient
light sources.  In less equipped conditions the cultivation of
Arabidopsis is possible at temperatures between 10 and 30 *degrees*C,
but a temperature of about 20*degrees*C is needed for good
germination.  Just so continuous illumination is not obligatory but a
16 hrs day- length is also very suitable for plant growth. Even a
light intensity of about 3.000 lux is sufficient.<p>
