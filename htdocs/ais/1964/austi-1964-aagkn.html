Vol 01:<h2>AUSTIN, R. B.</h2><h2>Heritable variation after phosphorus deficiency</h2>

The amounts of phosphorus in pea and watercress (Pisum and Roripa
spp.) seed as affected by the nutrition of the parent plants were
found to influence the growth and yield of the plants raised from such
seed, both on phosphorus deficient and normal media.  It further
appeared that the plant-to-plant variability (as measured by
(S(x-xbar)^2)/n when x=log fresh weight of plant) was greater in
populations grown from phosphorus deficient than from normal seeds,
both in deficient and normal media.<p>

These results were thought to warrant further testing in order to
discriminate between the possibilities that (1) heritable variation
was generated by the phosphorus deficiency treatments and (2) plants
grown in conditions of phosphorus stress revealed latent genetic
variation in response to phosphorus deficiency.  Arabidopsis thaliana,
strain ESTLAND, is being employed for this work, and it is being grown
in a glasshouse in pots containing vermiculite and supplied with
Hewitt's nutrient solution modified to contain either 0.4 or 4.0
milligram equivalents of phosphorus per litre.  The cultures are not
aseptic.<p>
